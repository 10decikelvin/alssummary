  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A due to its chemically appropriate methodology, more sophisticated research question, and thorough consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. The most critical distinction is the experimental design. Essay B correctly identifies that a redox titration is a specific and accurate method for quantifying ascorbic acid, stating, \"the investigation involved redox titration. The beverages (analytes) were titrated with iodine to oxidise ascorbic acid into dehydroascorbic acid.\" In contrast, Essay A employs a general acid-base titration, a fundamentally flawed approach for this context. Essay A even acknowledges this fatal flaw in its own evaluation: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid,\" meaning its method measures total acidity rather than the specified dependent variable.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices...and their vitamin C...concentration,\" is more focused, detailed, and analytical than Essay A's simpler comparative question. Essay B's inclusion of specific temperature values and the evaluative phrase \"To what extent\" signals a more complex investigation. Finally, Essay B excels in addressing safety, ethical, and environmental concerns, which are almost entirely absent in Essay A. Essay B provides specific safety measures like using \"tongs to prevent skin burns,\" discusses the ethical issue of food waste, and considers the environmental impact of energy consumption. Essay A's safety section is minimal and its complete omission of ethical and environmental considerations is a significant weakness for a lab-based investigation. While both essays present a clear personal motivation and identify variables, Essay B's superior scientific rigor and comprehensive planning make it the better submission.",
