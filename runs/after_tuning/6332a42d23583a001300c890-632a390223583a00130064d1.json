  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its more detailed and thoughtful approach, particularly concerning the variables and safety/ethical/environmental considerations.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is clear and focused. The background appropriately covers collision theory and the Arrhenius equation. However, its variables section is adequate but less comprehensive than Essay B's. For instance, while it lists controlled variables like \"The amount... and the molarity of the reactants,\" it lacks the depth seen in Essay B. The safety section is also somewhat generic, with control measures like \"Very careful operations during the experiment.\"\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is exceptionally clear and specific, immediately defining the range of the independent variable. Its methodology is appropriate and demonstrates a higher level of complexity by combining chemical preparation with physical testing using modern equipment. The variables section is a key strength, presented in a clear table that not only lists controlled variables with justifications but also insightfully identifies uncontrolled variables like \"Uniform Depth of Sample\" and their potential impact. Furthermore, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are more specific and nuanced. It addresses safety with clear actions like \"use heat resistant gloves,\" presents a thoughtful ethical point on \"Use of edible materials,\" and provides a relevant environmental disposal plan: \"they should be compostable and easily biodegradable.\" This comprehensive and critical approach to the experimental design makes it the stronger submission.",
