  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much deeper and more thorough approach to the experimental design process. Essay B's research question is superior in its specificity and complexity, stating \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction...\". This clearly outlines the quantitative goal, reaction conditions, independent variable range, and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid...\", while clear, is less sophisticated and more descriptive than explanatory.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background provides a comprehensive theoretical framework, explaining the reaction mechanism, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are essential for its investigation. Essay A's background is relevant but critically flawed because it fails to address that its chosen methodology (acid-base titration) will neutralize all acids in the juice (citric, malic, etc.), not just ascorbic acid. Essay A only acknowledges this fatal flaw in its limitations table, stating \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This oversight makes the entire methodology inappropriate for answering the research question.\n\nIn terms of variables and control, Essay B again excels, providing detailed justifications for its choices, often referencing preliminary trials, as seen in its independent variable table: \"These specific temperatures were Selected as from preliminary testing, the reaction at 70\u00baC was too quick...\". This demonstrates a more mature and engaged experimental design process compared to Essay A's more standard, though acceptable, variable table.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety and environmental considerations starkly separates the two. Essay B provides a detailed, chemical-specific table outlining risks and mitigations (\"Sulfuric acid... Causes severe skin burns or blisters and eye damage... wear protective gloves, clothing and face shield\") and explicit disposal instructions (\"Do not wash down the sink as it is harmful to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation\"). Essay A's approach is dangerously minimal, claiming \"Gloves are not necessary... due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH\", and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical factors.",
