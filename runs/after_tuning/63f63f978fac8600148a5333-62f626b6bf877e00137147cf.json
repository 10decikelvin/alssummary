  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement and adherence to the requirements of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is highly specific, clearly defining the independent variable's range and the precise method of quantification. In contrast, Essay B's research question is less detailed, lacking a specified range for the independent variable (\"expiration date\"). The most significant difference lies in the background information; Essay A provides a comprehensive, well-researched background covering biosorption chemistry, the role of pH, and the principles of spectrophotometry, whereas Essay B's introduction is a single, generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\".\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its methodology and experimental design. It includes a detailed table of variables with justifications for why each controlled variable is significant, for instance, explaining that for temperature, \"Pectin also breaks down at higher temperatures... resulting in an overall lower percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions.\" Essay B completely lacks a dedicated section identifying and justifying its variables, a critical omission. While Essay B does provide a specific risk assessment, mentioning that \"Ethanol should be kept away from heat as it is very flammable,\" Essay A provides a more complete treatment by explicitly addressing safety, ethics, and environmental concerns, including specific disposal instructions: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\". Essay A's inclusion of preliminary trials and thoughtful methodological choices, such as using a centrifuge, further showcases a superior level of scientific exploration.",
