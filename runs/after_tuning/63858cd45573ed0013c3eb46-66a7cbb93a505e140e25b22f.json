  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is superior, primarily due to its meticulous experimental design, robust control of variables, and more detailed considerations of safety and the environment. Both essays are experimental investigations.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core components, Essay A presents a clearer and more scientifically sound plan. While Essay B has a well-phrased research question, stating, \"How do different active ingredients...in different brands of indigestion tablets (antacids A, B, and C) compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\", its methodology contains a critical flaw. Essay B explicitly states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This decision undermines the entire investigation, as a fair comparison of chemical effectiveness requires a controlled mass of the active substance. In contrast, Essay A demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of variable control. For instance, it attempts to control the catalyst's surface area by specifying, \"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure,\" and ensures uniform mixing by using a \"stir bar for 1 minute on setting 6.\" This attention to detail in the methodology makes Essay A's approach far more rigorous.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay A is more focused and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical principles. Essay A explains the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis, stating, \"heterogenous catalysis is characterized by the adsorption of reactant molecules to these active sites, meaning their availability can greatly limit the rate of heterogeneous reactions.\" This level of detail directly links the theory to the experimental variables. While Essay B's background is relevant, it is more descriptive and less mechanistic.\n\nFinally, Essay A's treatment of safety and environmental considerations is more specific and thorough. For safety, Essay A cites a source (CLEAPPS) and differentiates between hazards based on concentration: \"Concentrated H\u2082O\u2082 solution (8% < C < 30%) is corrosive... To reduce risk for this investigation, 3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution was used.\" Essay B's safety note is generic: \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\" Similarly, Essay A's environmental section references the \"12 Principles of Green Chemistry\" and specifies disposal protocol: \"foam produced were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal.\" Essay B's environmental point is less detailed. Overall, Essay A consistently demonstrates a higher level of scientific thought and meticulousness in its experimental plan.",
