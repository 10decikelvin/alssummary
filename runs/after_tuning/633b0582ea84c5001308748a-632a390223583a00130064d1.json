  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is highly focused and specific, clearly defining the independent variable's range and the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A poses two separate, less specific questions: \"Does the number of carbon atoms... affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\" and \"...affect its boiling point?\". While Essay A has relevant background information, Essay B's background is more thorough, defining key terms like plasticizers and Young's Modulus and even providing the necessary equations.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and variables. Essay B, an experimental investigation, provides an exemplary methodology. The variables are not just listed but presented in a detailed table explaining how they are controlled and why that control is important, as seen in \"Amount of Cornstarch... To ensure that all samples have the same amount of Cornstarch to polymerize... measured with a scale with an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.01g.\" Essay B also commendably identifies uncontrolled variables. Essay A's methodology is appropriate for its data-based approach but lacks this level of detail and procedural rigor. Finally, Essay B excels in its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are required for an experiment. It provides specific safety measures (\"use heat resistant gloves whenever using the beaker\"), a thoughtful ethical point (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that... food and water are being wasted.\"), and clear environmental disposal instructions (\"they should be compostable and easily biodegradable\"). As a data-based study, Essay A is not required to have such an extensive section, but Essay B's comprehensive and well-structured approach to all aspects of the experimental design makes it the stronger piece of work.",
