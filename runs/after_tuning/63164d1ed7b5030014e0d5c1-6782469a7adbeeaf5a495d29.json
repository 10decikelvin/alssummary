  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific engagement, depth, and methodological rigor. Its research question is exceptionally detailed, specifying the analytical method, reaction conditions, and a precise concentration range: \"for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity. Essay B's background is also far more advanced, establishing a strong real-world context (\"release of dyes, like MO, into water bodies, accounts for nearly 20% of industrial water pollution\") and using literature to explain complex concepts like the \"scavenging effect,\" which directly justifies its experimental design. Essay A's background is relevant but its rationale is based on a simple personal anecdote (\"my mother was talking to me about why I should be eating more fruits and vegetables\").\n\nMethodologically, Essay B excels by explicitly detailing how preliminary trials informed its procedure, a key indicator of thorough exploration: \"it was observed that there was a major change between the first reading at t=0 and the second reading at t=15... Hence, aliquots were subsequently pipetted out every 4 minutes... to better model the full kinetics of the reaction.\" Essay A presents a standard, appropriate procedure but shows no evidence of such refinement. Furthermore, Essay B's handling of controlled variables in a justified table is more comprehensive than Essay A's list. Finally, while both address safety, Essay B's environmental consideration (\"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\") is more specific and contextually relevant than Essay A's simple statement of \"No significant environmental concerns.\"",
