  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly sophisticated and scientifically grounded exploration. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally detailed, specifying not only the reactants and method but also the precise conditions and variable range: \"in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This specificity is far beyond that of Essay B's clear but standard question. Furthermore, Essay A's background is rooted in scientific literature, explaining complex concepts like the \"Photo-Fenton reaction\" and the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2,\" which directly informs and justifies the methodological choices. In contrast, Essay B's rationale is largely personal (\"As a person who always loved coffee... I normally got feelings of heartburn\") and its background provides only basic chemical principles.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is meticulous, detailing preliminary trials used to refine the procedure and demonstrating outstanding control of variables with clear justifications for *why* and *how* each is kept constant. For instance, it explains the need to control the \"Surface area of reactants exposed to UV-light\" and how using the \"same type of 100 cm\u00b3 beaker\" achieves this. Conversely, Essay B contains a critical flaw in its experimental design by explicitly choosing not to control for the mass of the tablets: \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This fundamentally undermines the investigation's goal of comparing effectiveness, as any difference in volume neutralized could be due to differing tablet masses rather than the active ingredients. While both essays are experimental and adequately address safety and environmental considerations, Essay A's depth of research, robust methodology, and clear link between background theory and experimental practice make it a significantly stronger example of IB-level exploration.",
