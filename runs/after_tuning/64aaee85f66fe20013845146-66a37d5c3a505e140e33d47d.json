  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior across all assessed components of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration measured by redox titration?\" is significantly stronger than Essay A's. It includes evaluative language (\"To what extent\") and specifies the exact levels of the independent variable, demonstrating a more focused and sophisticated approach compared to Essay A's simpler \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea\".\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology and variable control are more rigorous. The background provides the specific chemical equation for the redox reaction, and the controlled variables table includes thoughtful considerations like \"The concentration of iodine solution had to be kept constant... [to not] affect the volume of titrant used\". In contrast, Essay A's justification for controlling temperature suggests a lack of foresight, stating, \"This is controlled because it was discovered during the experiment that the solvent reacts with the tea\".\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental issues. Both are experimental investigations requiring this section. Essay B thoroughly addresses all three aspects, providing specific details such as preventing burns from the \"heating plate,\" minimizing food waste as an ethical issue (\"the least possible amount of fruits was used\"), and reducing energy consumption as an environmental concern (\"heating plate... was powered off and unplugged when it was not used\"). Essay A provides adequate safety precautions but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw, especially given its use of a chlorinated solvent (dichloromethane). This comprehensive approach in Essay B showcases a much higher level of planning and scientific responsibility.",
