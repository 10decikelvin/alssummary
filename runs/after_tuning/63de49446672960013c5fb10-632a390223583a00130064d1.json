  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay A is superior due to its more profound chemical exploration and methodological development. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is clear, focused, and includes the evaluative phrase \"to what extent.\" Its background information is exceptionally strong, not only explaining the principles of UV-Vis spectrometry but also identifying a key methodological problem (the B6 solution being colorless) and providing a sophisticated, well-researched solution involving complexation with copper(II) ions, supported by an explanation of crystal field theory. The inclusion of a detailed \"Development and pilot studies\" section, where the student addresses issues like tablet binders and precipitate formation, demonstrates an excellent, authentic investigative process.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also excellent, with a clearly defined independent variable range. The methodology is appropriate and detailed, and its identification of both controlled and uncontrolled variables in tables is a significant strength. Essay B also has a more thoughtful and developed section on ethical and environmental considerations, specifically addressing the use of food materials (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\"). However, its background, while relevant in defining Young's Modulus, lacks the chemical depth seen in Essay A; it doesn't explain the theoretical chemical interaction between sodium bicarbonate and the starch-glycerol polymer that would cause changes in elasticity.\n\nUltimately, Essay A's exploration is more impressive. The student demonstrates a deeper engagement with the underlying chemistry and shows evidence of overcoming challenges through research and pilot work (e.g., \"I chose to implement the concept micelles formation... a pilot study was conducted to determine a suitable replacement\"), which is the essence of a high-quality investigation. While Essay B is very well-structured, Essay A's demonstration of chemical problem-solving within the methodology itself elevates it to a higher level.",
