  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it provides a complete and well-structured scientific exploration, whereas Essay B is incomplete and lacks critical components of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is clear, focused, and specifies the measurement technique. It is supported by an excellent background section that explains relevant chemical principles like the \"salting in effect\" and \"charge density.\" In contrast, Essay B's background is a single sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution,\" which provides no context for the investigation.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and identification of variables. Essay A meticulously outlines its independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a detailed table, explaining both why and how each variable was controlled (e.g., \"Temperature | Solubility increases with increase in temperature... | The temperature function of the magnetic stirrer was used...\"). Essay B completely fails to identify or discuss its variables, a critical omission for experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is logical and includes a preliminary calibration experiment, demonstrating thorough planning. Essay B's procedure is presented as an incomplete list that confusingly begins at step 6, indicating a poorly structured and possibly unfinished document.\n\nWhile Essay B does have a more detailed risk assessment section, listing specific chemical hazards like \"EDTA, Eriochrome Black T, Ethanol, and Ammonia Buffer when applied to the skin solution are very corrosive,\" and briefly mentions environmental disposal, this does not compensate for its fundamental weaknesses. Essay A's safety section is adequate for the chemicals used. Ultimately, Essay A demonstrates a comprehensive and scientifically sound approach to investigation design, while Essay B is a fragmented submission missing the core elements of background, variable control, and a coherent methodology.",
