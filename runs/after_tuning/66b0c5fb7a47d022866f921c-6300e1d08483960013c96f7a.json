  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially stronger than Essay B, primarily due to its rigorous experimental design, thorough consideration of variables, and complete risk assessment. Essay A's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear, focused, and investigated using an appropriate and detailed calorimetry methodology. The author demonstrates a strong understanding of experimental control, as shown in the controlled variables table which includes specific actions like setting the \"air conditioner... to 25\u00b0C\" and using the \"same copper calorimeter\" to ensure consistency. Furthermore, Essay A includes a complete and specific risk assessment, addressing safety (\"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\"), ethics (\"No ethical considerations\"), and environmental impact (\"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question (\"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\"), suffers from a flawed methodology and a critical omission of risk assessment. The experimental design is weak; for example, it relies on controlling the \"Salt mass\" by measuring \"only 5 grams of each salt,\" which is a poor choice since the background theory presented relies on the number of ions, meaning moles should have been kept constant, not mass. The method for controlling temperature (\"Experimenting in the same place and time\") is vague and lacks rigor. Most importantly, Essay B completely fails to address any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major oversight for an experimental investigation. While Essay B's background is relevant, the weaknesses in its methodology and the absence of a risk assessment make Essay A the clearly superior submission for Criterion B.",
