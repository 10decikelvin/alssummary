  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured investigations. Essay A has a very clear and focused research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", which is well-supported by relevant background information on electrolysis and Faraday's laws. Its methodology and variable identification are clear. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and thoroughness. Its research question, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is exceptionally precise, even specifying the analytical technique. The background information on complexometric titration is detailed and appropriate. Most notably, Essay B's handling of controlled variables is superior; it not only lists the variables and how they are controlled but also explains the significance of controlling them, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the experimental design. Furthermore, its safety and environmental considerations are more detailed and specific than Essay A's. While Essay A is good, Essay B's comprehensive approach to variables and safety protocols, along with its more complex methodology, makes it the stronger submission for this criterion.",
