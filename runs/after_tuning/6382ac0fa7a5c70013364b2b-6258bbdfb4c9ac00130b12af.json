  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. The fundamental quality of the investigation, starting with the research question, is much higher in Essay B. Essay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\" is focused, clear, and highly specific, detailing the independent variable, its precise range, and the dependent variables to be measured. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...\" is a comparative study but lacks the specificity and scientific depth of Essay B's.\n\nThis initial strength in Essay B is carried through to its experimental design. Essay B correctly identifies its variables, providing a detailed table of controlled variables with clear explanations for \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\". Essay A, however, makes a critical error by misidentifying its independent variable as \"Mass of sample before titrating\" and \"Mass of sample before heating.\" The true independent variable is the source of the calcium carbonate (chalk, rangoli, seashell), and the mass should have been a controlled variable. This reveals a significant weakness in Essay A's understanding of experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is more robust, including a \"Justification for methodology\" section that explains the choices of temperature range and chemical concentrations. The background information in Essay B is also more scientifically focused, explaining the chemical principles of acid value and saponification value, which directly underpin the investigation. Essay A's background is more of a personal narrative about sample selection. Finally, Essay B provides a comprehensive risk assessment that explicitly addresses safety, ethical (\"There were no ethical issues in this investigation...\"), and environmental considerations in detail. Essay A provides good safety and environmental details but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, making its assessment incomplete.",
