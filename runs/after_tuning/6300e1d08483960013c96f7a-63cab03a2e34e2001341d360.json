  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior due to its sophisticated methodology and thorough consideration of safety and environmental factors, which are critical for an experimental investigation. While Essay A presents a clearer and more focused research question (\"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\"), its overall exploration is significantly weaker. Essay B's methodology is complex and detailed, including advanced procedures like the \"Standardization of Sodium Thiosulfate\" and explicitly planning for multiple trials to \"deal with random error.\" In contrast, Essay A's method is overly simple and describes a sequential process that fails to properly control its own stated variable of \"Surrounding temperature and pressure.\" The most critical differentiator is the risk assessment. Essay B provides an excellent, specific \"Risk Assessment\" table, noting hazards for each chemical (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\") and appropriate precautions. It also addresses environmental impact, stating \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals.\" Essay A completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major failure for an experimental IA. Therefore, Essay B's depth, methodological rigor, and adherence to safety protocols make it the better piece of work.",
