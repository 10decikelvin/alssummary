  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its superior research question and more thoroughly developed methodology, which are core components of Criterion B. Essay B presents a multi-part research question that is both focused and detailed: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol... between isomeric alcohols?\". This specificity, including the exact range of carbon atoms, demonstrates a higher level of planning than Essay A's broader question, \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\". Furthermore, Essay B's methodology for its experimental investigation is exemplary, featuring a detailed, replicable procedure and an outstanding table of controlled variables that not only identifies the variables but also justifies why and how they are controlled.\n\nEssay A presents a competent data-based investigation. Its methodology is appropriate for its research question, correctly identifying reliable databases like NIST and HSDB and specifying how data would be processed, such as \"when the data was given in a range, I took its midpoint\". The background information is relevant and provides good context. However, the overall scope and detail of the exploration design fall short of Essay B. The research question lacks the specificity seen in Essay B, and the investigation's complexity is lower.\n\nWhile Essay B is stronger overall, it has a notable weakness. Its \"Safety, Environment and Ethical Considerations\" section thoroughly addresses safety risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" but completely omits any discussion of environmental impact (e.g., disposal of unused alcohols, ventilation for combustion products) or ethical considerations. For an experimental investigation, this is a clear omission. However, this flaw does not outweigh the significant strengths of its research question, detailed methodology, and comprehensive variable control, making it the superior example of Criterion B exploration.",
