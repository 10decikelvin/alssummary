  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B due to its exceptionally detailed and focused approach across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A is a model of clarity and specificity, stating: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear but lacks the same level of embedded detail regarding variable ranges and measurement parameters.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's exploration is more rigorous. It includes a section on a \"Pre-test,\" which justifies the choice of independent variable values, a key feature of a strong investigation. Its controlled variables are meticulously outlined in a table with columns for \"What,\" \"Why,\" and \"How.\" While Essay B also identifies its variables correctly, Essay A's presentation and justification are more thorough. The safety considerations in Essay A are also more robust, providing a chemical-by-chemical breakdown of hazards, precautions, and emergency actions in a detailed table. Essay B's safety assessment is more general, stating, \"All lab safety equipment was worn at all times...All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard,\" which is adequate but less comprehensive. Although both essays successfully address all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects for their respective experimental investigations, Essay A's depth in its research question, methodology refinement (pre-test), and safety protocols establishes it as the stronger piece of work for Criterion B.",
