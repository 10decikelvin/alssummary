  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and present solid explorations; however, Essay A is superior due to its exceptional clarity, meticulous planning, and thoroughness across all Criterion B elements. Essay A's research question is a model of specificity: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This level of detail immediately establishes a highly focused investigation. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of a pre-test, which justifies the chosen variable range: \"I noticed that the rate of reaction...was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution, due to this I decided to use lower concentrations...to achieve a clearer trend.\" The controlled variables are presented in a clear table detailing what, why, and how each is controlled, and its environmental section shows thoughtful waste minimization based on stoichiometric calculations.\n\nWhile Essay B tackles a more complex kinetic study and demonstrates a strong theoretical background by deriving the integrated rate law, its exploration is slightly less polished. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is clear but lacks the specificity of Essay A's. The methodology, while appropriate, is described with slightly less clarity, and the controlled variables are listed in a paragraph rather than a structured table. Essay B's environmental consideration is also brief, stating only that \"ethyl acetate was flushed down the sink with large quantities of water,\" which contrasts with Essay A's more detailed justification for minimizing waste. Ultimately, Essay A's meticulous and well-documented planning process makes it a stronger example of Criterion B.",
