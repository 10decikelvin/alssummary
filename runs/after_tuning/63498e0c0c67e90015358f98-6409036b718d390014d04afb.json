  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the research question and the handling of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. Essay B's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question specifies the exact range of the independent variable and the precise metrics for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is clear but lacks this high level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background and methodology demonstrate a higher level of personal engagement and critical thinking. The \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section in Essay B explains the rationale for selecting a lux sensor over other methods, showcasing a thoughtful preliminary process. While Essay A's methodology is sound, featuring a well-executed calibration experiment, it lacks this explicit justification of choices. Both essays have strong, well-structured tables for controlled variables.\n\nThe most critical differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Essay B provides a comprehensive section addressing all three. It identifies specific chemical hazards (e.g., \"Potassium bromate(V) (KBrO\u2083) (TOXIC, OXIDISING)\") and details specific disposal methods (\"resulting solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\"). It even discusses waste reduction, showing exceptional environmental awareness. Essay A's safety section is brief and generic (\"could cause skin and nasal irritations\"), and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal.",
