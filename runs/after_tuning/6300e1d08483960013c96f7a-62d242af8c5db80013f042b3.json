  "reasoning": "Essay B is decisively superior to Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction begins with the research question (RQ). Essay B presents an exceptionally focused and detailed RQ: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". This RQ specifies the exact independent variable values and the precise analytical method, demonstrating a high level of planning. In contrast, Essay A's RQ, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear but lacks the same level of operational detail.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is far more advanced and well-considered. It not only outlines a complex and appropriate titration procedure but also includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section that justifies its choice over alternatives like FAAS for safety reasons. Essay A's method is simple but flawed, as its sequential procedure for testing each salt does not properly control for ambient temperature changes over time. Furthermore, Essay B's handling of variables is much more comprehensive, with a table of ten controlled variables, whereas Essay A lists only four.\n\nThe most critical failing of Essay A is the complete omission of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is unacceptable for an experimental investigation. Essay B, conversely, excels in this area. It provides a detailed safety table with specific chemical hazards, stating \"A higher concentration of ammonia solution will cause corrosive injuries... Ammonia buffer is used in the fume cupboard.\" It also correctly addresses ethics by stating, \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved in the experiment,\" and considers environmental impact by planning to \"reduce the tendency of food wastage.\" This thoroughness demonstrates a mature and responsible approach to scientific investigation that is entirely absent in Essay A.",
