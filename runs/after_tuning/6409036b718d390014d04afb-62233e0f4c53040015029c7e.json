  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is superior due to its specificity and detail. It states: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question clearly outlines the independent variable with specific values and uncertainty, the system under study, and the precise methods for measuring the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is vague and lacks the same level of detail regarding the range of variables and measurement outcomes.\n\nSecond, Essay A provides a far more comprehensive and insightful background. It connects the BZ reaction to complex real-world phenomena like cardiac arrhythmia, discusses the underlying redox chemistry, and integrates collision theory with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions to build a strong theoretical foundation for its hypothesis. Essay B's background is much more superficial, offering basic definitions of buffers and presenting the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation without the same depth of exploration or connection to broader concepts.\n\nThird, the methodology in Essay A is logical, well-structured, and shows evidence of personal engagement and preliminary work. The author details the process of selecting the best measurement tool, stating, \"Initially, using a stopwatch... yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately... I found that the built-in lux sensor... could determine the changes in colour\". This demonstrates a thoughtful approach to experimental design. Essay B's methodology is confusingly organized, with the procedural steps listed in a non-chronological order (e.g., step \u2464 appears before step \u2462), making the experiment difficult to follow.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its treatment of controlled variables and safety/environmental considerations. Its table of controlled variables is detailed, providing clear reasons and methods for control. The safety section identifies specific hazards for all relevant chemicals (\"Sulfuric acid is a strong acid... Potassium bromate... toxic if swallowed\") and lists concrete mitigation measures. Crucially, it also addresses environmental impact, noting that \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint\". Essay B's safety section is critically incomplete; it identifies a hazard for acetic acid but fails to provide any mitigation strategies and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation.",
