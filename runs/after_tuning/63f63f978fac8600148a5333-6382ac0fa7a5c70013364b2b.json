  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B due to its sophisticated research question, detailed scientific background, and robust, well-justified methodology.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is exemplary in its clarity and detail: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\" This question precisely defines the independent variable and its range (pH 1.0-5.0), the dependent variable (% removal), and the specific analytical technique. In contrast, Essay B's question is a straightforward comparison: \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources...as determined by two different methodologies...?\" While clear, it lacks the specificity and investigative depth of Essay A's question. Furthermore, Essay A's background provides a thorough chemical foundation, explaining biosorption mechanisms like chelation and the effect of pH on functional groups, citing Le Chatelier's Principle: \"at lower pH values...the position of equilibrium is shifted to the right...favouring the formation of carboxylic acid.\" Essay B's background is largely a personal narrative, offering only the main chemical equations with minimal theoretical explanation.\n\nSecond, the methodology and control of variables in Essay A are far more rigorous. Essay A's student conducted preliminary trials to refine the procedure, identifying and solving problems such as the precipitation of copper hydroxide: \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated...Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation\". This demonstrates a thoughtful and scientific approach to experimental design. Essay B's methodology contains significant flaws; for instance, it repeatedly specifies using a measuring cylinder for titrimetric analysis (\"50 cm\u00b3 of 2.0 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl was added to the 250 cm\u00b3 beaker using a measuring cylinder\"), which introduces unacceptable error for a quantitative technique. Essay A's justification for its controlled variables is also superior, explaining *why* temperature matters on a molecular level: \"Pectin also breaks down at higher temperatures, having a lower availability of binding sites...resulting in an overall lower percentage removal\". Essay B's justifications are generic, such as stating for temperature, \"Varying temperatures can influence the thermal decomposition experiment...\".\n\nFinally, while both essays are experimental and address safety and environmental concerns, Essay A is more complete. Essay A provides specific disposal instructions for its heavy metal waste (\"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\") and explicitly addresses ethical concerns (\"No ethical concerns were raised\"). Essay B also provides a good environmental note (\"dumping them outside may affect soil pH, thereby disrupting the ecosystem\") but omits any mention of ethical considerations. Overall, Essay A presents a meticulously planned, scientifically grounded, and well-justified exploration that is far stronger than the procedurally flawed and theoretically shallow exploration presented in Essay B.",
