  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and will be evaluated as such.\n\nEssay A presents a solid, well-rounded approach to Criterion B. Its research question is clear and specific, stating, \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\" This identifies the independent and dependent variables, the primary reagent concentration, and the methodology. The background information is relevant, explaining gastric acid and neutralization with balanced chemical equations. The methodology is appropriate for the question. Crucially, Essay A addresses all safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. For safety, it states, \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\" For environmental impact, it correctly notes, \"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker, this is because hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes if poured down the drain.\" It also explicitly addresses ethics: \"There are no ethical considerations for this experiment.\" A minor weakness is the muddled identification of the independent variable, initially listing \"Mass of indigestion tablets\" before later justifying why mass isn't controlled.\n\nEssay B demonstrates higher-level thinking in several areas but suffers from critical omissions. Its research question is exceptionally well-formulated: \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid measured in moldm-3 using acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\" The background information is detailed and shows a strong link to personal engagement. The variables section is excellent, presenting controlled variables in a clear table with robust justifications. However, Essay B's treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations is a major flaw. The safety section is minimal, only stating, \"Gloves are not necessary... due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH.\" This overlooks standard lab practices like wearing goggles. More importantly, there is a complete omission of both environmental and ethical considerations, which is a significant failure for an experimental investigation.\n\nIn comparison, while Essay B has a more sophisticated variable table and background, Essay A is the superior submission because it completely fulfills all the requirements of Criterion B. The failure of Essay B to address environmental and ethical concerns, coupled with its weak safety section, is a fundamental flaw. Essay A, by contrast, provides a competent and complete exploration that meets all specified criteria, making it the better essay.",
