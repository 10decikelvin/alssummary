  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B due to its stronger foundational research design, clearer understanding of experimental variables, and more thorough consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact range of the independent variable and the precise measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay B's research question is much broader and less focused.\n\nThe most significant weakness in Essay B is its fundamental misunderstanding of variables. It incorrectly identifies the \"Independent\" variable as the \"Mass of sample before titrating\" and \"Mass of sample before heating,\" when the initial mass is clearly a controlled variable; the true independent variable is the source of the calcium carbonate (chalk, seashell, or rangoli). This conceptual error undermines the entire experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology contains a critical flaw: it specifies using a \"Measuring Cylinder (\u00b10.25 cm\u00b3)\" to measure 25 cm\u00b3 of solution for titration, a task that requires a pipette for accuracy and is a significant procedural error.\n\nEssay A, on the other hand, correctly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, providing clear and practical methods for controlling them, such as how the \"distance between the electrodes\" will be maintained. Essay A also excels in its risk assessment, providing distinct, detailed sections for safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Its environmental section is particularly strong, discussing specific disposal methods for copper sulphate and sulphuric acid. Essay B addresses safety well but provides only a brief environmental note (\"dumping them outside may affect soil pH\") and completely omits the required ethical considerations section. While both essays present experimental work, Essay A's meticulous design, correct application of scientific principles, and comprehensive approach to Criterion B make it the better submission.",
