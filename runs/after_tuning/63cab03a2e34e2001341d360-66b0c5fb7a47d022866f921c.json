  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more rigorous and well-structured approach to experimental design, particularly in its research question and treatment of variables.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is more focused and scientifically sound than Essay A's. Essay B investigates a continuous, precisely controlled independent variable (volumetric concentration), whereas Essay A's IV, \"source of water, depending on their pollution level,\" is categorical and based on qualitative secondary research, making it less controlled.\n\nSecond, Essay B's handling of variables is exemplary and far surpasses Essay A's. Essay B presents its controlled variables in a detailed table with columns for \"Why this variable is being controlled\" and \"How this variable is being controlled,\" demonstrating a deep understanding of experimental design. For instance, for the source of E10, it explains the need for control (\"E10 fuel in Australia contains anywhere from 9-10% ethanol\") and how it will be managed (\"By purchasing all of the E10 (500ml) off of the same gas station\"). Essay A simply lists its \"Constants\" without such justification. Furthermore, Essay B provides a strong rationale for its chosen range of independent variables, linking them to real-world applications like E10 and E85.\n\nThird, while both essays are experimental and have appropriate methodologies, Essay B is more complete in its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Essay A provides a very strong, detailed list of chemical-specific risks (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer\"), but it omits any mention of ethical considerations. Essay B explicitly addresses all three components, stating for ethics, \"No ethical considerations were considered,\" and for the environment, \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company,\" which is a specific and responsible plan.\n\nIn summary, while Essay A presents a competent investigation with a good methodology, Essay B's precision in its research question, exceptional control of variables, and comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B components make it the stronger submission.",
