  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations and the measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is less precise and lacks the same level of detail.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is highly focused and directly supports the experimental design, explaining concepts like the Beer-Lambert law and the chemistry of bleaching, justifying the use of a spectrophotometer. Essay A also commendably includes a detailed pre-test section to determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach via titration, showing excellent scientific foresight. Essay B's background is adequate but less focused, with extensive discussion on Gibbs free energy which, while related, is not central to the investigation's core aim of linking concentration and enthalpy.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is far more rigorous. It investigates five different concentrations, providing a sufficient range to establish a clear trend. Essay B's methodology, while appropriate in principle, is weak because it only examines two concentrations (\"0.5M & 1.0M\"), which is insufficient for a meaningful investigation of how the variable affects the outcome. Furthermore, Essay A's handling of variables is exemplary, with a detailed table explaining the significance of each controlled variable. Essay B's table is much less detailed.\n\nFinally, Essay A demonstrates a much stronger commitment to safety and environmental considerations. It includes a detailed table outlining chemical hazards and specific emergency actions. Its environmental plan is responsible, stating that hazardous chemicals \"were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay B's safety precautions are minimal (\"wore gloves and laboratory glasses\"), and its environmental plan is contradictory and concerning, stating \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\" while also claiming \"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways.\" Though Essay A omits an explicit mention of ethical considerations, its overall quality in every other area makes it the clear winner.",
