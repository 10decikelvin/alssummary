  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it demonstrates a much stronger command of the core scientific principles of experimental design, which are central to Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is highly specific, detailing the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (BOD), timescale, and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail. A critical flaw in Essay B is the misidentification of its dependent variable as \"the temperature difference after heating the solution,\" when the actual dependent variable is the specific heat capacity calculated from that temperature difference. Essay A correctly identifies its dependent variable: \"BOD of the water sample at different pH values.\" Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed and well-controlled, and its background information thoroughly explains both the concept of BOD and the complex chemistry of the Winkler method. While Essay B is stronger in its safety, ethical, and environmental section\u2014explicitly addressing all three, for instance stating \"there were no ethical precautions needed\"\u2014Essay A's omission of ethical considerations is a smaller flaw compared to Essay B's fundamental error in variable identification. The scientific rigor demonstrated in Essay A's research question, variable identification, and methodology makes it the better submission.",
