  "reasoning": "While both submissions demonstrate a solid understanding of experimental design, Essay B is superior due to its clearer structure, more robust methodology, and more thorough consideration of safety and environmental factors. \n\nEssay A presents an interesting investigation but fundamentally misidentifies the independent and dependent variables, stating 'Dependent: Different types of substances' and 'Independent: Temperature change'. This indicates a misunderstanding of experimental design. While it includes safety precautions, it only briefly touches upon waste disposal and omits environmental impact discussion. \n\nIn contrast, Essay B has a very clear and focused research question: 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?'. The methodology is appropriate, and although variables are not explicitly listed in a separate section, they are correctly implied in the research question. Crucially, the 'SAFETY, ETHICS AND ENVIRONMENT' section is exemplary. It specifically addresses personal protective equipment ('worn at all times'), handling of hot equipment, and explicitly notes the environmental impact: 'Paraffin wax is not biodegradable, and its residue after it burns emits toxic fumes that can create air pollution.' It also correctly identifies that there are no ethical issues. This level of detail and correctness in the experimental design sections makes it the stronger submission.",
