  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental plans. Essay A has a very clear and focused research question: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...?\". It provides specific, testable values for its independent variable. Essay B's question, while valid, is slightly broader: \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\". Both provide excellent background information and detailed methodologies. However, Essay A's methodology is slightly superior because it includes a quantitative justification for the concentration of the titrant used: \"Moles of 0.0100 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of KMnO\u2084=0.0100 \u00d7 (50/1000) = 5.00 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074...is in excess compared to the moles required...\". It also features a more detailed and self-critical evaluation of weaknesses, distinguishing between random and systematic errors and suggesting specific, practical improvements like using a colorimeter. While Essay B's inclusion of uncontrolled variables is good, Essay A's overall experimental design, justification, and evaluation show a slightly higher level of scientific engagement and foresight.",
