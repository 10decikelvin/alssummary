  "reasoning": "While both submissions demonstrate a good understanding of the scientific method, Essay B is superior due to its clarity, consistency, and more thorough evaluation. Essay A's research question is confusing, stating it will use 'secondary data' while the methodology describes a primary experiment using the Winkler titration method. This is a significant contradiction. In contrast, Essay B presents a clear, focused research question: \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion...?\" The methodology provided, though incomplete, aligns directly with this question. Furthermore, Essay B's section on Safety, Ethical, and Environmental considerations is exemplary. It specifically addresses each point, correctly identifying that there are 'no ethical considerations' and providing thoughtful comments on both safety (burns, fumes) and environmental impact (disposal of paraffin wax). Essay A's safety section is also good, but it completely omits any mention of ethics and its environmental consideration is generic. Finally, Essay B's evaluation of limitations is presented in a highly organized table that clearly distinguishes between the source of error, its type, its effect on the results, and potential improvements, demonstrating a more sophisticated level of analysis than Essay A.",
