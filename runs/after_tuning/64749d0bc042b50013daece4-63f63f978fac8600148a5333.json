  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B. Essay A presents a well-structured investigation into a classic environmental chemistry topic. Its research question, \"How does varying salinity... and temperature... affect the amount of dissolved oxygen... measured through Winkler\u2019s titration?\", is commendably specific, detailing both independent variables' ranges and the precise measurement technique. The background information is thorough, explaining the scientific principles behind the hypothesis and justifying the choice of the Winkler method over alternatives. The variables are comprehensively identified and controlled, with excellent justifications such as controlling \"Exposure to atmospheric oxygen/air\" by introducing solutions \"under the surface of the solution\". The safety section is particularly strong, using a clear table to outline specific hazards and disposal methods for each chemical.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of personal engagement and scientific exploration. Its research question, \"How does varying pH... under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is equally focused and detailed. The rationale is exceptionally well-developed, not only connecting to the real-world problem of heavy metal pollution but also providing a sophisticated scientific justification for choosing an acidic pH range, specifically noting that \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4\". Crucially, Essay B includes a section on \"Preliminary Trials,\" which documents how the methodology was refined in response to challenges like precipitation at pH 6.0 and determining the optimal contact time. This demonstrates a more authentic and iterative scientific process than simply following a standard procedure. While its safety section is less detailed in format than Essay A's, its environmental consideration regarding the disposal of heavy metals is more specific and robust (\"disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\"). The overall narrative of exploration\u2014identifying a niche, troubleshooting problems, and refining the method\u2014makes Essay B slightly stronger.",
