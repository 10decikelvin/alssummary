  "reasoning": "While both essays present competent investigations, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and thoroughness, making it the superior example for Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally focused, detailing the exact concentrations to be tested and the specific measurement technique. Essay B's question is also good, but less specific. The key differentiator is Essay A's methodology, which includes a dedicated \"Pre-Test\" section. This preliminary work, where the student determined the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach via titration and established the optimal wavelength for the spectrophotometer (628.1nm), shows outstanding planning and a deep engagement with the experimental design process.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's methodology is sound but more straightforward. The background information in Essay A is also more detailed, explaining the Beer-Lambert law and even calculating the molar absorptivity value (\"\u03b5=highest absorbance value measured / path length \u00d7 calculated concentration value of blue food dye\"), which demonstrates a stronger grasp of the underlying theory. Finally, Essay A's handling of environmental concerns is more specific and appropriate, stating that hazardous chemicals \"were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay B's statement that waste was \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\" is less precise and potentially less safe for some of the listed chemicals. Although both essays lack an explicit mention of ethical considerations, Essay A's methodological thoroughness and deeper scientific context make it the stronger piece of work.",
