  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more robust and detailed exploration than Essay B.\n\nBoth essays formulate clear and focused research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", which is specific and sets up a well-defined experiment. Essay B's research questions, \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\" and \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its boiling point?\", are also clear but lead to a data-based investigation rather than a hands-on experiment.\n\nThe primary strength of Essay A lies in its methodology. It is an experimental investigation with a detailed, step-by-step procedure for both solution preparation and the main experiment. The variables are clearly identified and controlled, as seen in the table: \"Independent variable: 1. Type of acid... 2. Temperature,\" \"Dependent variable: Rate at which the yellow colour turns colourless,\" and \"Controlled variables: ...Concentration of propanone, iodine solution... Total volume...\". Crucially, it includes specific and relevant safety and environmental considerations appropriate for a lab-based study, such as noting \"iodopropanone is a lachrymator so it should be placed in the fume cupboard\" and detailing waste disposal: \"iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste and the propanone solution should be disposed of in the organic waste.\"\n\nEssay B, while well-structured, is a data-based study. Its methodology section is appropriate for this type of investigation, identifying its sources as \"ChemPub and Chemeo\" and outlining how the data will be processed. However, it lacks the complexity and personal engagement demonstrated in designing and planning an actual experiment. Because it is a data-based study, the absence of safety and environmental protocols is understandable, but Essay A's inclusion of these elements demonstrates a more comprehensive approach to the scientific process.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's post-experimental evaluation section critically reflects on its own methodology, identifying potential sources of error such as \"relying on the naked eye\" for color change and the \"large uncertainty\" from using burettes for small volumes. This self-evaluation shows a deeper level of engagement and understanding of experimental design, which is a key component of Criterion B. While Essay B's background is well-written and connects to a real-world issue, Essay A's detailed experimental plan makes it the superior submission for this criterion.",
