  "reasoning": "The decision is that 'essay_a' is better. Essay A is built on a stronger foundation, starting with a well-defined and focused research question: `INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION ON THE ENTHALPY CHANGE OF THE REDOX REACTION BETWEEN A FIXED MASS OF ZINC AND COPPER (II) SULPHATE SOLUTION.`. This clarity is maintained through the background section, which provides highly relevant theoretical chemistry, including calculations of `E\u00b0cell` and Gibbs free energy to establish the reaction's spontaneity. In contrast, Essay B's research question is confusing and contradictory, asking how dissolved oxygen changes `by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?`. The mix of a secondary data approach and a primary experimental method in the RQ creates a lack of focus.\n\nWhile Essay B features an impressively detailed methodology and a superior safety assessment that lists specific hazards for each chemical (e.g., `Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer. Do not consume or inhale vapors`), it has a critical omission: it fails to address ethical considerations at all. Essay A, although its safety section is more general (`I also wore gloves and laboratory glasses`), correctly addresses all three required components, explicitly stating `I took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions.` This demonstrates a complete awareness of the criteria.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's variables are clearly tabulated and justified, and the methodology is appropriate and easy to follow. Although Essay B's methodology is more detailed, the fundamental strength of Essay A lies in its coherent structure from RQ to conclusion. The flawed research question and the incomplete treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations in Essay B are significant weaknesses that outweigh its strengths in methodological detail. Therefore, Essay A represents a better overall fulfillment of Criterion B.",
