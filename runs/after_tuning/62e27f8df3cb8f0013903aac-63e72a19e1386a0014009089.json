  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong research questions and detailed background information. Essay A's research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC)...\", is highly specific, outlining variables, concentrations, and the analytical method. Essay B's question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt... affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm...\", is similarly focused and well-defined. Both provide thorough, relevant background theory. However, Essay A excels in its experimental design and justification, explicitly stating, \"Before finalising the procedure...different procedures were researched and tested through preliminary testing,\" which led to modifications like using a hotplate instead of a water bath and choosing a maximum temperature of 60\u00b0C. This demonstrates a more thoughtful and refined scientific process. The most significant difference lies in the consideration of safety and environmental impacts. Essay A includes a detailed table outlining the hazards of each chemical (\"Pure Propanone...Highly flammable,\" \"Sulfuric acid...Causes severe skin burns\") and provides specific mitigation and disposal instructions (\"Dispose according to local legislation. Neutralise with lime or soda ash\"). In contrast, Essay B's \"SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\" section is an empty table template, completely failing to address the risks and disposal of chemicals like manganese sulphate and concentrated sulphuric acid. This is a major omission for an experimental investigation. Therefore, due to its more thoroughly justified methodology and comprehensive safety and environmental assessment, Essay A is the superior submission.",
