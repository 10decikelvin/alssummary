  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B as it presents a more methodologically sound and complete exploration. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally well-formulated research question: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\". This question is highly specific, including the exact temperatures to be tested, the substances, and the quantitative method, which sets a clear and focused direction for the investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question is framed as a statement of intent: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\". While clear, it lacks the specificity and evaluative depth of Essay A's question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a critical component of Criterion B for an experimental investigation. It specifically addresses safety with mentions of using \"tongs to prevent skin burns\" and wearing PPE for handling iodine. It also includes thoughtful ethical (\"minimize the waste of such products\") and environmental (\"powered off and unplugged [the heating plate] when it was not used\") considerations. Essay B provides adequate safety precautions, such as to \"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane,\" but it critically omits any mention of ethical or environmental issues. The failure to address the proper disposal of dichloromethane, a hazardous chlorinated solvent, is a major flaw in its experimental design.\n\nWhile both essays present appropriate methodologies and correctly identify their variables, Essay A's background information is more directly linked to the chemical principles of its method, explaining the redox reaction central to the titration. Essay B's background is more general. Ultimately, Essay A's combination of a superior research question and a complete, responsible approach to all aspects of experimental design, particularly the safety, ethical, and environmental sections, makes it the stronger piece of work.",
