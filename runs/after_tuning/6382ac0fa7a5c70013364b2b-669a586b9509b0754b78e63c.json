  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its meticulously crafted research question: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3)...?\". This question is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, specifying exact quantities and the precise range of the independent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...?\" is clear but lacks the same level of scientific specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is more scientifically rigorous, grounding the investigation in relevant theory like collision theory to predict outcomes. Essay B states, \"increasing the concentration of HCl increases the number of HCl molecules within a given volume; this leads to an increased number of collisions... an increase in rate of reaction.\" Essay A's background is more narrative-driven and lacks this theoretical depth. Essay B also excels in its identification and control of variables, presenting a detailed table explaining not just what is controlled, but specifically why and how. Essay A's variable table is weaker and incorrectly identifies the independent variable as \"Mass of sample,\" when it should be the different sources of calcium carbonate.\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a comprehensive and exemplary treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It presents a detailed safety table for each chemical and explicitly addresses the other two aspects, stating, \"This experiment has no ethical considerations\" and detailing a specific, justified disposal plan for waste HCl. Essay A has a good safety section and mentions environmental disposal (\"The excess HCl and sample solution were properly disposed of within the lab itself... may affect soil pH\"), but it completely omits any discussion of ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw in an experimental IA. The inclusion of a pre-test section in Essay B further highlights a more thorough and well-planned scientific exploration compared to Essay A.",
