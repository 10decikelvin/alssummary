  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across several key aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirstly, Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-formulated and detailed: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This is a model research question, as it precisely specifies the concentrations, catalyst, independent variable with its exact range, and the dependent variable with its method of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", while clear, lacks this high level of specificity regarding the range of the independent variable.\n\nSecondly, Essay A presents a more rigorous and refined methodology. A critical strength is the inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies the chosen temperature range (\"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick... so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme\") and procedural modifications (\"the caps of cuvettes were not placed during the experiment as from the preliminary trials, there was not enough time\"). This demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design. Essay B's methodology is appropriate, but it lacks this justification for its choices, such as why \"6 drops of HCl\" were used to alter the pH.\n\nThirdly, while both essays identify variables and safety precautions well, Essay A is far more thorough in its environmental considerations. Essay A's safety table details disposal for each chemical, stating \"Do not wash down the sink as it is hazardous to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay B, on the other hand, provides a single, vague statement: \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory, hence abiding by environmental considerations of disposal.\" This lacks the specificity and sense of responsibility shown in Essay A.\n\nFinally, the background information in both is relevant, but Essay A's detailed explanation of the Arrhenius equation and its graphical application directly supports the complex data processing required by its RQ, showing a deeper integration of theory and practice. Although Essay B is a competent investigation, Essay A's precision, methodological refinement through preliminary work, and superior handling of environmental concerns make it the stronger piece.",
