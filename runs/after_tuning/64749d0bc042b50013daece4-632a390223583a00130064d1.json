  "reasoning": "Both essays present exceptionally strong Criterion B sections, making the decision very close. Essay A's research question is exemplary in its detail: \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\". It clearly outlines two independent variables with specific ranges, the dependent variable with units, and the precise methodology. Essay B also has a very clear and focused research question: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". Both essays provide relevant, detailed background information and a thoroughly described methodology appropriate to their respective questions. However, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of critical thought regarding the experimental design. This is most evident in its identification of variables; in addition to a comprehensive list of controlled variables, Essay B explicitly discusses \"Uncontrolled Variables\" like the \"Uniform Depth of Sample\" and the \"Rate of Water Evaporation from Plastic,\" which shows a deeper level of reflection on the limitations of its procedure. Furthermore, Essay B's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is more nuanced. While both are experimental and address these points, Essay B offers a more thoughtful ethical consideration, stating, \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted... We must be conscious of the materials used.\" This contrasts with Essay A's correct but brief dismissal (\"No pertinent ethical considerations for this experiment exist.\"). For these reasons, Essay B is marginally superior.",
