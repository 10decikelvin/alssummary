  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of detail, focus, and scientific rigor across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is exceptionally strong, being both focused and highly detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This specificity contrasts sharply with Essay B's vague question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", which lacks defined variables, ranges, or salts. Essay A's background information is also far superior; it provides relevant chemical theory like the Photo-Fenton reaction and the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2,\" which directly justifies the chosen concentration range. Essay B's background is superficial, offering little more than a definition of solubility.\n\nSecond, the methodology and variable control in Essay A are exemplary. The procedure is meticulously detailed, including specific concentrations and volumes, and is refined by \"Preliminary Trials\" which demonstrate personal engagement and optimization. Essay A's controlled variables are presented in a comprehensive table, explaining not only *what* was controlled (e.g., \"Surface area of reactants exposed to UV-light\") but also *why* and *how*. In contrast, Essay B's methodology is generic, lacking key quantities, and its identification of variables is weak and confusing, with a minimal list of controlled variables like \"Boiling temperature\".\n\nFinally, Essay A properly addresses procedural considerations for its experimental design. It includes specific safety measures (\"googles were worn when the UV-Lamp was in operation\") and, crucially, environmental considerations (\"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\"). Essay B provides only a generic safety note and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation. The combination of a highly focused research question, a deeply researched background, and a robust, well-controlled methodology makes Essay A the clear winner.",
