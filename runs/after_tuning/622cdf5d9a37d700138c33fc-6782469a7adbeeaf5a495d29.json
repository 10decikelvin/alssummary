  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it excels in nearly every aspect of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the quality of the research question and the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B's research question is exemplary in its precision and clarity: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This is a focused, detailed, and measurable question. In contrast, Essay A's research question is a statement of intent rather than a question and lacks specificity: \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction...\".\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is more scientifically rigorous, clearly identifying a specific research gap: \"There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts.\" While both methodologies are detailed, Essay B's is enhanced by the inclusion and discussion of \"Preliminary Trials\", which were used to refine the procedure\u2014a hallmark of a thoughtful and well-planned investigation.\n\nMost critically, Essay B properly addresses the required safety and environmental aspects for an experimental investigation. It notes specific safety precautions like wearing gloves \"to prevent chemical burns and exposure to carcinogens\" and explicitly addresses environmental impact: \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC.\" Essay A's treatment is far weaker, with a minimal \"Risk Assessment\" section and a complete omission of any ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw. While both essays do an excellent job identifying and controlling variables, Essay B's stronger foundational elements and thoroughness in all required sections make it the better piece of work.",
