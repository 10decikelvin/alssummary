  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more comprehensive and meticulously detailed approach to Criterion B. The primary differentiator is its thorough and explicit handling of all required components, particularly its research question and safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nEssay B's research question is exceptionally strong: \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity...\". This is highly specific, embedding the exact values of the independent variable directly into the question, which demonstrates a high level of focus from the outset. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility...\", is clear but less detailed, requiring the reader to look elsewhere for the specific range of concentrations. Furthermore, Essay B's \"Risk Assessment\" section is exemplary; it explicitly addresses safety (\"Use of personal protective equipment\"), ethical (\"It is believed that no ethical considerations were present in this experiment.\"), and environmental considerations (\"NaOH is a corrosive chemical that can harm aquatic life...but the majority of it is neutralised...\").\n\nEssay A presents a solid experimental plan with a relevant background and well-controlled variables, such as controlling temperature because \"Solubility increases with increase in temperature\". Its methodology is appropriate for answering its research question. However, it has a significant omission. While it addresses safety (\"Lab coat and gloves were worn\"), it completely fails to mention or address any ethical or environmental considerations. For an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal, this is a critical flaw.\n\nUltimately, while Essay A describes a competent investigation, Essay B's superior, highly-specific research question and its complete fulfillment of all safety, ethical, and environmental requirements make it the better essay according to the specified criteria.",
