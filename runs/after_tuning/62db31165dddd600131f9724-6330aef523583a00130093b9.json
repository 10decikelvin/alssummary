  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better because it presents a complete, albeit flawed, scientific exploration, whereas Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay A provides a solid introduction and relevant background, explaining the chemistry of ascorbic acid titration effectively. It states, \"Once all ascorbic acid has been oxidized, an excess of iodine...will react with the amylose...in the starch indicator...causing the solution to turn a dark blue colour.\" However, its exploration ends there; the essay completely lacks a methodology, a populated variables table, and any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. These omissions represent a fundamental failure to meet the requirements of Criterion B.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B outlines a full investigation. Its research question is complex and specific, aiming to determine if it is \"possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions: \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc54+, \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\u2212, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59 \u2212 and \ud835\udc3c \u2212 from enthalpy changes of precipitation reaction...\". It provides a detailed, repeatable methodology with a full apparatus list including uncertainties (`AgNO\u2083 (solid) 0.85g (\u00b10.01g) x 9`) and a clear, step-by-step procedure. Furthermore, Essay B includes a dedicated \"Experimental safety precautions\" section with specific advice, such as \"Silver nitrate should be stored in sealed containers or packages and not exposed to light.\" While Essay B incorrectly identifies its independent and dependent variables, this error is minor compared to Essay A's complete absence of an experimental plan. Ultimately, Essay B provides all the necessary components for a full exploration, making it far superior to the introductory fragment presented in Essay A.",
