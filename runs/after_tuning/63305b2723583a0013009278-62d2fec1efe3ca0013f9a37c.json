  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and clear investigations. Essay B, however, demonstrates a slightly stronger grasp of experimental design and theoretical underpinning. Its research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused and requires a more complex multi-step experimental procedure involving varying temperature to calculate a derived quantity (activation energy). The background information effectively explains the Arrhenius equation and its graphical application, which is central to the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", while specific, explores a more direct relationship. Essay A's methodology is sound, but its handling of temperature as a controlled variable (\"remained relatively constant = 22.3 \u00b10.1 \u00b0C\") is less rigorous than Essay B's plan to intentionally vary and measure it. Both essays provide good safety and environmental considerations, but Essay B's specific mention of disposing of organic and inorganic waste separately shows a slightly deeper awareness of lab procedures. Therefore, due to the more sophisticated experimental design and clearer link between theory and method, Essay B is judged to be superior.",
