  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific inquiry and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B. The foundation of an excellent investigation is its research question, and Essay B's is far superior. It poses an evaluative question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\". This framing invites a critical assessment of a methodology, which is a more sophisticated approach than Essay A's descriptive question: \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change...?\".\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background is exemplary. It provides extensive, relevant context by linking the investigation to real-world issues like \"global warming\" and \"the Paris Agreement,\" and then delves deep into the complex chemistry of dissolved oxygen and the various methods for measuring it, including the detailed mechanism of the Winkler method. This provides a robust justification for the research question. In contrast, Essay A's background is adequate but disjointed, covering the definition of enthalpy and the feasibility of the reaction without building a compelling narrative.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are appropriate, but Essay B again shows greater depth. Its procedure is meticulously detailed, and the inclusion of findings from \"preliminary trials\" indicates a more thoughtful and iterative experimental design process. Finally, Essay B's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is far more specific and professional. It lists specific hazards for each chemical, such as \"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive,\" and provides concrete environmental disposal instructions: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting...\". Essay A's safety section is generic (\"wore gloves and laboratory glasses when carrying out the experiment\") and its environmental section, while present, suggests a questionable disposal method (\"disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\"). Overall, Essay B displays a comprehensive and critical approach that is a hallmark of a high-achieving exploration.",
