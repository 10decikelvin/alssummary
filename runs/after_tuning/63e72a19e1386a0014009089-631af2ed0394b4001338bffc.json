  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental plans. Essay A's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt... affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration,\" is commendably precise, specifying the exact concentrations and uncertainties. Its methodology and handling of variables are clear and appropriate. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior depth of understanding and a more thorough approach overall. Essay B's background information provides a more sophisticated scientific context, explaining complex concepts like \"calcium-phosphate bonding in casein micelles\" and the equilibrium between free and bound ions. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology section is enhanced by its excellent treatment of variables, including a dedicated table for \"Uncontrolled variables,\" which shows a higher level of critical thinking about the experimental design. Essay B also provides a more complete risk assessment, explicitly addressing safety (\"Use of corrosive substances\"), environmental (\"toxic to the aquatic life\"), and ethical considerations (\"No ethical concerns were identified\"), whereas Essay A omits any mention of ethics. While both essays are very well-structured, Essay B's more detailed scientific background and more comprehensive evaluation of experimental design make it the stronger piece of work.",
