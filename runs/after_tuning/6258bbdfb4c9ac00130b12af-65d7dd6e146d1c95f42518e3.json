  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a research question, but Essay A's is clearer and more focused: 'What is the effect of changing the temperature of the oil on the amount of titrant required to reach the end-point?'  While this implies a relationship, it could be more precise about what the titrant indicates (like acidity). Essay B's question, 'How do varying temperatures...affect the buffer capacity of pH-balancing facial cleansers...', is well-defined and includes the range of the independent variable. Both essays provide relevant background information, explaining concepts like rancidity, saponification value (Essay A), and buffer capacity (Essay B). \n\nMethodologically, both outline a titration procedure. However, Essay B's procedure for investigating buffer capacity is more sound and directly addresses the research question. The titration method described in Essay A to determine 'saponification value' is scientifically flawed; saponification is a slow process and cannot be accurately measured through direct titration. A back titration would be the standard method. This is a significant flaw in the experimental design of Essay A.\n\nRegarding safety and ethics, both essays are strong. Essay A correctly identifies risks like handling corrosive chemicals (HCl, NaOH) and flammability (ethanol), suggesting specific safety measures like 'wear gloves and goggles' and 'keep flammable liquids away from fire'. It also briefly addresses environmental concerns by stating chemicals were disposed of according to lab guidelines. Similarly, Essay B identifies hazards like corrosive HCl and hot plates, recommending 'appropriate PPE' and handling hot glassware with 'tongs'.\n\nOverall, while both have their strengths, the fundamental methodological flaw in Essay A (using a direct titration for saponification) makes it less scientifically viable than Essay B. Therefore, despite both having good structure and safety considerations, Essay B is superior.",
