  "reasoning": "Essay A is better because it demonstrates a more sophisticated and thoroughly planned scientific exploration. Its two-part research question is a key strength, being both clear and highly detailed: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol on the enthalpy change of combustion...\". This specificity sets a strong foundation that Essay B lacks. Essay A's control of variables is also superior, particularly the identification and justification for controlling the \"Molar mass of Alcohol Isomers,\" which is crucial for validly addressing the second part of its research question.\n\nEssay B presents a viable investigation, with a clear research question: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea... using dichloromethane\". The methodology is appropriate, and the variables are well-identified. The safety section is also commendable for its specific warnings about dichloromethane, such as to \"Wear a mask for protection because dichloromethane causes several health issues if inhaled\". However, its research question is fundamentally a simple comparison, lacking the analytical depth of Essay A's investigation into a functional relationship.\n\nCrucially, both essays fail to explicitly address ethical and environmental considerations. This is a significant omission for experimental investigations. However, the flaw is more pronounced in Essay B. Its own background information identifies dichloromethane as a chemical that \"has a high probability of being carcinogenic to humans,\" making the lack of any discussion on proper disposal or environmental impact a more serious oversight than in Essay A, where the combustion products are less hazardous. Ultimately, Essay A's more ambitious research question, coupled with a more rigorous and insightful approach to controlling variables, makes it the stronger example of Criterion B, despite its own omissions.",
