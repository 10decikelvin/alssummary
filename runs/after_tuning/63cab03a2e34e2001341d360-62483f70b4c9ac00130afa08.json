  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across most elements of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\". This question is focused, specific, and contains clear evaluative language (\"To what extent... a good way\"), which frames a sophisticated investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\", is confusing and contains a critical contradiction, claiming to compare \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary experimental investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section is highly relevant and directly supports its research question. It not only explains the chemical principles behind the effect of temperature on dissolved oxygen (citing Le Chatelier's Principle) but also critically compares different measurement techniques, which is essential context for an investigation evaluating the Winkler method. While Essay A's background is adequate, it is less focused and provides less chemical depth. Both essays present a detailed and appropriate experimental methodology; however, Essay B includes valuable insights from preliminary trials, stating, \"During preliminary trials I found that when collecting the sample of water from the tap, the water stream should be slow and constant as not to aerate the water,\" which demonstrates a more thorough exploration process.\n\nFinally, Essay B is superior in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It explicitly addresses all three aspects, providing specific instructions for environmental disposal: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\". It also correctly states, \"There are no major ethical issues surrounding the investigation\". Essay A has a strong risk assessment but completely omits any mention of ethics and offers only a generic environmental statement: \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals\". This omission, combined with its weaker research question, makes it the weaker essay.",
