  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a higher level of proficiency in Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally clear and focused, specifying the exact temperatures to be tested: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg)...\". In contrast, Essay B's research question, while good, is less specific, referring only to \"the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride\" without defining the range or increments.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology and planning are more robust. It includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section that justifies the choice of complexometric titration over other methods like FAAS, showing critical thinking. The variables section in Essay A is significantly more detailed; for example, the table of controlled variables lists nine specific factors, each with a method for control and a detailed justification, such as, \"The time taken for the raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond heated... The calcium content in the milk will be leached out as the milk is heated for a longer period.\" Essay B's controlled variables are more generic, with brief justifications like, \"Changing of Concentrations and volumes for each sample would make the results unreliable\".\n\nBoth essays provide good safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B has a slightly stronger environmental consideration by explicitly mentioning the neutralization of acids for disposal. However, Essay A's overall depth in its research question, methodology, and control of variables makes it the superior submission. The extensive \"Limitations\" table in Essay A, which identifies potential random and systematic errors and suggests specific improvements, further highlights its thoroughness and advanced level of planning.",
