  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's is stronger due to its inclusion of an additional independent variable (type of alcohol). Essay A's RQ is \"How does the concentration of NaCl solution... affect the rate of transpiration...\", while Essay B's is \"How do varying concentrations of salt (NaCl) solution... affect the rate of transpiration... AND how is the transpiration rate of different plant species affected by varying salt concentrations?\" This added layer of inquiry demonstrates a higher level of complexity and curiosity. \n\nHowever, both essays suffer from a lack of clarity in their methodologies. Neither essay specifies the exact concentration levels of salt solution to be tested, which is a critical detail for replication and understanding the scope of the investigation. \n\nIn terms of safety considerations, both essays are comparable. Both mention wearing gloves and goggles, and both address the disposal of solutions. \n\nDespite the vagueness in its methodology, Essay B is slightly better. The more complex research question demonstrates a deeper level of scientific inquiry. Additionally, its hypothesis is more specific and testable than Essay A's, which states a general aim rather than a specific prediction. For these reasons, Essay B shows a slightly higher level of scientific engagement.",
