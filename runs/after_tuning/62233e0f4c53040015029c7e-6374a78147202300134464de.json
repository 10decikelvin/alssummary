  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better as it provides a more thorough and well-structured exploration, particularly in its background research and fulfillment of all formal requirements for Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is exceptionally clear and specific, defining the scope of the investigation from the outset. Its background section is a major strength, going beyond simple definitions to calculate the cell potential and Gibbs free energy to prove the reaction's feasibility, which demonstrates a high level of chemical understanding. Furthermore, under its \"RISK ASSESSMENT\" section, Essay B correctly addresses all three required considerations: safety (\"wore gloves and laboratory glasses\"), environmental (\"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways as they are hazardous\"), and ethical (\"I took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay A has several significant weaknesses. While its research question is acceptable, its methodology section is chaotically organized with non-sequential numbering (e.g., \"\u2460 Prepare NaCH\u2083COO\", followed by \"\u2464 Set up the burette\", then \"\u2465 Heat up the buffer solution\"), making the experimental plan very difficult to follow. More critically, Essay A fails to adequately address the safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Its \"Safety section\" is incomplete, mentioning only Acetic Acid and cutting off the minimization strategy, while completely omitting any mention of Sodium Hydroxide. There is no mention of ethical or environmental considerations at all, which is a major omission for an experimental investigation. While Essay A does investigate a better range of its independent variable (five temperatures vs. Essay B's two concentrations), Essay B's superior research question, deeper background information, clearer methodology, and complete S/E/E section make it the stronger piece of work.",
