  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior because it presents a complete and well-structured exploration that addresses all required components of Criterion B, whereas Essay B is critically incomplete. Essay A's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen...when temperature is kept constant?\", is clear, focused, and testable. This is supported by a robust background section that not only defines dissolved oxygen but also provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the chemical principles behind the Winkler Method, including the relevant equations. Furthermore, Essay A clearly identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a table with justifications, demonstrating a strong understanding of experimental design.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B has a strong research question that includes evaluative language (\"how significant is the variation in calcium content...depending on the expiration date?\"), the provided text is missing fundamental sections. There is no background information to establish the scientific context for complexometric titration or calcium in milk. Crucially, there is no variables section, which is a major omission in experimental design. Although Essay B's risk assessment is specific, mentioning that \"EDTA, Eriochrome Black T, Ethanol, and Ammonia Buffer... are very corrosive,\" Essay A's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects is more comprehensive. Essay A explicitly states, \"No animal or human being was harmed,\" and provides a specific disposal plan: \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation.\" Because Essay A provides a complete investigation from research question through to methodology and safety, while Essay B omits essential components like the background and variables, Essay A is the better submission.",
