  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B because it presents a more complete, rigorous, and well-communicated scientific investigation. \n\n**Research Question & Background:** Essay A's research question is specific and well-defined: 'What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2 in the degradation of Methyl Orange, in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light, for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 and 0.110 mmol dm-3'. It provides a thorough background on the 'Photo-Fenton reaction' and the 'scavenging effect', demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry. In contrast, Essay B's research question, 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?', is adequate but less detailed, and the provided text lacks any background information, which is a major omission.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Essay A offers a detailed, step-by-step methodology, including pilot studies to refine concentrations ('During preliminary trials... it was decided that such a concentration would be unsuitable'). It clearly identifies and justifies independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a structured table. Essay B's provided text is incomplete, starting mid-procedure ('Step 7') and fails to explicitly list or discuss the control of variables, which is a significant weakness.\n\n**Analysis & Evaluation:** Essay A provides a thorough analysis of its results and a self-critical evaluation that identifies specific limitations like reaction quenching and potential decomposition of H2O2, offering credible suggestions for improvement. Essay B's evaluation is generic and lacks depth. For instance, stating 'heat loss to the surroundings' is a common point, but Essay A's analysis of specific chemical stability issues is more sophisticated.\n\nTherefore, due to its comprehensive nature, clear experimental design, and insightful analysis, Essay A is the superior submission.",
