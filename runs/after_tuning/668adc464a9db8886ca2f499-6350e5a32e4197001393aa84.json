  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused research question, meticulously detailed methodology, and stronger overall experimental design.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a more precise and focused research question: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". This question is excellent because it specifies the exact concentrations of the independent variable and the precise method of measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is less focused. It introduces a secondary uncontrolled variable (\"different water sources\"), which complicates the investigation and makes it difficult to isolate the effect of salinity alone.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology and control of variables are more rigorous. The \"Pre-Test\" section is a significant strength, showing thoughtful preliminary work to determine the bleach concentration via titration and to find the optimal wavelength for the spectrophotometer. The main methodology clearly outlines the preparation of specific dilutions and the procedure for data collection. Furthermore, the control variables are not only identified but their importance and method of control are explicitly justified, for example: \"Temperature of the environment is a factor that affects the speed of the molecules... [it will be controlled by] conducting the experiment in an environment where the temperature is almost the same every time.\" Essay B's methodology lacks this precision; for example, it instructs to \"pour about 100ml of the water sample\" and fails to specify the different masses of NaCl that will be used.\n\nThird, the background information in Essay A is more effectively targeted to support the investigation. It concisely explains the Beer-Lambert law, the chemical nature of bleach and dyes, and the kinetics principles that underpin the experiment. Essay B's background is relevant but spends significant time comparing two measurement techniques (Winkler vs. probe), which detracts from the central question concerning the effect of salinity on dissolved oxygen.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide adequate safety and environmental considerations, Essay A's presentation is more organized and detailed. It uses a table to clearly link specific chemicals like \"Bleach (NaClO)\" to their hazards, precautions, and emergency actions. Essay B's bulleted list is acceptable, but less thorough. Essay A\u2019s discussion of environmental disposal is also more specific: \"these two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" This level of detail and rigorous scientific planning makes Essay A the better submission.",
