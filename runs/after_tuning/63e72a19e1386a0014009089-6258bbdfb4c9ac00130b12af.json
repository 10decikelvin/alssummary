  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong research questions and methodologies. Essay A's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt... affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...?\" is focused and includes specific concentrations. Essay B's question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures... by determining Acid value and saponification value...\" is similarly well-defined. Both provide relevant background information and detailed, repeatable procedures. However, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to the exploration criteria. Its methodology is not only detailed but also includes a separate \"Justification for methodology\" section, explaining the choice of temperatures and concentrations. The most significant differentiator is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. While Essay A has a good safety section, it completely omits ethical and environmental aspects. In contrast, Essay B explicitly addresses all three components, stating for ethics, \"There were no ethical issues in this investigation... But oil... was not either wasted or used in excess,\" and for environmental impact, \"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\" This comprehensive treatment of all required elements makes Essay B a superior example of Criterion B.",
