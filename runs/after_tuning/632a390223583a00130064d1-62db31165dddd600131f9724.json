  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it presents a complete and highly detailed plan for investigation, excelling in all aspects of Criterion B. In contrast, Essay B, while having a solid scientific background, is critically incomplete in the provided text.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is more specific and focused than Essay B's \"What is the Relationship Between Temperature on Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Concentration in Lemon Juice?\". Essay A explicitly states the independent variable's range, which is a hallmark of a well-developed research question.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology and variable control are exceptionally thorough. It provides a detailed, step-by-step procedure and an extensive table of controlled variables, explaining not only *what* will be controlled (e.g., \"Amount of Cornstarch\") but also *how* (\"measured with a scale with an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.01g\") and *why* it matters (\"Having different amounts of cornstarch would mean that different samples have more or less to polymerize\"). Essay B's provided text lacks a methodology and a complete variables section, making it impossible to assess the appropriateness or feasibility of its experimental design.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, which are completely absent in the provided text for Essay B. Essay A includes a detailed risk assessment table covering safety (\"Handling of glass\", \"Working with hot solutions\"), environmental impact (\"Disposal of bioplastics...they should be compostable\"), and ethical considerations (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\"). The absence of this section in Essay B for a proposed experimental investigation is a major omission. While Essay B's background on ascorbic acid chemistry is well-explained, it cannot compensate for the lack of a detailed experimental plan, variable management, and safety considerations, all of which Essay A provides in exemplary detail.",
