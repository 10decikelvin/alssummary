  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior due to its significantly stronger research design and scientific grounding, despite Essay B having a more complete safety, ethical, and environmental section. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is highly focused and specific, detailing both the variables and the precise analytical method. This is supported by a relevant and detailed background section explaining the \"diverse ion effect.\" In contrast, Essay B's research question is broader, and its background is largely a personal narrative with minimal scientific theory. Most critically, Essay B demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental variables, incorrectly identifying the independent variable as \"Mass of sample before titrating\" when it should be the *source* of the calcium carbonate. Furthermore, its control of temperature for thermal decomposition is weak, stating only that \"the same Bunsen Burner was used,\" which is insufficient for ensuring constant temperature. While Essay B is commendable for its specific environmental consideration (\"The excess HCl and sample solution were properly disposed of... since dumping them outside may affect soil pH...\"), this does not outweigh the foundational flaws in its experimental design. Essay A's sophisticated methodology, including a calibration experiment, and its correct identification and control of variables demonstrate a much higher quality of scientific exploration.",
