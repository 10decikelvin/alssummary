  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable, experimental investigations with clear research questions. Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is slightly superior due to its specificity, including the time frame and analytical technique directly in the question. Essay A's question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear but less detailed. However, Essay A excels in the justification and control of its variables. For instance, it provides a strong rationale for its chosen concentrations, stating, \"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia... E85 is an exception to this and has been used due to the real-world context.\" Furthermore, its method for controlling temperature (\"The air conditioner will be set to 25\u00b0C\") is more robust than Essay B's (\"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard\").\n\nWhile Essay B provides a more detailed, chemical-specific safety table, it suffers from two critical flaws in the final sections of its exploration. First, it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, whereas Essay A correctly addresses this by stating, \"No ethical considerations were considered.\" Second, and more significantly, Essay B's environmental consideration is poor and suggests unsafe lab practice: \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory.\" This is inappropriate for the chemicals used. In contrast, Essay A provides a responsible and specific environmental plan: \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company.\" Because Essay A demonstrates a more complete and responsible approach to the entire experimental design, particularly in its variable control and environmental/ethical considerations, it is the better essay overall.",
