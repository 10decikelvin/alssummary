  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both submissions present well-structured scientific investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and clear approach to the experimental design and reporting.\n\n**Research Question & Background:** Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is slightly more refined than Essay A's \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\". Essay B also provides a dedicated 'Background Information' section with relevant chemical theory, including the reaction equation for the titration, which is absent in the provided text for Essay A.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Essay B excels in this area. It clearly outlines the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Its procedure is detailed in a step-by-step format. In contrast, Essay A only provides a partial procedure (steps 7-10) and does not explicitly list the variables, making it harder to assess the experimental design fully.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Both essays address safety considerations. Essay A mentions the need for \"Personal protection equipment\" and cautions against burns and fumes. Essay B provides more specific instructions, such as \"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware, and check for cracks before heating on a hot plate\" and how to handle iodine solution. Both correctly identify no major ethical concerns. Essay A mentions waste disposal of paraffin wax, while Essay B states there are \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is reasonable given the experiment's nature.\n\nOverall, while both reports are competent, Essay B is superior due to its more detailed methodology, explicit statement of variables, and more thorough background information, which together present a more complete and well-communicated scientific investigation.",
