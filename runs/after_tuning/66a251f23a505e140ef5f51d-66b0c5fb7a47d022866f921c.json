  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the depth of scientific understanding and methodological rigor. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined and focused, specifying the exact conditions: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This contrasts with Essay B's slightly less specific question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\". Furthermore, Essay A's background is rich with relevant, high-level chemical theory, directly linking Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and the Beer-Lambert law to the investigation. Essay B's background, while providing good real-world context, is less theoretically dense.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A employs a more sophisticated and precise technique (colorimetry with a calibration curve), which is highly appropriate for determining equilibrium concentrations. The inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" to solve issues like reactant absorbance and to determine the time to reach equilibrium shows a very high level of engagement and planning. In contrast, Essay B uses simple spirit burner calorimetry, a method known for significant systematic error, which the student correctly identifies: \"a high systematic error doesn't undermine the final conclusions obtained as the purpose is to just determine a trend\". While this awareness is good, the method itself is fundamentally less precise than Essay A's. Finally, while both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay A is more specific, noting particular hazards such as how \"potassium thiocyanate... heated too strongly... may decompose and form cyanide gas\". Essay B's safety notes are more general, stating \"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard to limit air intoxication\". For these reasons, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically rigorous exploration.",
