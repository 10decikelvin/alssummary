  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work, but Essay A demonstrates a slightly more thorough and reflective approach to experimental design, particularly in its treatment of variables.\n\n**Research Question & Background:**\nBoth essays feature excellent research questions. Essay A's is clear and specifies the IV range: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". Essay B's is equally strong and detailed: \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity of a Carbonate-Bicarbonate buffer solution...\". Essay B's background is more academically rigorous, providing relevant chemical equations and a detailed explanation of buffer capacity, including the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Essay A's background is good but lacks a chemical explanation for how sodium bicarbonate might affect the bioplastic's properties.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:**\nBoth methodologies are appropriate and well-detailed. However, Essay A excels in its identification and control of variables. Its controlled variables table is extensive, explaining not only the method of control but also the potential impact of each variable on the results. Crucially, Essay A includes a section on \"Uncontrolled Variables,\" such as \"Uniform Depth of Sample,\" which demonstrates a superior level of critical thinking about the experiment's limitations before it is even conducted. While Essay B identifies its main variables correctly, its controlled variables list is less comprehensive, and it does not explicitly consider uncontrolled variables.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:**\nBoth are experimental investigations and address these considerations well. Essay A provides a slightly more thoughtful analysis, particularly in its ethical considerations, where it discusses the use of edible materials: \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted... We must be conscious of the materials used...\". Essay B's assessment is acceptable but less reflective, stating, \"It is believed that no ethical considerations were present in this experiment.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile Essay B has a stronger theoretical background, Essay A's meticulous planning, particularly its comprehensive analysis of controlled and uncontrolled variables, demonstrates a more advanced understanding of practical experimental design. This detailed consideration of potential sources of error and their management gives it the edge.",
