  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for a chemistry investigation. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of engagement, planning, and critical thinking, making it the superior of the two.\n\n**Research Question:** Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is exemplary. It is focused, specifies the exact range of the independent variable (pH), and clearly states the dependent variable (mass of iron(II) extracted) and the precise method of measurement (titration with acidified KMnO\u2084). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is good but less detailed; it could be improved by specifying the method for determining activation energy (e.g., via rate constant measurements at various temperatures).\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Essay B's background provides excellent context by linking the investigation to the real-world issue of anemia and the function of iron tablets. Crucially, it includes a justification calculation for the concentration of KMnO\u2084 used, demonstrating thorough preliminary work. Essay A's background is also relevant, explaining catalysts and the Arrhenius equation, but contains a minor chemical inaccuracy by comparing the strength of two strong acids (HCl and H\u2082SO\u2084) using their pKa values, which is not relevant when they are fully dissociated. While both methodologies are clear and repeatable, Essay B's \"Evaluation\" section is far more detailed and insightful, identifying multiple specific potential errors (e.g., \"the iron(II) may be oxidised to iron(III) while in the HCl solution,\" \"the KMnO\u2084 was not standardised\") and suggesting sophisticated improvements like using a colorimeter. Essay A's evaluation is good but less comprehensive.\n\n**Variables & Safety:** Both essays do a good job of identifying variables and outlining safety, ethical, and environmental considerations appropriate for an experimental lab investigation. They both provide specific disposal instructions and demonstrate an awareness of chemical hazards.\n\nOverall, Essay B is stronger due to its more detailed and focused research question, its excellent contextual background, and its exceptionally thorough and insightful evaluation of the proposed methodology. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of both the chemical principles and the practical challenges of the investigation.",
