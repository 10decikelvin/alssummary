  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior to Essay A across all assessed criteria for a scientific investigation. \n\nFirstly, the research question in Essay B, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\" is significantly more precise and well-defined than that of Essay A, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\". Essay B's question specifies the timeframe (5 days) and the measurement technique (Winkler method), demonstrating a clearer investigative plan. \n\nSecondly, Essay B provides a comprehensive background section that explains key concepts like Biological Oxygen Demand and the principles of the Winkler titration, including chemical equations. In contrast, the provided text for Essay A lacks any background information, leaving the reader to guess the context and theoretical basis of the experiment.\n\nThirdly, the methodology and variable control in Essay B are clearly articulated. It explicitly lists independent, dependent, and controlled variables, and provides a step-by-step procedure. For instance, it specifies \"Using 0.0393 mol/dm\u00b3 for all three pH variations\" as a controlled variable. Essay A's description of its method is less detailed, and it doesn't clearly delineate its variables in the provided text.\n\nFinally, both essays address safety and environmental concerns. However, Essay B's approach is more thorough, listing specific chemicals and their associated hazards (e.g., \"H\u2082SO\u2084...Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\") and outlining waste disposal procedures. Essay A's safety section is more generic. Therefore, Essay B demonstrates a much stronger understanding and execution of a scientific investigation.",
