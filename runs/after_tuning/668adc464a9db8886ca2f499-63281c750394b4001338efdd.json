  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger fulfillment of Criterion B across all aspects. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining the exact concentrations and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is adequate but lacks this level of focus. Essay A's methodology is also superior; it details a pre-test to determine the concentration of the commercial bleach and precisely outlines the preparation of all five concentrations. Essay B's procedure is less complete, stating it will test different masses but only specifying the first one: \"1.5g of Potassium nitrate is measured... Repeat step 1 up to 10 for the remaining masses of KNO3\". Furthermore, Essay A's discussion of variables is more thorough, particularly in its table of controlled variables, which provides a detailed justification for the significance of each. Finally, the safety and environmental considerations in Essay A are specific to the chemicals used, as seen in its detailed \"Safety Data Sheet\" table and its explanation for waste disposal. Essay B's safety precautions are generic (\"Wear rubber gloves\"), and while it correctly identifies no ethical concerns, its overall treatment of risk and disposal is less developed.",
