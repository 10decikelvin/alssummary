  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its more thorough and reflective experimental design.\n\n**Research Question:** Both essays have clear and focused research questions. Essay A asks, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", which is excellent in its specificity of concentrations and methodology. Essay B's question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also strong, clearly defining the independent and dependent variables and the specific concentrations to be tested.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Essay A provides a strong chemical background, explaining the Beer-Lambert law and the titration process needed to determine the initial bleach concentration. This shows a deep understanding of the principles behind the method. Essay B's background on polymers and Young's Modulus is also relevant and focused. Both methodologies are appropriate and detailed enough to be replicated. Essay B's method, incorporating a force sensor and video analysis software, demonstrates a particularly sophisticated approach to data collection.\n\n**Variables & Risk Assessment:** This is where Essay B excels. While both essays correctly identify independent, dependent, and controlled variables, Essay B goes further by including a section on \"Uncontrolled Variables,\" such as the \"Uniform thickness of the plastics.\" This demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking about the limitations of the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B's \"Risk Assessment\" is more comprehensive. Essay A has a good safety and environmental section, noting that hazardous chemicals \"were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor.\" However, Essay B explicitly addresses safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. Its ethical consideration (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\") is a thoughtful and mature reflection that is entirely absent from Essay A. This holistic approach to the investigation's context makes Essay B's design more complete.\n\nUltimately, while Essay A is a very competent piece of work with a strong chemical foundation, Essay B's superior evaluation of experimental limitations (uncontrolled variables) and its inclusion of ethical considerations give it the edge.",
