  "reasoning": "Both essays describe well-designed experimental investigations. However, Essay A is superior due to its more specific research question and its comprehensive treatment of all required Criterion B components, particularly safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity... as determined by the volume of 0.1M Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) or 0.1M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)...\". By including the specific ratios of the independent variable and the method of determination for the dependent variable, it sets a very clear and focused scope for the investigation. While Essay B's research question is clear, it lacks this level of initial specificity.\n\nSecond, while both essays demonstrate appropriate methodologies and strong identification of variables, Essay A provides a more complete assessment of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Essay A explicitly addresses all three components in a detailed risk assessment table. It considers safety (\"Exposure to chemicals... Use of personal protective equipment\"), ethics (\"It is believed that no ethical considerations were present in this experiment.\"), and environmental impact (\"NaOH is a corrosive chemical that can harm aquatic life... but the majority of it is neutralised...\"). In contrast, Essay B provides a brief paragraph on safety but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. For an experimental investigation involving chemicals, this is a significant flaw and marks a clear distinction in quality between the two essays.\n\nEssay B's background on the \"salting in\" effect and its well-structured methodology, including a necessary calibration experiment, are commendable strengths. However, these do not compensate for the critical omissions in the required S/E/E sections. Essay A presents a fully realized exploration plan that thoroughly addresses every element of the criterion, making it the stronger submission.",
