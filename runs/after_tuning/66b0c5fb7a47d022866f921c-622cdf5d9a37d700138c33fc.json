  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and demonstrate solid approaches to Criterion B. However, Essay B is superior due to the significantly higher quality and specificity of its foundational elements: the research question, background information, and methodology.\n\nEssay B's research question is exemplary in its detail: \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created.\" It clearly outlines the independent variable (oils with different saturation), dependent variable (rate of Maillard Reaction), and explicitly states the measurement technique (colorimetric evaluation of AGEs). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\" is clear and focused but lacks the same level of specificity. Furthermore, Essay B's background information is more comprehensive, not only explaining the Maillard reaction but also the scientific principles of the measurement technique, referencing the \"Lambert-Beer Law\" and justifying the choice of wavelength. This demonstrates a deeper level of research and understanding.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are appropriate, but Essay B's is more ambitious and sophisticated, explicitly stating its method was adapted from a \"research paper published on the Journal of Food Processing & Technology by Toshiyuki Toyosaki et al.\" This shows a higher level of engagement with scientific literature. Essay B also defines its dependent variable with greater precision, whereas Essay A imprecisely lists the \"total mass of the fuel burnt\" as the dependent variable, when this is actually a measurement used to calculate the enthalpy of combustion.\n\nThe primary weakness of Essay B lies in its risk assessment, which covers safety (\"Oven (High Temperatures): Heat-proof gloves were worn\") but completely omits the required ethical and environmental considerations. Essay A handles this aspect perfectly, explicitly stating \"No ethical considerations were considered\" and providing specific disposal instructions: \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company.\" While this omission is a significant flaw in Essay B, the overall strength and depth of its scientific exploration\u2014from the research question to the background and methodology\u2014demonstrate a more advanced and personally engaged investigation, making it the better essay overall.",
