  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental designs, but Essay A is superior due to its comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements, particularly its thorough treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nBoth essays feature clear and highly specific research questions. Essay A's RQ, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is excellent because it specifies the exact temperatures and the measurement methods. Similarly, Essay B's two-part RQ is very focused, asking \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)...\" and \"b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\" Both provide a solid foundation for their respective investigations.\n\nIn terms of methodology and variables, both are very well-planned. Essay A outlines a complex procedure involving reflux and multiple titrations, and provides a \"Justification for methodology\" section that explains choices like using a \"soxhlet apparatus... since it is easier to manage temperature.\" Essay B's calorimetry method is appropriate for its RQ, and its control over variables, especially controlling for the \"Molar mass of Alcohol Isomers,\" is crucial and well-conceived.\n\nHowever, the primary differentiator lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) sections. Essay A provides a detailed risk assessment table identifying specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"Hazardous liquids (HCl, KOH).\" Crucially, it also explicitly addresses ethical considerations, stating \"it was not either wasted or used in excess,\" and environmental impact, noting that \"Prepared chemicals such as KOH and HCl are poisonous... All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines.\" In contrast, while Essay B adequately addresses safety risks like the \"Spillage of alcohols,\" it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation involving chemicals. This omission makes Essay A a more complete and well-rounded exploration.",
