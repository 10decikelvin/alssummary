  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of rigor and thoroughness in its experimental design, making it the superior submission for Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research question and background, both essays perform well. Essay A's question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is clear and focused. Essay B's question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\", is also strong and benefits from including the specific range of the independent variable directly within the question. Both provide relevant background information, with Essay A effectively explaining the theory of heterogeneous catalysis and Essay B clearly defining the chemical principles behind Acid Value and Saponification Value.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the methodology and control of variables. Essay B's methodology is significantly more complex and analytically sound, involving reflux and multiple titrations to determine chemical properties. This demonstrates a more sophisticated approach than Essay A's method of measuring foam height in a graduated cylinder, a technique acknowledged by the student as a departure from convention and one that is inherently less precise. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of controlled variables is exemplary. The table format, which includes \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\" columns, shows a deep understanding of experimental design. For instance, controlling for 'Moisture' is justified because \"Different moisture content in oil affects the amount of free fatty acid present in oil.\" Essay A identifies key controlled variables but provides less detailed justification for their control.\n\nFinally, both essays successfully address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is crucial for experimental work. Both identify specific chemical hazards and outline appropriate precautions. Essay B's risk assessment is slightly more detailed, covering risks like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and potential \"bursting of flask\" during reflux, reflecting the more hazardous nature of its procedure. Both correctly state there are no ethical issues and describe appropriate waste disposal, with Essay A noting that waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\". While both are competent in this area, Essay B's superior methodological rigor and more comprehensive control of variables establish it as the stronger exploration.",
