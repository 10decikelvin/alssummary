  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of quality for Criterion B. Essay A presents a well-defined research question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". Similarly, Essay B's question is also highly specific: \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity...\". Both essays provide relevant, focused background information, a detailed and appropriate methodology, and a comprehensive list of variables with clear explanations for their control.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior due to its significantly more thorough treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is crucial for an experimental investigation. Essay A's environmental section is particularly strong, identifying multiple chemical hazards and providing specific, practical disposal methods. For example, it states, \"Copper sulphate is a pesticide...harmful to the environment and aquatic life\" and suggests disposal by mixing \"with saw dust which can be disposed of as solid waste.\" It also notes that Sulphuric acid \"must be neutralized first then disposed of...with sodium carbonate.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's environmental consideration is brief and less rigorous. It states, \"NaOH is a corrosive chemical...but the majority of it is neutralised through the experiment and it is dilute. A low concentration will have no significant environmental effects.\" This is a simplistic assessment that overlooks the disposal of stock solutions and other chemicals used. While both essays excel in the scientific planning aspects (RQ, background, methodology, variables), Essay A's more comprehensive and responsible approach to the environmental impact of its experiment makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
