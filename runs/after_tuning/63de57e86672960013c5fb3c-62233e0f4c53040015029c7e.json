  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all elements of Criterion B. Both essays describe experimental investigations, making safety, ethical, and environmental considerations mandatory. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is highly specific and focused, clearly defining the independent variable's range and a key controlled parameter. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is less focused and lacks specific parameters within the question itself.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A provides a clear, logical, and repeatable procedure with excellent control of variables. For instance, it specifies how to control the distance between electrodes: \"using a wooden splint placed across the beaker...to ensure the same distance is kept between the electrodes for all trials.\" Essay B's methodology is chaotically structured (e.g., section \u2464 appears before \u2462 and \u2463) and contains a critical design flaw: it describes how to \"heat the Acetate buffer solution until 20.0 \u00b0C\" but includes no mechanism for maintaining this temperature during the addition of NaOH, meaning the independent variable is not actually controlled.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. It provides specific safety advice for multiple chemicals (\"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive...Copper Sulphate solution (Cu\u2082SO\u2084) may be harmful\") and details a responsible environmental disposal plan, stating \"the acid must be neutralized first then disposed of.\" Essay B's safety section is incomplete, addressing only \"Acetic acid\" while ignoring the hazard of NaOH, and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for an experimental investigation. Essay A's comprehensive and rigorous approach to the entire exploration process makes it the better essay.",
