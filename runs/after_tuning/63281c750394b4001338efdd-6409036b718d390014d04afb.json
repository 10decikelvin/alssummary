  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The primary differentiator is the quality and specificity of the research question and the depth of the subsequent exploration. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", is exemplary. It precisely defines the independent variable with specific values and uncertainty and details how the dependent variable will be quantified. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is significantly more thorough and scientifically rigorous. It not only explains the underlying redox chemistry and reaction rate theory but also includes a remarkable section on \"Choice of Materials and Method,\" which details the rationale for selecting a lux sensor over other methods. This demonstrates a thoughtful and well-planned investigation. Essay A's background is relevant but far more superficial. In terms of methodology and variables, Essay B again excels with a sophisticated data-logging approach and a highly detailed table of controlled variables that explains both the reason for control and the method. Essay A's procedure and variable list are adequate but lack this level of detail.\n\nFinally, the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations in Essay B are far more specific and well-developed. It identifies specific chemical hazards, stating \"Potassium bromate(V) (KBrO\u2083) (TOXIC, OXIDISING),\" and details proactive environmental mitigation: \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint.\" Essay A's considerations are generic, such as \"Wear rubber gloves\" for safety and \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\" for environmental impact. While Essay A does explicitly mention ethics, which Essay B omits, the overall quality of Essay B's safety and environmental sections is far higher.",
