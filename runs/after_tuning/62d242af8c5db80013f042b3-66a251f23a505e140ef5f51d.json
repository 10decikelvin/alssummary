  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its greater theoretical depth, more rigorous experimental design, and more comprehensive considerations. Essay B's research question, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures...on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\", is exceptionally clear and focused. Its background information is outstanding, seamlessly integrating complex concepts like Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Beer-Lambert's law to provide a robust theoretical framework for the investigation. A significant strength of Essay B is its inclusion of a \"Preliminary experiments\" section, which demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative process of methodological development, addressing potential issues like the absorbance of reactants before finalizing the procedure.\n\nEssay A also has a very specific research question: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk...is heated at...affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". Its background on complexometric titration is relevant, and the justification for choosing this method over others is a good feature. However, the explanation of the back-titration chemistry is less clear than the theoretical background provided in Essay B. Furthermore, Essay A contains a minor but noticeable inconsistency, listing different temperature values in the research question (20, 40, 60, 80, 100\u00b0C) versus the independent variable table (20, 35, 50, 65, 80\u00b0C). While both essays have excellent, detailed tables for variables and strong safety sections, Essay B's discussion of environmental considerations is more specific, stating \"These chemicals may all pose a risk to aquatic organisms... All 3 chemicals should be kept away from drains,\" whereas Essay A's environmental point is weaker, focusing on minimizing food waste. Overall, Essay B's sophisticated integration of theory, methodological rigour, and completeness makes it the stronger example of scientific exploration.",
