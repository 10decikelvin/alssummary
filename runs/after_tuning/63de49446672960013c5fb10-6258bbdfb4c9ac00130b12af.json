  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental explorations appropriate for IB Chemistry. However, Essay A is superior due to its greater depth in background theory and a more compelling demonstration of personal engagement and problem-solving in its methodological development.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6...\", is well-focused and uses evaluative language. Its background section is exceptionally strong, not only defining Vitamin B6 but also explaining the complex chemical principles underpinning the chosen analytical method. For example, it explains why a colored complex is necessary and links this to crystal field theory: \"the d orbitals will be split into sets of degenerate energy... An electron can transition between two orbitals... by absorbing a photon... in the range of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum\". Furthermore, Essay A's methodology section details a clear process of development and refinement through pilot studies, showing genuine exploration. The student identifies problems (\"it was discovered that a white powder remained... I noticed a green precipitate forming\") and intelligently devises solutions (\"To remove these contaminants... I decided to filter it... I chose to implement the concept micelles formation\"). This iterative problem-solving is a hallmark of an excellent investigation.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures... by determining Acid value and saponification value...\", is also clear and detailed. Its methodology is appropriate, and the presentation of controlled variables in a table with a \"Why to control?\" column is exemplary. The safety, ethical, and environmental sections are also thorough and well-structured. However, its background information, while relevant, is more definitional than explanatory. It states that \"The acid value is regarded as an important indicator of oil oxidation\" but does not provide the same level of underlying chemical theory as Essay A. While it mentions a preliminary experiment, it lacks the detailed narrative of overcoming unforeseen experimental challenges that makes Essay A's exploration stand out.\n\nUltimately, Essay A is better because it pairs a sophisticated, well-justified methodology with a deeper theoretical foundation and a more convincing account of personal engagement in developing and adapting the procedure in response to observed challenges.",
