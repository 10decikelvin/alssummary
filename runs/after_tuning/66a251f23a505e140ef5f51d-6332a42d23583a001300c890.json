  "reasoning": "Essay A is decisively better as it demonstrates a higher level of detail, rigor, and personal engagement across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining the \"temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C)\" and initial reactant concentrations, whereas Essay B's question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature...\", is clear but lacks this precision. Furthermore, Essay A's background is more thorough, integrating concepts like Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and Beer-Lambert's law, and critically includes a section on \"Preliminary experiments\" to justify its methodological choices. In contrast, Essay B weakens its exploration by simply citing the reaction order from an external source, stating, \"As seen in an article by the Universiti Teknologi MARA, the orders of reactants are 1 and 1\". Methodologically, Essay A's use of a colorimeter is objectively more precise than Essay B's subjective visual timing of a color change. The discussion of variables in Essay A is superior; its table format explicitly links the variable to why it's controlled and how it is controlled, a level of detail not present in Essay B's bulleted list. Finally, Essay A\u2019s safety section provides specific risks and tailored mitigation, such as noting that potassium thiocyanate with acid \"liberates toxic gas,\" a more robust approach than Essay B\u2019s generic control measure of using \"Very careful operations during the experiment\".",
