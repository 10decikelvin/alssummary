  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's is stronger due to its inclusion of specific voltage values and the method of measuring the dependent variable, making it more focused. While both have relevant background information, Essay A's coverage of 'the structure and importance of graphene in electrical conductivity' is slightly less focused than Essay B's discussion of 'Electroplating' and 'Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis.' Both essays have well-defined methodologies and clear identification of variables. However, Essay A lacks a dedicated section on safety, environmental, or ethical considerations, which is a significant omission for a lab-based experiment involving electricity. In contrast, Essay B provides a detailed 'RISK ASSESSMENT' table covering 'Handling of Corrosive Chemicals', 'Use of Glassware', and 'Handling of Hot Temperatures', demonstrating a thorough understanding of safety protocols. Although both essays include a 'Weaknesses' section, Essay B's is more comprehensive, detailing issues like fragile zinc coating and potential errors in timing, and offering specific improvements. The inclusion of a detailed safety assessment and more specific procedural details makes Essay B a stronger example of a well-planned scientific investigation.",
