  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it provides a far more detailed, rigorous, and comprehensive exploration of its topic. Firstly, Essay B's research question is significantly more specific and complex: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\". This clearly outlines the quantitative range of the independent variable and specifies the two distinct, chemically relevant dependent variables. In contrast, Essay A's question, while clear, is simpler, investigating categorical brands: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\". Secondly, Essay B's methodology is more advanced, including procedures for standardizing reagents and employing techniques like reflux, and it includes a \"Justification for methodology\" section that demonstrates a higher level of planning. Essay A's methodology is a standard liquid-liquid extraction, which is appropriate but less demanding. Thirdly, Essay B excels in its identification and control of variables, considering subtle factors such as \"Microbial Contamination\" and \"Light\" because it \"triggers decomposition of oil\". Finally, and most critically, both are experimental investigations, yet only Essay B thoroughly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides a detailed risk assessment table and explicitly states its ethical (\"There were no ethical issues...\") and environmental approaches (\"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines...\"). Essay A includes a basic safety section but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental impacts, a major flaw for a lab-based investigation using a chlorinated solvent.",
