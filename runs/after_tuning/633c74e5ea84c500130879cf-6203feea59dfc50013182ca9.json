  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much stronger and more thorough approach to experimental design under Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is highly focused and detailed, specifying the variables, duration, and analytical technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad and lacks specificity regarding the chosen ions, metal, or temperature range. Furthermore, Essay B provides comprehensive, relevant background information, including the specific redox reactions of the Winkler method, whereas Essay A's background is superficial.\n\nThe superiority of Essay B continues in its identification and control of variables. Essay B clearly defines its independent variable (three specific pH ranges), dependent variable (BOD), and provides a detailed table of controlled variables with justification. Essay A's variable section is confused, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as two separate independent variables, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the experimental design. Finally, Essay B includes a detailed, chemical-specific safety table (e.g., noting H\u2082SO\u2084 can cause \"Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\") and explicitly, though briefly, addresses environmental disposal (\"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\"). Essay A's safety section is generic (\"can cause irritation\") and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, a critical flaw for an experimental investigation.",
