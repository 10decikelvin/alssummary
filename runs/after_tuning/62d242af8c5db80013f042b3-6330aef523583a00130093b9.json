  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger in Criterion B due to its well-defined research question, meticulous handling of variables, and comprehensive safety and environmental considerations. Essay A's research question, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is exemplary. It is focused, includes the specific range for the independent variable, and names the precise analytical technique. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\", is a less effective closed question.\n\nEssay A's methodology is appropriate, and its treatment of variables is far superior. The controlled variables are listed in an extensive table with clear methods for control and justification for why they matter, such as controlling the \"Volume of the sample (10.0cm\u00b3)\" because \"The number of calcium ions in the milk will be increased if the amount of sample used increases.\" Essay B, however, displays a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design by incorrectly identifying its variables; it lists \"Temperature change\" as the independent variable and \"Different types of substances\" as the dependent variable, when the opposite is true. This is a significant flaw.\n\nFinally, while both essays are experimental investigations, Essay A provides more thorough safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It presents a detailed safety table, explicitly states \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved,\" and addresses environmental impact by planning to \"reduce the tendency of food wastage.\" Essay B includes adequate safety notes and a brief mention of disposal (\"disposed of in the designated container\") but completely omits ethical considerations. Overall, Essay A presents a more scientifically rigorous and well-planned investigation.",
