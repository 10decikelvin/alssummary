  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the requirements for Criterion B. Its research question is exemplary: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\" This question is focused, precise, and testable, clearly outlining the independent variable with its range, the dependent variable, and the specific methodology. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\" is a less sophisticated yes/no question that lacks the same level of experimental detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its identification and control of variables. The independent, dependent, and a comprehensive list of controlled variables are correctly identified and presented in a clear table with methods for their control. Essay A, however, fundamentally misunderstands this concept, stating, \"Dependent: Different types of substances dissolved... Independent: Temperature change...\". This is incorrect; the type of substance is the independent variable and the temperature change is the dependent variable, a significant flaw in experimental design.\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a comprehensive and thoughtful treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It details specific chemical hazards, justifies the use of a fume cupboard, and explicitly addresses ethical concerns by stating, \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved...\". It also considers environmental impact in terms of \"reduc[ing] the tendency of food wastage\". Essay A provides adequate safety precautions but fails to address ethical considerations and only briefly mentions environmental impact (\"disposed of in the designated container\"). While Essay A's background and theoretical framework are sound, the fundamental error in identifying variables and the superior detail and clarity of Essay B across all other sections make Essay B the clear winner.",
