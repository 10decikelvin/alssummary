  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's is more detailed, specifying the independent variables (salinity from 0-5%, temperature from 15-65\u00b0C) and the method ('Winkler's titration'). Essay A's RQ, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion?\" is less specific, failing to define \"different masses\". While Essay A provides a basic method, it's less thorough than Essay B's comprehensive, step-by-step description of preparing solutions and conducting the titration. Both essays identify their variables correctly. However, Essay B's discussion of controlled variables is more extensive and includes justifications. For safety, both are adequate, but Essay A's 'wear PPE' is generic compared to Essay B's specific chemical handling instructions. Crucially, Essay A completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, while Essay B explicitly states \"No pertinent ethical considerations for this experiment exist,\" which is a required component. Similarly, Essay B's consideration of environmental impact is more thoughtful, discussing chemical disposal, whereas Essay A's is limited to soot production. Overall, Essay B is superior due to its more detailed and comprehensive approach across all sections, from the research question to the methodology and safety protocols.",
