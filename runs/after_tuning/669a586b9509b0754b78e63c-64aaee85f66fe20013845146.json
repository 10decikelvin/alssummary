  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly focused and detailed research question: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3...1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This RQ is exemplary as it specifies the exact quantities, concentrations, and measurement parameters. In contrast, Essay B's RQ, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", is clear but lacks the same level of scientific specificity regarding experimental conditions.\n\nSecond, the methodology and control of variables in Essay A are far more rigorous. Essay A includes a dedicated \"Pre-test\" section, demonstrating a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. Its table of controlled variables is outstanding, detailing not only what and how variables are controlled, but also providing a scientific justification for why. Essay B's methodology omits critical parameters like brewing time and extraction shaking time, and its controlled variables table lacks the same depth of justification.\n\nFinally, Essay A's handling of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations is comprehensive, as required for an experimental investigation. It provides a detailed safety table and explicitly discusses environmental impact and waste disposal, stating, \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\". Essay B addresses safety precautions for dichloromethane but critically fails to address the environmental impact or proper disposal of this hazardous organic solvent, a major omission for this type of experiment. It also neglects to mention ethical considerations. For these reasons, Essay A demonstrates a significantly more thorough and scientifically sound exploration.",
