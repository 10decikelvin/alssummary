  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and competent investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness, depth, and adherence to the IB criteria for Exploration.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is exceptionally well-focused and detailed, specifying the independent variable with a clear range, the dependent variable, the substance being investigated, and the precise analytical method. Essay A's question is also good but slightly less detailed, listing concentrations without the context of a range. The background information in Essay B is significantly more advanced and relevant, discussing specific chemical mechanisms like \"ion exchange and chelation\" and linking them to the functional groups in orange peels like \"carboxylate groups (-RCOO-), carboxylic groups (-COOH) and hydroxyl groups\". In contrast, Essay A's background on collision theory is more general for a kinetics experiment.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are strong, but Essay B shows a more rigorous approach. It includes detailed \"Preliminary Trials\" to justify choices like adsorption time and pH range, and critically, it describes the creation of a calibration curve, which is essential for accurate quantitative analysis with spectrophotometry. Essay B\u2019s control of variables is also more comprehensive, identifying subtle but important factors like \"Brand of Oranges\" and \"Shaking speed (400 rpm)\".\n\nFinally, both investigations are experimental and require full safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides good safety and environmental details, noting that some chemicals were \"disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor.\" However, it fails to explicitly address ethical considerations. Essay B is more complete, providing a section on \"Safety, Ethical and Environmental Concerns\" which clearly states, \"No ethical concerns were raised as no living organisms were harmed during the investigation,\" and specifies that \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area.\" This comprehensive handling of all three aspects, combined with its superior background and methodological rigor, makes Essay B the stronger submission.",
