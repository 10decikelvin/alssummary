  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The final decision favors Essay A due to its scientifically sound methodology and complete fulfillment of the criterion's structural requirements, despite Essay B having a slightly stronger research question and background.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is well-formulated, using evaluative language (\"To what extent\") and clearly defining the variables. Its background on freezing point depression is also excellent. However, its methodology contains a fundamental flaw that undermines the entire investigation. The procedure specifies using equal masses of each salt: \"Measure only 5 grams of each salt using a balance\". This contradicts the background theory, which correctly identifies the number of ions (related to moles, via the Van't Hoff factor) as the crucial factor. Using equal masses of salts with different molar masses makes a fair comparison impossible. Furthermore, Essay B completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a critical failure for an experimental investigation.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear and focused, though less detailed than Essay B's. Its background is strong, correctly calculating the cell potential and Gibbs free energy (`E\u00b0cell = +1.1 V`, `\u0394G\u00b0cell = -212300 kJ`) to establish the reaction's feasibility. Critically, its methodology is appropriate and scientifically valid for investigating the research question. Most importantly, Essay A addresses all required sub-sections. It explicitly states safety precautions (\"wore gloves and laboratory glasses\"), ethical considerations (\"took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions\"), and environmental disposal methods (\"disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\"). While the proposed environmental disposal is questionable, the student has fulfilled the requirement by considering and specifying a plan.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A presents a complete and viable plan for exploration. Its sound experimental design and inclusion of all required S/E/E components make it superior to Essay B, which suffers from a fatal methodological flaw and a major structural omission.",
