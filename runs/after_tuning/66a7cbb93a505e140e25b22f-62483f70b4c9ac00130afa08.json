  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and address the necessary components of Criterion B, but Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of inquiry and depth.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is more sophisticated than Essay A's. The evaluative phrase \"To what extent\" frames the investigation as a critical assessment of a scientific method, which is a higher-order task than the comparative question in Essay A: \"How do different active ingredients... compare...\".\n\nThe background information in Essay B is exceptionally thorough and scientifically mature. It connects the investigation to a contemporary global issue (global warming), explains the underlying chemistry using Le Chatelier's Principle, and details the complex multi-step reaction mechanism of the Winkler method with chemical equations. In contrast, Essay A's background on neutralization, while relevant and correct, is more fundamental and less detailed.\n\nWhile both methodologies are appropriate, Essay B's is based on a more complex analytical procedure (the Winkler method). Furthermore, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are more specific and robust. Essay B identifies hazards for multiple specific chemicals (\"Alkali-iodide-azide \u2013 Very corrosive... Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive\") and provides specific disposal instructions. Essay A's safety precautions are more general, focusing on \"handling strong acids like HCl\", although its environmental note on acid disposal is good.\n\nEssay A presents a competent and well-structured investigation that meets the criteria. However, Essay B's exploration is superior due to its more advanced research question, a much deeper and more researched background section that provides a clear rationale for the investigation, and more specific safety and environmental protocols.",
