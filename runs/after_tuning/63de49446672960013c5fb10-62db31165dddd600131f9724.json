  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. Essay A begins with a highly focused and detailed research question: \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", which is specific about the substance, its form, its source, and uses the evaluative phrase \"to what extent.\" In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is exceptionally well-developed, featuring a \"Development and pilot studies\" section that shows authentic engagement and problem-solving to address issues like precipitate formation. Essay B, on the other hand, is critically incomplete; it fails to provide a procedure, and its \"Variables\" section is merely an empty table header: \"| Variable | Details | Method of Measurement\". Essay A provides a comprehensive list of controlled variables, from \"The specific PASCO UV-Vis spectrometer\" to using \"the same cuvette for every trial.\" Finally, Essay A includes specific safety considerations for its chemicals (\"SDS causes serious eye irritation and mild skin irritation, so gloves must be worn\") and addresses ethical and environmental aspects. Essay B completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, a major flaw for an experimental investigation. While Essay B's background on redox titration is relevant, its fundamental incompleteness in methodology, variables, and safety protocols makes Essay A the far better example of a well-planned scientific exploration.",
