  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its exceptionally focused research question, deep scientific background, and well-controlled experimental design. The research question in Essay A is a model of clarity and specificity, stating: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This precision allows for a highly focused investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question is fundamentally confused, claiming to use \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary experiment, and using a vague independent variable of \"pollution level.\" Essay A's background information is directly relevant, explaining complex concepts like the \"Photo-Fenton reaction\" and the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2,\" which directly inform the methodology. Essay B's background is more general and its justification for the pollution levels of its samples is qualitative and observational (e.g., \"stream from Saidpur Village was polluted since there was some algae growth and plastic present\"). Furthermore, Essay A's methodology shows evidence of thoughtful refinement through \"Preliminary Trials\" and includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear justifications for their control. While Essay B describes a valid chemical procedure (Winkler's method) and has a very thorough, chemical-specific risk assessment (\"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer\"), its overall experimental design is weak due to the poorly defined and uncontrolled nature of its independent variable. Ultimately, the scientific rigor, clarity, and focus from the research question through to the methodology make Essay A the better submission.",
