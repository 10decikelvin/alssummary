  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher quality of exploration overall due to its more complex research question and deeper engagement with the underlying chemistry.\n\nEssay B's research question is exceptionally detailed: \"How do different active ingredients (calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, and aluminium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate) in different brands of indigestion tablets (antacids A, B, and C) compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\". This question clearly outlines a comparison between three distinct chemical systems. This is supported by a strong background section that provides balanced chemical equations for each specific antacid, demonstrating a thorough understanding. Furthermore, Essay B provides a specific and justified environmental consideration: \"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker, this is because hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes if poured down the drain.\" In contrast, Essay A simply states, \"No significant environmental concerns.\"\n\nEssay A is also a strong piece of work. Its research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is focused and uses appropriate evaluative language. The methodology is logical, and its safety section is more specific than Essay B's, noting risks with both hot plates and iodine: \"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware...Avoid getting iodine solution in eyes, on skin or on clothing.\" However, its investigation into a single chemical system is less complex than Essay B's comparative study. While its variable control is arguably more rigorous than Essay B's (which justifies not controlling tablet mass for realism), the superior chemical depth and more ambitious scope of Essay B's initial exploration make it the better assignment.",
