  "reasoning": "The primary determination is based on the completeness and appropriateness of the core experimental design elements. Essay B is a data-based investigation, while Essay A is an experimental one. Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more complete approach to Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, Essay B's two-part question is more detailed and specific: \"1. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion? 2. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its boiling point?\". It clearly defines the independent and dependent variables. Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity.\n\nSecond, the methodology and variables sections reveal a critical difference. Essay B outlines a clear and appropriate data-based methodology, citing specific, reliable databases like \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook.\" It also correctly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables within the methodology section: \"The variables are controlled by including only linear primary alcohols.\" In contrast, Essay A completely fails to define its variables, presenting a table with headings but no content, which is a fundamental flaw in experimental design.\n\nFinally, the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations seals the decision. As an experimental investigation involving chemicals, Essay A's complete omission of any safety protocols or environmental disposal considerations is a major and disqualifying flaw. Because Essay B is a data-based investigation, the absence of an S/E/E section is appropriate and not penalized, as these considerations are not relevant to its methodology. While both essays have strong background information sections that connect the science to a personal context, Essay B's foundational elements (methodology, variables, and appropriate adherence to safety standards for its investigation type) are vastly superior.",
