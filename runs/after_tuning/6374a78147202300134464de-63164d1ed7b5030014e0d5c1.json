  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across most aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its well-formulated and detailed research question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\". This question is focused, uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\"), and clearly defines the parameters of the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks the same level of specificity and analytical depth.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is highly focused and directly relevant, explaining the chemical properties of ascorbic acid, its heat sensitivity, and the specific redox titration chemistry that underpins the methodology. Essay A's background, while containing some good detail on the reaction's feasibility using Gibbs free energy, is built on a significant conceptual misunderstanding. It states, \"most reaction rates increase as concentrations increases... This therefore causes faster production of heat,\" incorrectly conflating the rate of reaction (kinetics) with the total enthalpy change (a thermodynamic state function), which is the focus of its investigation. This flaw undermines the scientific validity of the exploration's premise.\n\nBoth essays correctly identify their independent, dependent, and controlled variables. However, Essay B's methodology and risk assessment are far more robust. Essay B provides specific, relevant safety precautions for its experimental setup, noting \"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware... check for cracks before heating on a hot plate\" and \"Iodine solution should be handled with care. Avoid getting iodine solution in eyes, on skin or on clothing.\" Essay A's risk assessment is weak and contradictory. It states, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain,\" which is poor environmental practice, and then immediately contradicts this by claiming, \"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways as they are hazardous and toxic.\" This demonstrates a poor understanding of safe and environmentally responsible chemical disposal. Overall, Essay B presents a more scientifically sound, well-planned, and safely considered investigation.",
