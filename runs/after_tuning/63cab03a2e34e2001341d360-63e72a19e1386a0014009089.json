  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A.\n\nThe primary strength of Essay B lies in its exceptionally well-formulated research question: \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\" This question is focused, specific, and measurable, clearly identifying the independent variable (NaCl concentration with a defined range and uncertainty) and the dependent variable (DO concentration). This clarity guides the entire investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\", is confusing and contains a critical contradiction. It claims to use \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment using the Winkler method. Furthermore, its independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is qualitative and poorly controlled, relying on subjective observations and disparate secondary sources rather than a quantifiable, systematic measurement.\n\nEssay B's methodology is logical and directly addresses its research question. It includes detailed steps for preparing standard solutions and outlines a controlled experiment with five trials for each concentration, demonstrating strong experimental design. Essay A's methodology, while detailed, is disconnected from its stated research question.\n\nRegarding the other criteria, Essay B provides a much more thorough and chemically-focused background, explaining the \"salting out\" effect with concepts like polarity and ion-dipole forces. Essay B also presents a superior variables section, using a table to clearly identify controlled variables and, crucially, explain *why* they must be controlled. While Essay A has a more complete Risk Assessment by including a brief mention of environmental disposal, which Essay B omits, this minor advantage is heavily outweighed by the fundamental flaws in Essay A's research question and experimental design. Essay B's clear, focused, and scientifically sound approach makes it the superior piece of work.",
