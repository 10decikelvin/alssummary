  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for scientific investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and sophistication in its experimental design, particularly in its methodology and consideration of variables.\n\n**Research Question & Background:**\nBoth essays have clear and focused research questions. Essay A's question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is specific and well-defined. Essay B's question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also excellent, clearly stating the independent variable with its range and the dependent variable. The background information in both is relevant and provides a good theoretical basis for the respective investigations. Essay A effectively links reaction kinetics, activation energy, and acid strength. Essay B provides solid information on polymers, plasticizers, and the mechanical properties to be tested.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:**\nThis is where Essay B demonstrates superiority. Essay B's methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining not just the preparation of the bioplastic but also a sophisticated method for data collection using a Vernier LabQuest sensor and Tracker software for analysis. This shows a commitment to precision and accuracy. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is more comprehensive. The author not only identifies and details the control of numerous variables (e.g., \"Amount of Cornstarch\", \"Amount of Water in Original Solution\", \"Amount of time on Bunsen Burner\") but also thoughtfully considers uncontrolled variables like \"Uniform Thickness of the Plastics,\" showing a deep understanding of potential experimental limitations. In contrast, while Essay A's methodology is appropriate, it is less detailed. The student in Essay A identifies a significant flaw in their own procedure: \"when I added cooled reagents to a boiling tube, the temperature of the mixture most likely lowered and did not stay constant,\" which weakens the proposed control of temperature. Essay B's design appears more robust from the outset.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:**\nBoth essays provide good safety and environmental considerations. Essay A correctly identifies hazards like flammability and irritation (\"propanone is highly flammable, irritating to the eyes\") and specifies disposal methods (\"iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste\"). However, Essay B is more comprehensive. It not only covers safety (\"Handling of glass\", \"Working with hot solutions\") and environmental disposal (\"bioplastics...should be compostable and easily biodegradable\"), but it also includes a thoughtful ethical consideration: \"Ethical: Use of edible materials...it is important to understand that starch based bioplastics...utilise large amounts of both starch and water, both materials which could be essentially life-saving.\" This explicit and relevant consideration of all three aspects makes Essay B's treatment of the topic more complete.\n\nOverall, while Essay A describes a solid and classic kinetics experiment, Essay B presents a more ambitious, thoroughly planned, and critically aware investigation. The superior detail in its methodology, the comprehensive control of variables, and the inclusion of ethical considerations make it the stronger piece of work.",
