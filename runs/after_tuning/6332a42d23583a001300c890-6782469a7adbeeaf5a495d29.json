  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific inquiry and specificity, starting with its research question. Essay B's research question, \"What is the pseudo order of reaction... in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3... and 0.110 mmol dm-3,\" is exceptionally detailed, specifying the analytical method, light wavelength, and precise variable ranges. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature...?\", is clear but lacks this high degree of specificity. Furthermore, Essay B establishes a compelling real-world context by linking its investigation to industrial water pollution and explicitly identifying a research gap (\"There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts\"), which is a more sophisticated approach than Essay A's personal interest rationale.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are strong, but Essay B again shows greater depth by detailing its preliminary trials and the subsequent improvements made to the procedure (\"aliquots were subsequently pipetted out every 4 minutes, over 16 minutes as opposed to the original 15 minutes, over an hour\"). This demonstrates an authentic and iterative scientific process. Essay A's methodology is solid and repeatable, but lacks this element of refinement.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety and environmental considerations, Essay A is slightly more complete by explicitly stating there are \"no ethical issues\" and identifying a specific hazardous waste product (potassium hydroxide). Essay B's safety (\"googles were worn when the UV-Lamp was in operation\") and environmental sections are robust but it does not have a standalone ethics statement. However, this minor omission in Essay B is far outweighed by its profound strengths in the foundational aspects of the investigation\u2014the research question, background, and methodological design\u2014making it the clearly stronger essay.",
