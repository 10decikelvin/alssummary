  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations, but Essay A is superior across most aspects of Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question & Background:** Both essays have clear and focused research questions. Essay A's, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6...in Nature\u2019s Own tablets...?\", is slightly more sophisticated than Essay B's \"How does the voltage...affect the mass of zinc deposited...?\" by implying a quantitative relationship will be explored. The background section of Essay A is exceptionally strong. It not only explains the chemistry of Vitamin B6 but also justifies the entire methodological approach by detailing the principles of UV-Vis spectrometry and the necessity of forming a colored complex with copper(II) sulfate. This shows deep, relevant research that directly informs the experimental design. Essay B provides a solid background on electroplating and Faraday's laws but lacks the same depth of connection between the theory and the specific experimental choices.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** This is where Essay A demonstrates a significant advantage. The \"Development and pilot studies\" section in Essay A is outstanding, detailing how the student identified problems (insoluble binders, precipitate formation) and scientifically worked through them to refine the procedure (using filtration, testing different dyes). This shows a high level of engagement and independent thinking. Essay B's procedure is adequate but reads more like a standard lab manual recipe with less justification for the specific choices made. Both identify the key variables correctly, but Essay A's list of controlled variables is more comprehensive and demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of potential sources of error (e.g., \"The same cuvette will be used for every trial,\" \"solutions which have been prepared for longer may result in more degradation\").\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Essay A addresses all three aspects. The safety section is specific, linking chemicals like \"copper(II) sulfate\" and \"SDS\" to their respective hazards (\"irritation,\" \"serious eye irritation\") and required precautions. Essay B also has a good safety section but is slightly less detailed. Crucially, Essay B completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a direct requirement of the criterion. Both essays address environmental concerns appropriately for their respective experiments.\n\nOverall, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough, thoughtful, and scientifically mature approach to designing an investigation, particularly in its detailed background and its excellent description of methodological development.",
