  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is significantly better. Essay A demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor, planning, and attention to detail across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nBoth essays begin with strong, focused research questions. Essay A's question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is highly specific, naming the substance, source, and independent variable while using evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). Essay B's question is also good: \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\". However, the foundational quality of the essays diverges significantly from this point.\n\nEssay A's background is exemplary; it not only provides context on Vitamin B6 but meticulously explains the chemical principles underpinning the methodology. It justifies the need for UV-Vis spectrometry, the formation of a colored copper(II) complex using crystal field theory, and the innovative use of micelles to solve a precipitation problem observed during pilot studies. This demonstrates a deep understanding and a proactive, scientific approach to experimental design. In contrast, while Essay B provides a solid background on the \"salting in\" effect, it fails to address a critical flaw in its proposed methodology: using UV spectrophotometry at 210 nm, where the independent variable (MgCl\u2082 and its ions) is also likely to absorb, causing significant interference that is never acknowledged or controlled for.\n\nThis methodological weakness is the most significant differentiator. Essay A's methodology is sophisticated, appropriate, and clearly born from preliminary work, as detailed in its \"Development and pilot studies\" section. This section shows the student identifying and systematically solving problems like tablet impurities and precipitate formation, which is a hallmark of excellent exploration. Essay B's methodology, due to the unaddressed interference issue, is fundamentally questionable in its ability to produce valid data for the research question.\n\nFinally, Essay A thoroughly addresses all required procedural considerations. Its safety section is specific, citing hazards for individual chemicals like \"Copper(II) sulfate... can cause irritation to the eyes\" and \"SDS causes serious eye irritation\". It also includes explicit, albeit brief, sections for ethical and environmental considerations, noting \"avoid wastage\" and that \"Chemical waste must be disposed of... according to state regulations\". Essay B, on the other hand, provides only a general safety note and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical failure for an experimental investigation.",
