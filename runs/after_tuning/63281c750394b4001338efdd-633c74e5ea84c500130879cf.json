  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it presents a more methodologically sound and complete exploration. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its clear and focused research question: \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\". This question establishes a single, testable relationship. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is flawed because it introduces two independent variables (anion identity and temperature), making it unfocused and overly complex for a single investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its identification of variables and planning for control. It correctly identifies the independent variable as concentration and lists relevant controlled variables such as \"Purity of water\" and \"Time taken for heating\" with specific control methods. Essay B's variable section is confused; it incorrectly lists \"The Temperature of the System\" as an independent variable when, in its design, temperature is the dependent variable (the crystallization point).\n\nFinally, Essay A fulfills all safety, ethical, and environmental requirements for an experimental investigation. It explicitly addresses ethics (\"I did not use any materials from living organisms therefore there were no ethical precautions needed\") and environment (\"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician\"). Essay B includes safety precautions but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw. While Essay A could have been more specific about the range of concentrations tested, its overall structure, clarity, and completeness make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
