  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific inquiry and depth. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", is more detailed and focused than Essay A's, as it specifies the exact conditions and the precise metrics for measurement. While Essay A's background is good, Essay B provides a more thorough and focused scientific context, linking the BZ reaction to core chemical principles like redox, reaction rates, and collision theory, as seen in its discussion of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n\nA key differentiator is Essay B's dedicated \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section. Here, the student justifies the chosen methodology by detailing preliminary trials and challenges: \"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately... the built-in lux sensor in the data logger could determine the changes in colour.\" This demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design that is not present in Essay A. Furthermore, both essays have excellent and detailed variable tables and safety sections. However, Essay B's risk assessment is more specific regarding chemical hazards, noting that \"Potassium bromate is a... strong oxidizer, toxic if swallowed, and may cause cancer.\" Essay A's ethical consideration regarding the \"Use of edible materials\" is commendable, but Essay B's superior justification of its method and deeper background chemistry make it the stronger piece of work overall.",
