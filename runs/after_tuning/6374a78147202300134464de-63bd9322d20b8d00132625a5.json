  "reasoning": "Both essays effectively present their research questions. However, Essay A's RQ, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", provides more specific parameters (6g of zinc, 25 cm\u00b3 of CuSO4 solution) than Essay B's, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", which uses the less specific term \"different masses\".\n\nBoth essays provide relevant background information, but Essay A's explanation of the underlying chemical principles (enthalpy definition, reactivity series, redox reactions, Hess's Law) is more detailed and thorough.\n\nRegarding the methodology, both are appropriate for their respective questions. However, Essay A's procedure is slightly more detailed, including steps like allowing the solution to reach equilibrium before adding the reactant.\n\nFor the identification of variables, both essays clearly identify independent and dependent variables. Essay A also includes a comprehensive list of controlled variables like \"Room temperature\" and \"Pressure\", which is a stronger approach than what is presented in Essay B.\n\nBoth essays acknowledge safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A mentions specific disposal methods: \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain and threw the zinc granules in the trash can after cleaning it with water.\" It also correctly notes \"I took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions.\" Essay B also addresses these points, stating, \"Personal protection equipment should be worn... Ensure that the experiment is conducted in a well ventilated area... There are no ethical considerations for this experiment.\"\n\nOverall, while both are competent, Essay A demonstrates a slightly more rigorous and detailed approach to the experimental design and theoretical background.",
