  "reasoning": "Essay B is the superior essay, primarily due to its significantly more detailed methodology, in-depth background research that justifies the experimental design, and comprehensive treatment of safety and environmental considerations. Essay B's methodology is exemplary, detailing the preparation of reagents from scratch and the complex process of standardizing the sodium thiosulfate titrant before even beginning the analysis of the water samples. For example, it provides precise instructions like \"Took 2 grams of laboratory grade starch and 0.2 grams of Salicylic acid... and dissolved it in 100 ml of distilled water.\" This contrasts with Essay A's simpler, though still valid, liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Furthermore, Essay B's background research skillfully uses cited sources to establish a pollution gradient for its independent variable, directly linking the rationale to the experimental design. While Essay A's background on caffeine and dichloromethane is relevant, Essay B's demonstrates a higher level of synthesis.\n\nMost critically, Essay B excels in its risk assessment. It provides a chemical-by-chemical breakdown of hazards, such as \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer... Conduct the experiment in a fume hood.\" This is far more thorough than Essay A's generalized safety notes. Essay B also explicitly addresses environmental impact, stating, \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals to avoid release into the environment.\" Essay A completely omits any mention of environmental concerns, a serious flaw given its use of dichloromethane, a hazardous organic solvent. Although Essay A possesses a clearer, more focused research question (\"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea... using dichloromethane\"), Essay B's single poorly phrased question does not undermine the otherwise outstanding depth and rigor demonstrated throughout the rest of its Criterion B components.",
