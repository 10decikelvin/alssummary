  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is better. While Essay B provides a more detailed background section with thermodynamic calculations, its experimental design is fundamentally flawed and its safety/environmental considerations are problematic.\n\nEssay A presents a well-structured and viable investigation. Its research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear and focused. The methodology supports this question by planning to use various concentrations (\"dissolving different masses\") and plotting a graph to \"analyse the relationship.\" This approach is scientifically sound for determining a trend. The variables are correctly identified, and the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are addressed appropriately, including a proper waste disposal plan: \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician.\"\n\nConversely, Essay B, while having a more detailed background that includes calculations for Gibbs free energy to establish reaction feasibility, suffers from a critical flaw in its methodology. To answer its RQ, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change...\", it proposes testing only two concentrations: \"The concentration of copper (II) sulphate solution was shifted from 0.5M to 1.0M\". Investigating a relationship or trend with only two data points is insufficient and scientifically weak. Furthermore, the essay contains a significant error in its environmental protocol, stating, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain,\" which is an unsafe and environmentally irresponsible practice for heavy metal solutions. Lastly, its hypothesis section is confusing, introducing an untested variable (surface area) and presenting unclear H\u2081/H\u2080 statements.\n\nUltimately, Essay A's robust and appropriate methodology, which is central to Criterion B, combined with its correct handling of safety and environmental protocols, makes it a superior exploration despite Essay B's more thorough background information.",
