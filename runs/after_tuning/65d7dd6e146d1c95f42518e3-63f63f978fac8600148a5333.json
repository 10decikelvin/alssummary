  "reasoning": "Both essays provide a strong foundation with clear, focused research questions and relevant background information. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior experimental design and a more comprehensive approach to data analysis and evaluation. For example, Essay A's procedure explicitly mentions creating calibration curves and specifies concentrations, stating \"Prepare a calibration curve by serial diluting a 0.1M stock solution of copper (II) sulphate to create standards of 0.01M, 0.02M, 0.03M, 0.04M, and 0.05M concentrations.\" In contrast, Essay B's methodology, while generally sound, is less detailed and lacks this crucial step for quantitative analysis, merely stating \"The solutions would then be diluted as necessary.\" Furthermore, Essay A's evaluation section is more robust, not only identifying weaknesses but also suggesting specific, well-reasoned improvements like using a higher concentration of the adsorbate. While both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns, the superior experimental design and more rigorous data analysis plan in Essay A make it the stronger of the two.",
