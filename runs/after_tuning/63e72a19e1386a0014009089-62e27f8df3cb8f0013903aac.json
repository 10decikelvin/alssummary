  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong, focused, and measurable research questions with specified variables and ranges. Essay B's question, \"What is the activation energy... of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\", is slightly more sophisticated as it aims to derive a kinetic parameter rather than just describe a relationship. Essay A's background information is good, explaining the chemistry of dissolved oxygen and the Winkler method, but Essay B's is more thorough, directly linking reaction kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation to its specific methodology. Both provide clear, step-by-step procedures. However, Essay B's methodology is superior due to its inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies the chosen conditions and procedural modifications. The most significant difference lies in the safety considerations. Essay B provides an excellent, detailed table outlining specific chemical hazards and corresponding mitigation strategies, including environmental disposal: \"Do not wash down the sink as it may be hazardous to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\" In stark contrast, Essay A presents a heading for \"SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\" but leaves the corresponding table completely blank, which is a critical omission for an experimental investigation involving multiple chemicals. This failure to address safety, combined with the more developed methodology and background in Essay B, makes it the clearly superior submission.",
