  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A, primarily due to its exceptionally detailed methodology and its comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are critical components of an experimental investigation. Essay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration,\" is highly specific, outlining the independent variable range, the dependent variables, and the exact techniques used. Its methodology is meticulous, including separate, detailed procedures for standardizing chemical solutions before use, which indicates a high level of planning and chemical understanding. Most importantly, Essay B explicitly and thoughtfully addresses all safety risks in a detailed table, ethical considerations (\"oil which was used...was not either wasted or used in excess\"), and environmental impact (\"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines\").\n\nIn contrast, while Essay A presents a competent investigation with a clear research question and a logical procedure, it falls short in key areas. Its safety section is brief and somewhat generic, stating standard precautions like \"Lab coat and gloves were worn.\" More significantly, Essay A entirely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. For an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal, this is a major flaw. While Essay A's control of variables is well-documented in a table, Essay B's methodology and exhaustive risk assessment demonstrate a far deeper and more thorough approach to the scientific process, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
