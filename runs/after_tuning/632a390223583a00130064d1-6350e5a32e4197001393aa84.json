  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The final decision is that Essay A is superior. This is primarily due to its highly detailed, well-controlled, and clear experimental design, which is significantly more rigorous than that of Essay B.\n\n**1. Research Question and Background:**\nEssay A presents a more focused and specific research question: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". It clearly quantifies the levels of the independent variable. Essay B's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources...\", is less specific as it doesn't define the range of concentrations or the water sources, and it introduces a second independent variable (water source) that complicates the investigation. Both essays provide relevant background information, with Essay A thoroughly explaining the physics of Young's Modulus and Essay B detailing the chemistry of the Winkler method.\n\n**2. Methodology and Variables:**\nThis is the area of greatest difference. Essay A's methodology is meticulous, providing a step-by-step guide that is easily replicable. It excels in its identification and control of variables, using a detailed table to explain not only *what* will be controlled (e.g., \"Amount of time on Bunsen Burner\"), but *how* it will be controlled (\"120 seconds, measured with a timer\") and *why* this is important (\"to ensure that a similar amount of water evaporates from all samples\"). It even identifies and discusses uncontrolled variables. In contrast, Essay B's methodology lacks crucial detail, stating vaguely to \"Repeat steps 1 to step 5 for the different masses\" without specifying these masses. The control of variables is also less detailed, and the conflation of two independent variables (NaCl concentration and water source) represents a significant flaw in the experimental design.\n\n**3. Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:**\nBoth essays address these aspects. Essay A's risk assessment is well-structured in a table and includes a particularly thoughtful ethical consideration: \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted... We must be conscious of the materials used\". Essay B provides a satisfactory list of safety precautions relevant to its chemicals (\"Sulphuric acid is very corrosive\") and addresses environmental disposal (\"acids will be disposed after neutralisation\"). However, its ethical consideration is generic (\"No animal or human being was harmed\").\n\nOverall, Essay A demonstrates a much higher level of planning, precision, and critical thinking in its experimental design (Criterion B). The clarity of the research question, the rigor of the methodology, and the thoroughness of the variable control make it a significantly stronger piece of work.",
