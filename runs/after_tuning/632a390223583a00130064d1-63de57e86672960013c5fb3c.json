  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work for Criterion B, but Essay B demonstrates a slightly superior level of scientific depth and methodological rigor.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is commendable for its clarity and specificity regarding the independent variable's range. The background information correctly defines key concepts like Young's Modulus, and its methodology is detailed, incorporating modern technology like LabQuest 2 and Tracker software to enhance accuracy. Its variables section is thorough, notably including a table for uncontrolled variables, which shows a strong awareness of experimental limitations. The safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are also well-handled; the ethical point that \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\" is particularly thoughtful.\n\nHowever, Essay B edges ahead in several areas. Its research question is exceptionally precise: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". The background information is more scientifically robust, incorporating relevant chemical half-equations (e.g., \"\\( C u_{(\\mathrm{s})} \\rightarrow C u^{2+}(\\mathrm{aq})+2 e^{-} \\)\") and citing previous studies to contextualize the investigation. The methodology is meticulously planned, including a detailed table of measurement uncertainties. Furthermore, Essay B provides an excellent justification for its choice of independent variable range, stating, \"...websites centred around electroplating advised that 2 to 6 volts are the most acceptable...For this investigation, their advice will be explored but also challenged...\". Finally, its environmental section offers more specific disposal instructions for the chemicals used, such as noting that \"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\".\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is very strong, Essay B is superior due to its deeper scientific background, more rigorous methodological planning (including uncertainties and justification for the IV range), and more specific environmental considerations.",
