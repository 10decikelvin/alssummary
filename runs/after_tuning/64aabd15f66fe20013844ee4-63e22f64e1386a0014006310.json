  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of quality across several key elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, Essay B's is significantly more complex and detailed. It poses a two-part question: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)... and the enthalpy change of combustion... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary)... between isomeric alcohols?\". This specifies the exact range of the independent variable and introduces a sophisticated comparison between isomers. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid... using acid-base titration...\", is clear and focused but lacks the same level of analytical depth and specificity.\n\nSecond, while both essays have appropriate methodologies and well-defined variables, Essay B's treatment of safety is far superior. As both are experimental investigations, this is a critical component. Essay B provides a detailed table outlining specific risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" and \"Handling a heated calorimeter\" with corresponding, concrete protections such as \"Have a fire blanket and a fire extinguisher nearby and accessible.\" Essay A's safety section is minimal, simply stating \"Gloves are not necessary... No other special safety precautions are required,\" which is an oversimplification and shows less engagement with potential hazards.\n\nFinally, the background information in Essay B is more tightly linked to its complex research question, thoroughly explaining homologous series, isomers, and classifications, which are central to the investigation. Essay A's background is relevant, but Essay B's provides a stronger theoretical foundation for its more ambitious inquiry. Although both essays neglect to explicitly address ethical and environmental considerations, Essay B's superior research question, deeper background, and significantly more thorough safety analysis make it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
