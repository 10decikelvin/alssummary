  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all evaluated elements of Criterion B. The core strength of Essay B begins with its research question: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This question is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, specifying the independent variable's range, the dependent variable, the biosorbent, and the precise method of quantification. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is vague and lacks the specificity required for a high-quality investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is comprehensive and directly supports the experimental design, thoroughly explaining biosorption, the chemistry of orange peels, and the rationale for the chosen acidic pH range, noting that \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4\". Essay A's background on buffer chemistry is relevant but less focused and organized. The methodology in Essay B is a model of scientific rigor, including preliminary trials to justify choices (\"On varying contact times... I realised that there were minimal differences... Hence, 30 minutes was used as the default duration\") and a logical, repeatable procedure. Essay A's procedure is confusingly structured with out-of-order numbering (e.g., section \u2464 precedes section \u2462), making it difficult to follow.\n\nFinally, and most critically for these experimental investigations, Essay B fully addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It provides specific instructions for waste disposal (\"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\") and explicitly states that \"No ethical concerns were raised\". Essay A, however, has a critically flawed safety section that identifies a hazard for acetic acid but fails to describe how the risk will be minimized and completely omits any mention of the hazards of NaOH, or any environmental or ethical considerations. This complete omission is a major weakness that, combined with its weaker foundations, places it well below Essay B in quality.",
