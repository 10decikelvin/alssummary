  "reasoning": "Essay B is better as it demonstrates a higher level of personal engagement, chemical insight, and methodological rigor. While Essay A presents a competent and well-structured investigation, Essay B excels in the depth of its planning and justification. Essay A's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear and appropriate. It is supported by a good background and a particularly strong controlled variables table. However, Essay B's research question is more specific and detailed: \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\". This added detail signals a more thoughtfully designed experiment.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B shows greater personal input and critical thinking in its design. The author explicitly justifies their approach, stating, \"I was curious to see how I could alter the concept of rate to variate from standard practice,\" which demonstrates intellectual curiosity beyond simply following a standard procedure. The control of variables in Essay B is also more sophisticated; for instance, it addresses the \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" by specifying a procedure (\"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure\") which shows a deep understanding of factors affecting heterogeneous catalysis. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental sections are exemplary. The safety section specifies that \"3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution was used\" to reduce risk and cites an external source (CLEAPPS), while the environmental section thoughtfully connects the procedure to the \"12 Principles of Green Chemistry\". In contrast, Essay A's treatment of these sections, while correct, is more generic. Therefore, Essay B's superior detail, personal engagement, and sophisticated scientific thinking make it the better submission.",
