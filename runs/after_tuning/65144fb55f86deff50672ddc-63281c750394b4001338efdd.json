  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key elements of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally detailed and focused research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (kJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This question precisely defines the independent variable (specific ions), dependent variable (d-orbital splitting energy with units), and the exact method of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this high level of specificity regarding the range of concentrations or measurement parameters.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background section provides a thorough and relevant theoretical foundation, explaining complex concepts like d-orbital splitting, the spectrochemical series, and ligand exchange reactions, directly linking them to the investigation. Essay B's background is adequate, defining specific heat capacity, but it is less detailed and relies on an analogy to a different salt. Both investigations are experimental. Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are specific and justified; for example, it states, \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life and is considered a pollutant,\" providing a clear reason for careful disposal. Essay B's considerations are more generic, such as, \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician,\" which fails to explain the specific environmental impact of the waste. While Essay B presents a competent investigation, Essay A's depth, precision, and clear mastery of the underlying chemical principles make it the stronger submission.",
