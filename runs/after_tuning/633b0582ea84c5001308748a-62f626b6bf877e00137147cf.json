  "reasoning": "The two essays represent different investigation types: Essay A is a data-based investigation, while Essay B is an experimental one. Essay A is significantly better as it presents a complete and coherent exploration, which is a core requirement of Criterion B. Its strength begins with a well-contextualized introduction that logically leads to its research questions: \"1. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion? 2. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its boiling point?\". This is supported by an extensive, relevant background section that explains key concepts like intermolecular forces and enthalpy of combustion, directly linking them to the research questions. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is clear and appropriate for a data-based study, explicitly identifying its independent variable (\"the number of carbons in a chain\"), dependent variables (\"enthalpy of combustion...boiling point\"), and controlled variables (\"only linear primary alcohols\"). It also names its reliable data sources, such as the \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook\".\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is fundamentally incomplete. While its research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is focused, the essay completely lacks any background information. There is no explanation of complexometric titration, EDTA, or the chemistry of calcium in milk, leaving the reader without the necessary scientific context. The methodology section is merely a procedural list (e.g., \"Add 15 drops of Eriochrome Black T to the milk sample\") rather than a full methodology that justifies the choice of procedure and explains how variables will be controlled. Although Essay B includes a detailed and appropriate risk assessment, noting that \"EDTA...when applied to the skin solution are very corrosive\" and to \"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately\", this strength cannot compensate for the critical omission of the background and a properly detailed methodology. Ultimately, Essay A demonstrates a far superior understanding of the scientific process by providing a well-researched, justified, and complete investigative plan.",
