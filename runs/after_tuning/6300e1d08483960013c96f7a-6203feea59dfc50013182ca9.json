  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A for Criterion B. While both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's is more detailed and specific, outlining the dependent variable, independent variable, timeframe, and measurement technique directly within the question: \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\". Essay A's question is good but less comprehensive. Furthermore, Essay B's background information provides a more thorough chemical foundation, detailing the complex redox reactions of the Winkler method with full equations, which is a higher level of engagement than Essay A's correct but more fundamental explanation of freezing point depression.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and experimental design. Essay B presents a complex, sound, and appropriate methodology (the Winkler titration) to answer its research question. In contrast, Essay A contains a critical methodological flaw. Its background correctly identifies the number of ions as the key factor in freezing point depression, yet the method states to \"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\". Using equal masses instead of equal moles for different compounds (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, MgCl2) means the primary variable of interest\u2014the number of ions\u2014is not being compared on an equivalent basis, which fundamentally undermines the investigation's validity.\n\nFinally, Essay B excels in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are completely absent in Essay A. Essay B includes a detailed table listing specific chemical hazards, such as H\u2082SO\u2084 causing \"Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations,\" and general precautions like wearing gloves and goggles. It also explicitly addresses waste disposal: \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory, hence abiding by environmental considerations of disposal.\" Essay A's total omission of these required sections for an experimental investigation is a major failure. Therefore, due to its superior research question, sound methodology, and comprehensive safety and environmental considerations, Essay B is the much stronger piece of work.",
