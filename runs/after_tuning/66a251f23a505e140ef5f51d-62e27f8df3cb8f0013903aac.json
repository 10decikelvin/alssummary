  "reasoning": "Both essays present exceptionally strong Criterion B sections, making the decision very close. Essay A's research question, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\", is highly specific, detailing exact temperatures and concentrations. Its background information is comprehensive, connecting the experiment to Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Le Chatelier's principle, providing a deep theoretical foundation. The methodology is robust, particularly its use of preliminary trials to identify and solve a problem (absorbance of Fe\u00b3\u207a ions) by adding nitric acid, demonstrating a thoughtful and iterative experimental design process.\n\nEssay B also features an excellent research question: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\". Its background information thoroughly explains the reaction mechanism and the Arrhenius equation, directly linking the methodology to the research goal. The variable tables are exemplary, and the tabular format for safety, environmental, and ethical considerations is very clear and effective. However, the methodology itself, while detailed, reveals weaknesses that were identified but not fully resolved in the design stage. For instance, the procedure notes, \"the caps of cuvettes were not placed during the experiment...there was not enough time,\" and the evaluation later confirms this could lead to \"reactant evaporation\" and \"increase temperature loss.\"\n\nUltimately, Essay A is marginally superior. While both essays are outstanding, Essay A's methodology appears more rigorously controlled from the outset. Its preliminary work led to a proactive improvement in the procedure (adding nitric acid), whereas Essay B's preliminary work primarily identified limitations that were accepted into the final procedure. This proactive refinement of the method in Essay A demonstrates a slightly higher level of exploration and design.",
