  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay B is better. Both essays present viable experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a greater depth of scientific exploration, which is the core of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is superior because it is highly specific, not only identifying the variables but also explicitly stating the analytical method to be used. Essay A's two-part research question is clear but less detailed in its construction. Furthermore, Essay B's background section is significantly stronger; it provides personal context and delves into complex chemical principles like the \"diverse ion effect,\" \"charge density,\" and \"ionic atmosphere,\" showing a sophisticated level of research. In contrast, Essay A's background competently defines standard concepts like homologous series and combustion but lacks the same depth.\n\nIn terms of methodology and variables, both essays are strong, but Essay B's approach using spectrophotometry and a calibration curve represents a more advanced experimental design than the standard calorimetry in Essay A. Essay B's controlled variables table is also exemplary, as it explains not just *how* but also *why* each variable is controlled, as seen in its entry for temperature: \"Solubility increases with increase in temperature as intermolecular forces are broken easily.\" Essay A's table is good but less comprehensive in its justifications.\n\nThe primary strength of Essay A is its detailed safety section, which clearly outlines risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" and \"Handling a heated calorimeter\" with specific mitigation strategies. Essay B's safety section is present but significantly more brief and generic. However, both essays completely fail to address ethical and environmental considerations, which is a notable weakness for experimental work. Despite Essay A's superior safety table, Essay B's excellence in its research question, background knowledge, and methodological sophistication makes it the stronger overall submission for Criterion B.",
