  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the core components of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\", is detailed, specifying the analytical method and number of samples, although it is slightly flawed by the confusing inclusion of \"secondary data\" when the methodology is experimental. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is vague and lacks specificity regarding which salts or temperature ranges will be investigated.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A provides a deeply contextualized and relevant background, linking the investigation to local pollution issues and thoroughly explaining the chemical principles of the Winkler method with full equations. Essay B's background is superficial, offering only a textbook definition of solubility (\"Solubility has been defined as 'the analytical composition of a saturated solution...'\") without exploring the specific chemical theories (e.g., lattice enthalpy, hydration enthalpy) that would justify its hypothesis. The methodological section of Essay A is exemplary in its detail, providing a replicable procedure with specific quantities like, \"Dissolved 91 grams or 0.602 moles of Manganese Sulfate...in 100 ml of distilled water,\" which is a stark contrast to Essay B's vague instructions, such as, \"The desired weights were measured,\" which omits the actual weights needed to replicate the experiment.\n\nCritically, Essay A correctly identifies its independent (\"4 different Water bodies\") and dependent (\"Amount of Dissolved Oxygen\") variables, while Essay B displays fundamental confusion, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and \"Solubility of salts\" as a dependent variable, which is circular and incorrect. Finally, Essay A presents a robust, specific risk assessment for an experimental investigation, noting hazards like \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\" and explicitly addressing environmental disposal. Essay B's safety precautions are generic (\"The salt used in this experiment can cause irritation...\"), and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, a significant failure for an experimental IA.",
