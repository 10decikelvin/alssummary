  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay A's RQ, 'What is the effect of the percentage of paraffin wax replaced with stearin on the heat of combustion of a candle?', is more focused and detailed than Essay B's 'How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?'. Essay A provides a more thorough background, explaining the properties of both waxes, although neither essay delves deeply into the scientific principles behind their research question. Both demonstrate a basic understanding of methodology, but Essay A is more specific about the equipment and procedure, whereas Essay B's methodology is less clear, especially regarding the 'oxygen probe'. Essay A's handling of variables is superior; it correctly identifies and discusses the control of variables, whereas Essay B's table is somewhat confusing. Both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, but Essay A's are more specific and relevant to the chemicals used. The crucial factor is the analysis of results and reflection on limitations. Essay A provides a clearer analysis, including a graph comparing experimental to theoretical values and a thoughtful discussion of limitations and their impact on the results. Essay B's analysis is more superficial, and its discussion of errors and limitations is less detailed. Therefore, Essay A is the stronger submission due to its clearer research focus, more detailed methodology, and more insightful analysis and evaluation.",
