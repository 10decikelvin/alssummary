  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This question is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, specifying the exact temperatures, reactants, and concentrations. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is broad and lacks specificity regarding which salts or temperature ranges will be investigated.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B provides extensive, relevant, and focused background information that masterfully links equilibrium, Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Beer-Lambert's law directly to the investigation. Essay A's background is far more superficial, offering little more than a basic definition of solubility. The methodological planning in Essay B is also superior; it details preliminary experiments, presents a comprehensive table of controlled variables explaining both *why* and *how* they are controlled, and outlines a precise, two-part procedure. Essay A's methodology is plausible, but its variable identification is confused, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and providing a minimal list of controlled variables.\n\nFinally, Essay B excels in its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It identifies specific hazards for each chemical, such as \"Potassium thiocyanate...Contact with acids liberates toxic gas,\" and provides specific disposal guidance: \"iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\" It also explicitly addresses ethical considerations. Essay A, an experimental investigation, provides only a generic safety warning and critically omits any mention of ethical or environmental factors, which is a major deficiency.",
