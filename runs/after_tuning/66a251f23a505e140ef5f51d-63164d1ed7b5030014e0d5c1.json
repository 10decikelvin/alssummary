  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it exhibits a higher degree of scientific rigor and depth across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact temperatures and reactant concentrations: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This contrasts with Essay B's question, which, while good, is less specific. Essay A's background is also far more comprehensive, grounding the investigation in advanced thermodynamic principles like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation (\"To understand the quantitative impact of temperature on \\( K_{\\mathrm{c}} \\), Van't Hoff's equation can be considered...\"), whereas Essay B's background is more descriptive.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is meticulous. It details preliminary experiments to refine its procedure and justifies the inclusion of nitric acid, showing a thoughtful and iterative design process. Its controlled variables are presented in an exemplary table, explaining both *why* and *how* each variable is controlled. Essay B's methodology is appropriate but lacks this precision; for example, it instructs to \"Add 50 ml of distilled water periodically during the crushing process,\" which is less controlled than the precise volumetric measurements in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay A's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors is more thorough. While both address safety, Essay A provides specific environmental disposal guidance, stating chemicals like \"iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised,\" which is a critical detail for an experimental investigation. Essay B dismisses this aspect with a simple \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is a significant weakness for an investigation using iodine.",
