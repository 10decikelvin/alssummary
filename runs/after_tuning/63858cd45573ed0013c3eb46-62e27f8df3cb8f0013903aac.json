  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and detail across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-formulated and specific: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This level of detail, including concentrations, variable ranges, and measurement techniques, far exceeds that of Essay A's question, which, while clear, lacks this specificity. Furthermore, Essay B's background information is more comprehensive, effectively linking the reaction mechanism, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation to create a robust theoretical framework for the investigation.\n\nWhile Essay A presents a valid experimental design, its methodology of measuring foam height in a graduated cylinder is less precise than Essay B's use of a colorimeter to track absorbance changes over time. Essay B also provides more thorough justification for its chosen variables and procedure, referencing preliminary trials to explain choices like the upper temperature limit: \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data in the colorimeter, so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" Both essays adequately address safety, but Essay B's breakdown of hazards and mitigation for each specific chemical (e.g., \"Pure Propanone ('Acetone') - Highly flammable, vapour/air mixtures are explosive... To mitigate these risks, do not heat directly.\") is more detailed than Essay A's general statements. Essay B also integrates environmental considerations by specifying disposal for each chemical used. Although Essay A correctly has separate sections for ethical and environmental concerns, the overall quality, depth, and precision of Essay B's exploration make it the stronger submission.",
