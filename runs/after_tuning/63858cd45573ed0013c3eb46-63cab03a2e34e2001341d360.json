  "reasoning": "Essay A is better because it presents a much more coherent and well-designed scientific investigation from its foundation. The primary strength of Essay A is its clear, focused, and detailed research question: \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\". This RQ is directly supported by a relevant background section explaining heterogeneous catalysis and the function of active sites, and it leads to a logical and appropriate methodology. In contrast, Essay B's research question is fundamentally flawed and internally contradictory: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\". The phrase \"by comparing secondary data\" directly conflicts with the detailed experimental methodology that follows, which describes a primary data collection process. This lack of clarity and focus at the outset significantly weakens the entire investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's identification and justification of variables are superior. Its variable table clearly outlines the independent, dependent, and controlled variables with specific justifications for how they will be managed, such as controlling the surface area of the catalyst by \"using 200 turns at medium pressure\" with a mortar and pestle. Essay B correctly identifies its variables but presents them in a less organized way and omits justifications for control within its variable section. While Essay B provides a very thorough safety assessment for numerous hazardous chemicals (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\"), Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental sections are more complete. Essay A explicitly addresses all three components, noting for environmental concerns that waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal,\" which is more specific than Essay B's generic statement. Ultimately, Essay A's clear purpose and thoughtful experimental design make it a stronger example of Criterion B.",
