  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused and detailed research question, its deeply relevant scientific background, and its meticulous and well-justified methodology. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is exemplary; it is specific about the substance, its commercial source, and uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). In contrast, Essay B's question is less focused by conflating two variables: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources...?\". The inclusion of \"different water sources\" weakens the investigation into the effect of NaCl concentration.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is excellent, providing detailed chemical theory (solubility, thermal decomposition, crystal field theory) that directly justifies the complex methodology. For example, it explains why a colored complex is necessary for UV-Vis spectrometry: \"when pyridoxine hydrochloride is dissolved in water, it forms a clear, colourless solution...For UV-Vis spectrometry to be applied, the pyridoxine must be complexed with a d-block transition metal\". Essay B's background, while outlining the Winkler method, critically fails to provide the scientific principles explaining *why* salinity affects dissolved oxygen, a major omission.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A showcases significant personal engagement and problem-solving through its pilot studies, such as finding a way to deal with tablet impurities (\"To remove these contaminants from the solution, I decided to filter it\") and precipitate (\"To address this issue, I chose to implement the concept micelles formation\"). Its list of controlled variables is comprehensive and thoughtful. Essay B's methodology lacks crucial detail (e.g., the specific masses of NaCl to be used) and its control of variables is insufficient for an experiment using complex environmental samples. While both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, with Essay B providing slightly more detail on waste disposal (\"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\"), Essay A's profound strength in its foundational scientific planning and justification makes it the far better piece of work.",
