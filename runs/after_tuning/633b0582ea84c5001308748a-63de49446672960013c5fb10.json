  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger across all key aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is significantly more detailed and focused than Essay A's two simpler questions (\"Does the number of carbon atoms...affect...?\"). Essay B specifies the substance, its source, and uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\"), which is a hallmark of a high-quality investigation. Essay A's questions are clear but lack this specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology showcases a higher level of personal engagement and scientific rigor. The inclusion of a \"Development and pilot studies\" section, where the student addresses challenges like insoluble tablet components and precipitate formation, is exemplary. This section details problem-solving steps, such as deciding to \"filter it using a Buchner funnel\" and to \"implement the concept micelles formation\" to stabilize the complex. In contrast, Essay A's methodology is appropriate for a data-based study but is limited to identifying reliable databases (\"ChemPub and Chemeo\") and standardizing data formats, which demonstrates less investigative depth.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is also superior, as it not only explains the chemistry of Vitamin B6 but also justifies the complex analytical method (UV-Vis spectrometry) by explaining crystal field theory and the need to create a colored complex. While Essay A's background on intermolecular forces and combustion is relevant, Essay B's background is more deeply integrated with its complex experimental design. Finally, as an experimental investigation, Essay B correctly provides specific and thorough safety (\"Copper(II) sulfate...can cause irritation\"), ethical (\"minimal necessary quantity\"), and environmental (\"disposed of in the correct bin\") considerations. Essay A, being data-based, appropriately omits these, but the quality and necessity of their inclusion in Essay B make it a more complete fulfillment of the criterion for an experimental IA.",
