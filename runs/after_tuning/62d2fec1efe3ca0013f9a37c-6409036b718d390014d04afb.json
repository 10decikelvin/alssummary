  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A due to its significantly more focused and detailed research question, a more sophisticated and well-justified methodology, and a more thorough engagement with the scientific context and safety considerations.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", is exemplary. It precisely defines the independent variable with specific values and uncertainties, and clearly states how the dependent variables will be measured. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is clear but lacks this level of operational detail within the question itself.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is far more robust. The author provides a detailed rationale for their choice of equipment in the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, explaining why they rejected visual observation and a standard colorimeter in favor of a lux sensor for data logging. This demonstrates a thoughtful and scientific approach to experimental design. Essay A, however, relies on measuring the rate \"by the naked eye,\" a subjective method that introduces significant potential for random error, a weakness the student acknowledges in their evaluation: \"Relying on the naked eye may cause random errors.\"\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information connects the BZ reaction to real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia, showing deeper personal engagement and a stronger command of the topic's significance. The control of variables in Essay B is also more comprehensive, with a detailed table explaining not just what is controlled but precisely why and how. Finally, while both essays address safety, Essay B's environmental consideration is more proactive, stating, \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint,\" which shows a higher level of critical thought than simply listing disposal methods. Essay A is a competent investigation, but Essay B excels in its planning, execution, and contextual understanding.",
