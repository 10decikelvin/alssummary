  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong research questions and methodologies. Essay B's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\", is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying the independent variable with precise levels and uncertainty. Essay A's research question is also strong, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration,\" clearly outlining the variables and methods. Both essays provide relevant background information and a detailed, appropriate methodology.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior due to its comprehensive and explicit treatment of all aspects of Criterion B. Its table of controlled variables includes columns for \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\", which is excellent practice. Crucially, Essay A provides a detailed and specific risk assessment, noting hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and providing corresponding precautions like \"Keep such liquid away from fire and hot objects.\" It also explicitly addresses ethical considerations, stating \"There were no ethical issues in this investigation,\" and environmental issues, explaining that \"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay B completely fails to address these critical components. While it has a heading for \"SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES,\" the table that follows is entirely empty, containing only headers. There is no mention of the hazards associated with concentrated sulfuric acid or other reagents used. Furthermore, it makes no mention of ethical considerations. This omission is a significant flaw in an experimental investigation. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and thorough approach to experimental design and safety.",
