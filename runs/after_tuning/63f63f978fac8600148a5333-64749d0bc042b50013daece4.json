  "reasoning": "While both essays present competent explorations, Essay A is superior due to its focused research question, excellent scientific rationale that directly informs the methodology, and clear evidence of a well-developed, iterative experimental design.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying salinity... and temperature... affect the amount of dissolved oxygen,\" is specific but overly ambitious by investigating two independent variables. While the background information is solid and the S/E/E section is well-organized, the scope of the investigation is a significant weakness, suggesting a less focused project. The methodology section attempts to address this by describing two separate experiments, which conflicts with the combined nature implied by the RQ.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a perfectly scoped and highly focused research question: \"How does varying pH... under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels...?\" The key strength of Essay A lies in its deep and personally engaged background section, which justifies the chosen pH range with precise chemical reasoning. The student notes that \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4... Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding that goes beyond simply choosing a variable; it shows proactive problem-solving that defines the experimental boundaries. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by clear preliminary trials, which were used to determine key parameters like adsorption time (\"minimal differences in percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions upon contact for 30 minutes and 40 minutes. Hence, 30 minutes was used\"). This iterative approach, combined with the superior justification for its experimental scope, makes Essay A a more scientifically mature and well-executed exploration.",
