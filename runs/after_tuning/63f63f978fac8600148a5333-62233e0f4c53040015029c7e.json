  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it presents a far more thorough, focused, and well-structured investigation. Its research question is a model of clarity and specificity: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This question clearly defines the independent variable with its range, the dependent variable, the system under investigation, and the precise method of measurement. The background information is comprehensive, relevant, and scientifically detailed, covering everything from the chemical composition of orange peels to the principles of biosorption and UV-vis spectrophotometry. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is logical, includes insightful preliminary trials, and considers potential issues like precipitation, which it addresses by centrifuging samples. Crucially, for an experimental investigation, it explicitly and specifically addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, stating \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area to prevent contamination of drainage water\" and \"No ethical concerns were raised as no living organisms were harmed\".\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is significantly weaker in all core areas. Its research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is vague and poorly phrased. It fails to clearly articulate that buffer capacity is the property being investigated. The methodology section is extremely disorganized and difficult to follow, with procedural steps numbered out of sequence (e.g., section \"\u2460 Prepare NaCH\u2083COO\" is followed by \"\u2464 Set up the burette\"). Most importantly, Essay B completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical failure for a lab-based investigation involving chemical waste. While it does mention safety hazards for acetic acid, the absence of the other two components severely undermines its quality. Therefore, Essay A's combination of a precise research question, deep background research, a well-planned methodology, and complete adherence to safety, ethical, and environmental protocols makes it the clear winner.",
