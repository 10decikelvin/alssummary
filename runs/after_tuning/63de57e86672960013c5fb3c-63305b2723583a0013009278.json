  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B, primarily due to its significantly more thorough and professional approach to the experimental design and safety considerations. Both essays present clear and focused research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", while Essay B asks, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\". Both are well-defined. However, Essay A's methodology and control of variables are far more detailed and rigorous. For example, to control the distance between electrodes, Essay A states, \"the cathode will be attached to wooden splint that is marked with either end of the beaker to ensure the same distance between the electrodes in each trial,\" which is a much more precise method than Essay B's simple statement, \"The same beaker was used.\" The most significant difference lies in the handling of safety and environmental protocols. Essay A provides a detailed 'Risk Assessment' section, noting specific hazards like \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive and viscous liquid\" and outlining disposal methods for copper sulphate. In stark contrast, Essay B's sections for Safety and Environmental considerations are completely blank, which is a major omission for any experimental science investigation. This demonstrates a lack of awareness and responsibility that is critical to scientific practice. While both essays present a competent understanding of the underlying chemistry, Essay A's meticulous planning, control of variables, and attention to safety make it a much stronger piece of scientific work.",
