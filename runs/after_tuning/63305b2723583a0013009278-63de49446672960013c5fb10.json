  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of the Exploration criterion. Essay A has a very clearly defined research question, stating the exact voltages to be tested: \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited...?\" Its methodology is clear and its discussion of safety and environmental concerns is adequate, referencing specific chemicals like \"zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic to aquatic organisms.\" Essay B, however, demonstrates a higher level of engagement and scientific thinking. Its research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6...?\" is focused and evaluative. The background information is more detailed, explaining not just the context but also the chemical principles behind the chosen methodology (UV-Vis spectrometry, complex formation). Most notably, Essay B includes a \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which shows significant preliminary work and problem-solving, such as finding an alternative to a hazardous dye and using micelles to prevent precipitation. This sophisticated approach to developing the procedure elevates Essay B above Essay A, which follows a more standard, albeit well-executed, experimental design.",
