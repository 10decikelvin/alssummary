  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations with clear research questions and appropriate methodologies. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of personal engagement, planning, and rigor in its experimental design, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is exceptionally well-focused, specifying the substance, its commercial source, and the independent variable. The background information is comprehensive, covering the chemistry of Vitamin B6, the rationale for using a specific analytical technique (UV-Vis spectrophotometry), the necessity of complexation for a colorless substance, and the theory behind it. Crucially, the \"Development and pilot studies\" section showcases a thoughtful and iterative approach to designing the method, addressing challenges like filtration of binders and precipitation of the complex, and researching solutions like micelle formation. This demonstrates a high degree of independent work and scientific thinking. The list of controlled variables is extensive and specific, and all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects are explicitly addressed.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is also clear and focused. The background appropriately discusses reaction rates, activation energy, and the Arrhenius equation. However, the methodology relies on a visual color change (\"determined by the naked eye\") to time the reaction, which is inherently less precise and more subjective than the spectrometric method used in Essay A. While the list of controlled variables is good, it is less comprehensive than Essay A's. For example, it overlooks the potential impact of using different burettes for different reagents. Furthermore, Essay B completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a required component of the criterion for an experimental investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A is superior due to its more sophisticated methodology, its detailed account of preliminary work that informed the final procedure, its more thorough consideration of controlled variables, and its complete fulfillment of the safety, ethical, and environmental requirements.",
