  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much deeper and more thorough exploration of its topic, excelling in every evaluated element of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is a model of clarity and specificity, precisely defining the independent variable range, the system under investigation, and the analytical technique. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is less focused and lacks specific parameters for the independent variable (i.e., the expiration dates).\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the background and rationale. Essay B provides extensive, well-referenced background information on biosorption, the chemical properties of orange peels, the effect of pH on the process, and a clear justification for choosing UV-vis spectrophotometry over titration. For instance, it correctly explains why the pH must be kept below 5.4: \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4...Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" Essay A's background is nearly non-existent, consisting of a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution.\" This fails to provide any necessary context for complexometric titration or the chemistry of calcium in milk.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is again far superior. It includes a section on preliminary trials to justify its parameters, a comprehensive table identifying and explaining the significance of independent, dependent, and multiple controlled variables, and a detailed, reproducible procedure. Essay A's methodology is a simple list of steps and critically omits any discussion or identification of controlled variables, a major flaw in experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B correctly and explicitly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, noting specific disposal requirements: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area.\" While Essay A has a reasonable risk assessment, it completely omits any ethical considerations and its environmental note is generic.",
