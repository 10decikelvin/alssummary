  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundational elements for Criterion B, including clear, focused, and appropriately detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid... using acid-base titration with... 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\" and Essay B asks, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea... using dichloromethane in a separating funnel.\" Both questions are specific about the method and substances used. Similarly, both essays provide relevant background information and feature excellent, well-structured tables for controlled variables that detail not just what is being controlled, but also how and why.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a superior approach to methodology and safety considerations. The experimental investigation in Essay B, involving liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane, is more complex than the acid-base titration in Essay A, and the methodology is clearly articulated. The most significant difference lies in the safety precautions. Essay B correctly identifies the specific hazards of its primary chemical, stating the need to \"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane as it can cause several skin issues and irritations\" and to \"Wear a mask for protection because dichloromethane causes several health issues if inhaled.\" In stark contrast, Essay A's safety section is dangerously dismissive, claiming, \"Gloves are not necessary for this experiment due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH Titre,\" and it completely omits any mention of eye protection, a fundamental requirement in any lab setting.\n\nWhile both essays fail to explicitly address environmental or ethical considerations\u2014a notable weakness, especially for Essay B's use of a halogenated organic solvent\u2014Essay B's competent and specific risk assessment for chemical handling makes it significantly stronger. Essay A's poor justification for omitting PPE is a critical flaw that undermines its overall quality. Therefore, despite shared strengths in the initial planning stages, Essay B is the better essay due to its more responsible and detailed consideration of experimental safety.",
