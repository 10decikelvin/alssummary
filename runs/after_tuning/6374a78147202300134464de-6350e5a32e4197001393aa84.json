  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "While both essays present competent experimental plans, Essay B is superior due to its greater detail and rigor across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is more detailed and specific than Essay A's, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change...\". Essay B clearly outlines multiple variables and conditions directly within the question. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is significantly more complex and thoroughly described, involving a multi-step Winkler titration and the comparative use of a DO probe. This is contrasted with Essay A's more standard calorimetry experiment. The most significant difference, however, lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides a highly specific and commendable list of safety precautions and disposal methods, stating \"Sulfuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin\" and that harmful chemicals will be \"disposed after neutralisation\". In contrast, Essay A's safety section is minimal, and its disposal plan (\"disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\") is environmentally questionable for a heavy metal salt. Overall, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough, thoughtful, and scientifically mature approach to experimental design.",
