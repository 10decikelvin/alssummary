  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary difference lies in the depth, specificity, and rigor of the experimental design. Essay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is significantly more focused and detailed than Essay A's, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", because it specifies the exact range of the independent variable. While both essays provide relevant background information, Essay B's is more comprehensive, defining key terms and providing the necessary physical equations for Young's Modulus.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B presents a far more meticulous and well-controlled plan. It details specific equipment like the \"Vernier LabQuest 2\" for precise data collection and its table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only listing variables like the \"Amount of Cornstarch\" but also justifying why they must be controlled (\"Having different amounts of cornstarch would mean that different samples have more or less to polymerize...\"). In contrast, Essay A correctly identifies its variables but imprecisely states the dependent variable is \"temperature difference\" when it is actually the calculated specific heat capacity. Furthermore, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are more insightful and specific; its ethical discussion on using \"edible materials for an experiment\" shows a higher level of reflection than Essay A's generic statement that \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\". Essay A presents a competent but standard investigation, whereas Essay B demonstrates a much higher level of planning, thoroughness, and scientific understanding.",
