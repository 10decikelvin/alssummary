  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B. Both essays begin with strong, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", providing excellent specificity on the variables and conditions. Essay B also presents a clear, two-part question: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\". However, the overall quality of exploration in Essay A surpasses Essay B, primarily due to its comprehensive treatment of all Criterion B elements.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. As both are experimental investigations, these sections are critical. Essay A provides detailed and specific sections for all three. For instance, its environmental section thoughtfully considers disposal methods: \"Sulphuric acid is highly corrosive...must be neutralized first then disposed of.\" It also explicitly addresses ethics, stating, \"There are no ethical issues to be considered...\". In stark contrast, Essay B includes a sufficient safety table but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation involving numerous organic chemicals.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology and background are more robust. The background connects scientific principles to a personal interest (jewellery making) and cites previous studies, demonstrating strong engagement. Its electroplating methodology is sound and appropriate for the research question. While Essay B's methodology is a standard calorimetry experiment, it is known to be fraught with significant systematic errors (like heat loss), a fact it acknowledges but does not mitigate in its design. Essay A's experimental design is better controlled and more likely to yield meaningful results. Therefore, due to its thoroughness across all aspects of the exploration criteria and a more robust experimental design, Essay A is the better essay.",
