  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it presents a more coherent and rigorously justified scientific exploration. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its background section, which perfectly establishes the theoretical and mathematical foundation for the entire investigation. It explicitly derives the necessary equations, stating, \"we can see that plotting a graph of t against 1/c is going to result in a straight line with a gradient of k,\" which directly justifies the proposed data collection and analysis method. In contrast, while Essay B has a more detailed research question (\"...calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\"), its background fails to explain *why* Beer-Lambert's Law is an appropriate method for measuring the solubility of Calcium Sulfate, creating a significant logical gap between the theory and the methodology.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A demonstrates a more complete approach to the investigation's context. Its methodology, involving quenching the reaction and back-titration, is complex but perfectly suited to answer the research question based on the provided background. Essay B's use of spectrophotometry is sophisticated, but its appropriateness is assumed rather than explained. Finally, Essay A provides a more thorough treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It mentions specific chemical hazards like \"Ethyl acetate is flammable\" and \"sodium hydroxide is corrosive,\" and provides a disposal method, whereas Essay B only addresses safety precautions (\"Lab coat and gloves were worn\") and omits any explicit mention of ethical or environmental concerns, which is a notable weakness for an experimental investigation. The comprehensive and logically sound structure of Essay A makes it a better example of Criterion B.",
