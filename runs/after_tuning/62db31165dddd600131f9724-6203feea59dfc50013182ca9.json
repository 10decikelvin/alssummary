  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it presents a complete and well-structured exploration, whereas Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is highly specific, outlining the variables, timeframe, and analytical technique directly. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail. Furthermore, Essay B provides a comprehensive methodology, a detailed table of controlled variables, and a thorough safety assessment, including a table of specific chemical risks like \"80% concentrated solution of H\u2082SO\u2084 | Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\". It also addresses environmental considerations, stating that waste was \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\". Essay A, while having a solid background section, completely fails to provide a methodology, a list of variables, or any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. This omission of entire essential sections makes it impossible to evaluate the experimental design and renders it a fundamentally flawed exploration. Therefore, Essay B's completeness and attention to detail across all aspects of Criterion B make it the unequivocally superior piece of work.",
