  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured experimental investigations. However, Essay B is superior due to its more detailed and comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core investigative framework, Essay B's research question is stronger. It asks, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\" This question is exemplary because it includes the evaluative phrase \"To what extent,\" specifies the exact levels of the independent variable, and names the measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's question is good but less focused, posing two separate questions: one about carbon chain length and another about isomeric classification. While Essay A's background is relevant, Essay B's is more thorough, providing the specific balanced chemical equation for the titration reaction: `C\u2086H\u2088O\u2086 + I\u2082 \u2192 C\u2086H\u2086O\u2086 + 2I\u207b`.\n\nSecond, both methodologies are appropriate and the variables are well-controlled. Essay A's procedure for calorimetry is standard and clear. Essay B's procedure is more detailed, including subsections for the preparation of the juices, the starch indicator, and the standard iodine solution, demonstrating a higher level of planning.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations where these sections are critical. Essay B explicitly addresses all three aspects. For ethics, it notes, \"the least possible amount of fruits was used and they were thoroughly squeezed to minimize the waste of such products.\" For environmental impact, it states, \"The heating plate used in the experiment could cause excessive energy consumption, so it was powered off and unplugged when it was not used.\" Essay A, despite having a header for \"Safety, Environment and Ethical Considerations,\" only addresses safety risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" and \"Handling a heated calorimeter,\" completely omitting any mention of ethical or environmental points. This omission represents a critical flaw in an otherwise solid exploration. Therefore, Essay B's complete and thoughtful handling of all required components makes it the better essay.",
