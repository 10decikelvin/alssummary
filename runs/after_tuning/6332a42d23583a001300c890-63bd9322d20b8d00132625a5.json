  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B in meeting the criteria for a well-designed scientific investigation. The research question in Essay A is not only clear but also specific, defining the relationship to be investigated (temperature's effect on reaction rate) and the method of quantification (calculating activation energy). Essay B's question is also clear, but lacks this level of scientific refinement. The background information provided in Essay A is thorough, connecting the experiment to core chemical concepts like collision theory and the Arrhenius equation, which is entirely missing in the excerpt from Essay B. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed, reproducible, and includes crucial details like specific quantities and concentrations, whereas Essay B's methodology section is incomplete. Critically, Essay A explicitly lists and defines independent, dependent, and controlled variables, demonstrating a clear understanding of experimental design. Essay B omits this crucial section. While both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns relevant to their experiments, Essay A's comprehensive and well-structured approach to the entire experimental design process makes it the stronger submission.",
