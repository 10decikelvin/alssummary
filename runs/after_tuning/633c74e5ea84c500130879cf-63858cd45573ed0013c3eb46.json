  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nThe primary strength of Essay B lies in its focused and detailed research question: \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\". This question is specific, identifying the exact chemical substances and the precise variables being measured. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad, attempting to investigate two independent variables without specifying the salts or temperature ranges.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is directly relevant and provides a strong theoretical foundation, explaining the role of \"active sites\" in heterogeneous catalysis, which justifies why varying the catalyst's mass is a meaningful investigation. Essay A's background is much more general. Essay B also excels in its identification and control of variables, presenting them in a clear table with justifications, including a thoughtful list of controlled variables like \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" and \"Mixing of MnO\u2082 and soap solution\". Essay A's variables section is confusing, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable rather than the type of anion.\n\nMost critically, Essay B demonstrates a comprehensive approach to safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It provides specific safety details for each chemical, stating \"Manganese dioxide is...harmful by inhalation\" and noting that \"3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution was used\" to reduce risk. It explicitly addresses ethics (\"no evident ethical considerations\") and environment (\"waste prevention in mind...collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\"). Essay A's treatment is weak; it offers only generic safety advice (\"use of surgical masks, gloves, and laboratory goggles\") and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental factors, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation.",
