  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong and well-structured Criterion B sections. Essay A's research question, \"How does an increase in ionic radii...of central metal ions...affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting...calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\", is excellent. It is highly specific, naming the independent variable (ionic radii of Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+), dependent variable (d-orbital splitting energy), and the method of determination (spectrophotometry). Similarly, Essay B's research question, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk...is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using...EDTA complexometric titration?\", is also exemplary in its detail and focus.\n\nBoth essays provide relevant and focused background information that establishes a clear theoretical basis for their respective investigations. Essay A effectively explains d-orbital splitting theory, while Essay B thoroughly covers complexometric titrations. The methodologies in both are appropriate for their research questions, with detailed steps and well-defined variables.\n\nThe primary distinction lies in the quality of their safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this analysis. Essay B has a very detailed safety section, clearly linking specific hazards to precautions. However, its ethical and environmental considerations are weaker. It dismisses ethics by stating, \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved,\" and its environmental point focuses on not wasting the milk sample, which is tangential to the chemical waste produced. Conversely, Essay A provides specific and relevant considerations for all three aspects. For instance, it addresses environmental impact by stating, \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life and is considered a pollutant \u2014 Only use necessary amount...and use in low concentrations,\" and links this to disposal in its ethical considerations. This demonstrates a more comprehensive understanding of a chemist's responsibilities. Because Essay A is equally strong in the core experimental design (RQ, background, method, variables) but superior in its holistic treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental impacts, it is the better essay.",
