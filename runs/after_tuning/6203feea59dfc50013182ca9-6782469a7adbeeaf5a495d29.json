  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement, specificity, and methodological rigor across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is exemplary in its detail and focus: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This specificity, including the exact concentration range and analytical method (UV-Vis), establishes a very clear and manageable investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand...\", is clear but lacks this level of precision.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay B is far more comprehensive and effectively justifies the investigation by identifying a clear research gap: \"There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts.\" This demonstrates genuine academic context. Essay A's background is relevant but more descriptive, lacking the same depth of research or clear justification for its novelty.\n\nThird, Essay B's methodology is superior due to its inclusion of a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which shows a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design by refining concentrations and measurement intervals. Essay A's procedure is logical, but Essay B's demonstrates a more mature scientific process. Furthermore, Essay B's control of variables is more robust; for instance, it details using \"an opaque cardboard box was used to cover the UV-lamp\" to control outside light, which is more specific than Essay A's plan to control temperature by \"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard\".\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B shows a much stronger handling of environmental considerations. Essay A makes a significant error by stating that waste was \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory,\" which is unsafe and environmentally irresponsible. Essay B takes a far more appropriate approach, stating that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC.\" While both essays neglect to explicitly address ethical considerations, Essay A's flawed disposal plan is a major weakness that decisively places it below Essay B.",
