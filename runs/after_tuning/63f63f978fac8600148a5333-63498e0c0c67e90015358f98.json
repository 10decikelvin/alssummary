  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the scientific validity of the methodology and the depth of the background research. Essay A is built on a sound scientific foundation, whereas Essay B contains a fundamental chemical error that invalidates its entire experimental design.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly focused and detailed research question: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This RQ is exemplary as it specifies the exact range of the independent variable and the precise method of quantification. The background information is equally strong, correctly explaining the chemical principles of biosorption, the role of functional groups, and critically, justifying the acidic pH range by referencing copper (II) hydroxide precipitation (\"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4\"). In contrast, Essay B's investigation is based on a flawed premise. Its procedure calls for making a \"stock solution of 0.6M CaSO4,\" which is chemically impossible as the solubility of calcium sulfate is approximately 0.015 M. This fundamental error undermines the entire investigation.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology demonstrates a much more thoughtful and rigorous exploration process. The inclusion of \"Preliminary Trials\" is a significant strength, showing how the student refined the procedure by testing pH ranges and contact times. The control of variables is comprehensive and well-justified. Essay B's methodology, while structured correctly, is unworkable due to the solubility error. Furthermore, its choice to measure absorbance at 210 nm is questionable due to potential interference in the far-UV range, unlike Essay A's more robust choice of 811 nm for a colored copper solution.\n\nFinally, Essay A thoroughly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations as required for an experimental investigation. It provides specific disposal instructions for heavy metals: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\". It also explicitly addresses ethics, stating \"No ethical concerns were raised\". Essay B adequately covers safety but critically omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, a significant failure in a lab-based report. Essay A\u2019s meticulous approach to experimental design, its scientifically accurate background, and its complete fulfillment of the criterion's formal requirements make it the far better essay.",
