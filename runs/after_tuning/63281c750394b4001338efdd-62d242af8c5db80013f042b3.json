  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key aspects of Criterion B.\n\n**1. Research Question and Background:** Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-formulated: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\" It is precise, specifying the exact independent variable values and the analytical technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail. Furthermore, Essay B's background provides a sophisticated chemical explanation of EDTA complexometric back-titration, which is directly relevant to its complex methodology. Essay A's background is relevant but covers more fundamental concepts.\n\n**2. Methodology and Variables:** Essay B outlines a more complex and rigorously planned methodology. The inclusion of a \"Comparison of Method\" section, justifying the choice of titration over FAAS and ISE-CT, demonstrates a high level of research and planning. The identification of variables in Essay B is far more thorough, with a detailed table listing nine controlled variables and how each is managed. Essay A's methodology is appropriate but simpler, and its list of three controlled variables is far less comprehensive. Essay A also conflates the measured dependent variable (temperature change) with the calculated one (specific heat capacity), a minor but notable imprecision.\n\n**3. Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Essay B excels in this area. It identifies specific chemical hazards, stating \"a higher concentration of ammonia solution will cause corrosive injuries such as permanent eye damage\" and mandates the use of a fume cupboard because \"ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive.\" Its environmental consideration regarding minimizing milk wastage is also specific and thoughtful. In contrast, Essay A's safety precautions are generic (\"Wear rubber gloves,\" \"Wearing safety goggles\"). Its environmental note, \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box,\" lacks specific detail. Both essays correctly state that no ethical considerations apply.\n\nIn summary, Essay B presents a more challenging, detailed, and well-researched investigation. Its specificity in the research question, depth in the background and methodology, and comprehensive attention to variables and safety make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
