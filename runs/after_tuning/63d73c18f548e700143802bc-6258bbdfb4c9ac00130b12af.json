  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections for an experimental investigation. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-formulated: \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity...\". It is clear, focused, and highly specific, detailing the exact ratios to be tested and the method of determination. Its background provides a solid theoretical foundation, explaining the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the concept of buffer capacity, and justifies the choice of a carbonate-bicarbonate system over a more complex biological one.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and meticulous approach to experimental design overall. While its research question is also strong, specifying the independent variable range (\"different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C)\") and dependent variables (\"Acid value and saponification value\"), it excels in its consideration of variables and safety. Essay B's table of controlled variables is more comprehensive, including factors like \"Moisture\", \"Microbial Contamination\", and \"Light\", which demonstrates a deeper understanding of potential confounding factors in oil chemistry. Furthermore, Essay B's Risk Assessment is significantly more detailed, identifying specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"Oil is flammable when heated at higher temperature\" and providing specific, relevant precautions. Essay B also includes a dedicated \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explicitly explains the rationale behind procedural choices, a hallmark of a well-considered exploration. While Essay A is good, Essay B's superior depth in controlling variables and assessing risks makes it the better example of Criterion B.",
