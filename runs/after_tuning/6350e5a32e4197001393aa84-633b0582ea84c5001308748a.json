  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more focused, coherent, and well-designed investigation from the outset. Its dual research questions are very clear and specific: \"1. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion? 2. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its boiling point?\". The essay clearly controls variables by stating it will investigate \"only linear primary alcohols.\" In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources...\", is less focused because it conflates two independent variables (NaCl concentration and water source), making the investigation's design complex and potentially flawed.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is perfectly aligned with its data-based approach, identifying credible databases (\"Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\" and \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook\") and even considering data processing steps. Essay A's experimental methodology is appropriate for its topic, but the overall investigation is muddled; the introduction states an additional goal to \"determine which of the two methods is the most accurate,\" which distracts from the primary research question. While Essay A has a very strong and detailed section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations (e.g., \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\"), which is appropriate for an experimental study, this strength does not compensate for the foundational weakness in its research design. The quality of the research question and methodological design are paramount in Criterion B, and in this regard, Essay B is significantly stronger. Essay B's background information also excels by strongly linking chemical principles (enthalpy, intermolecular forces) to a clear, real-world context of sustainable fuels.",
