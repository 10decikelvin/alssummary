  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B. While both essays present clear and focused research questions, Essay A's question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is slightly more detailed within the question itself. Essay A provides a highly detailed, logical, and replicable methodology that integrates modern technology like the Vernier LabQuest and Tracker software to enhance accuracy. Its discussion of variables is exemplary, with a comprehensive table for controlled variables detailing not only *what* is controlled but *how* and *why*, such as: \"Amount of Cornstarch...each sample will be made with 15.00g, which will be measured with a scale with an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.01g.\" Essay B's methodology, in contrast, is confusingly structured with sections out of logical order, making it difficult to follow. Furthermore, its \"Health and safety section\" is critically incomplete; for the hazard \"Acetic acid is very dangerous as it could harm one's eyes,\" the corresponding \"How hazard/risk will be minimized\" column is left blank. Crucially, Essay A includes a thorough \"Risk Assessment\" table that explicitly addresses safety (\"Handling of glass\"), environmental impact (\"Disposal of bioplastics\"), and even nuanced ethical considerations (\"Use of edible materials\"). Essay B completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental factors. Due to its superior methodological design, rigorous control of variables, and comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay A is the stronger piece of work.",
