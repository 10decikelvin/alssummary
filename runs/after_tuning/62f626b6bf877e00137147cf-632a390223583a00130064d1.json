  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a far deeper and more thorough approach to the exploration criteria. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is focused, specific, and lists the exact range of the independent variable, which is a hallmark of a strong investigation. This is supported by an extensive and relevant background section that defines key concepts like plastics, bioplastics, plasticizers, and Young's Modulus, providing a solid theoretical foundation. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is highly detailed, and its identification of variables is exemplary, presented in a clear table that not only lists controlled variables like \"Amount of Cornstarch\" but also explains the method of control and the potential impact on results. It also thoughtfully addresses safety, environmental (\"disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes\"), and ethical considerations (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is significantly weaker in its foundational elements. Its research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is vague, failing to specify the range or intervals for the \"expiration date.\" The introduction is minimal, stating only that \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry,\" with no specific background on complexometric titration, EDTA, or the chemistry of calcium in milk. Most critically, Essay A completely omits a dedicated section for controlled variables, which is a major flaw in experimental design. While it has a reasonable risk assessment (\"Ethanol should be kept away from heat as it is very flammable\"), it fails to address ethical considerations and provides only a generic environmental statement. Overall, Essay B's meticulous planning, clear focus, and comprehensive detail make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
