  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the depth of scientific engagement, methodological rigor, and completeness of the required sections.\n\nFirst, Essay B presents a more sophisticated and detailed research question: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This RQ is superior because it not only specifies the independent variable range (pH 1.0-5.0) but also explicitly states the method of quantification (UV-vis spectrophotometry), demonstrating foresight in the experimental design. In contrast, Essay A's RQ is clear but lacks this level of methodological specificity: \"What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion (kJmol\u207b\u00b9)?\".\n\nSecond, Essay B's background information and methodology show a higher level of understanding and personal engagement. The background thoroughly explains complex concepts like biosorption, chelation, and the chemical basis for pH's effect on the process, linking directly to Le Chatelier's Principle. The methodology is advanced, appropriately using a spectrophotometer, and crucially, it details preliminary trials that informed the final procedure, such as adjusting the pH range to avoid precipitation. Essay B states, \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated... Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation\". This refinement is a hallmark of excellent exploration. Essay A's calorimetry method is appropriate for its RQ but is a standard school experiment with less evidence of personal input or refinement.\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B successfully addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It provides a specific plan for chemical disposal: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area to prevent contamination of drainage water.\" It also explicitly addresses ethics: \"No ethical concerns were raised as no living organisms were harmed\". Essay A provides a good safety table but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal. This omission, combined with the superior depth and rigor of Essay B, makes the choice clear.",
