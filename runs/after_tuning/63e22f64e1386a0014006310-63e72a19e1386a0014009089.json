  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations with clear research questions and methodologies. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and detail across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations, the substance used, and the volume of the sample, including uncertainty. Essay A's research question is also clear but lacks this level of precision.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is more comprehensive, linking the investigation to the real-world context of global warming and ocean salinity. It also explains the underlying chemistry in greater depth, including the \"salting out\" effect and the full redox reactions of the Winkler titration method, shown with equations such as \"2Mn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 4OH\u207b(aq) + O\u2082(aq) \u2192 2MnO\u2082(s) + 2H\u2082O(l)\". Essay A's background is relevant but less detailed.\n\nBoth essays clearly outline variables and provide logical procedures. However, the most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this section. Essay A provides a good table of safety risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" and \"Handling a heated calorimeter\" but completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations. In contrast, Essay B provides a very detailed table covering hazards and first aid for all specific chemicals used and, crucially, includes specific environmental disposal instructions, stating that chemicals \"Must not be disposed together with household garbage. Do not allow product to reach sewage system.\" This comprehensive approach to all aspects of the criterion makes Essay B superior.",
