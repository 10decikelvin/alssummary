  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger as it exhibits a more rigorous and precise approach to experimental design, which is a cornerstone of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\" is exemplary. It is highly specific, including the exact levels of the independent variable, the substances being tested, the dependent variable, and the method of measurement, while also using evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources...as determined by two different methodologies...\" is clear but lacks this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's handling of variables is far superior. The independent variable (\"Temperature of citrus juice\") and dependent variable (\"Concentration of vitamin C\") are correctly identified. Its table of controlled variables is comprehensive, providing a method and justification for controlling each one. Essay A, however, demonstrates confusion in this critical area; it incorrectly identifies the \"Mass of sample before titrating\" as the independent variable, when the true independent variable is the *source* of the calcium carbonate (chalk, seashell, rangoli powder). This fundamental misunderstanding of variable identification significantly weakens its experimental design.\n\nWhile both essays provide relevant background information and appropriate methodologies, Essay B's comprehensive approach to safety, ethical, and environmental considerations also gives it an edge. Essay B explicitly addresses all three categories, including a thoughtful ethical consideration: \"the least possible amount of fruits was used and they were thoroughly squeezed to minimize the waste of such products\". Essay A provides good safety and environmental points, such as noting that excess chemicals \"may affect soil pH, thereby disrupting the ecosystem,\" but it completely omits any ethical considerations. Ultimately, Essay B's precision in the research question and its correct, detailed treatment of variables make it a much stronger example of scientific exploration.",
