  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong Criterion B components, but Essay B demonstrates a slightly more thorough and comprehensive approach to the exploration.\n\n**Research Question:** Both research questions are excellent. Essay A's RQ, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is focused and appropriately detailed, specifying the exact concentrations and the measurement technique. Similarly, Essay B's RQ, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is also specific, clear, and outlines the independent variable's range and the precise analytical method.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Both essays provide relevant, well-researched background information that directly supports their chosen methodology. Essay A's explanation of the Beer-Lambert law and its pre-test titration to determine the bleach concentration show excellent scientific forethought. However, Essay B's methodology section is slightly superior. It includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section where it justifies choosing complexometric titration over other methods like FAAS, demonstrating a deeper level of research and critical thinking about the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B includes a detailed \"Limitations\" table within its methodology, proactively identifying potential issues and proposing improvements, which is a hallmark of a well-considered plan.\n\n**Variables & Safety/Ethical/Environmental:** Both essays clearly define their variables and present good control measures. Essay B's table of controlled variables is exceptionally detailed, providing more in-depth justifications for each. Crucially, in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay B is more complete. Both essays are experimental and address safety well. Essay B explicitly addresses ethical considerations by stating, \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved in the experiment,\" which, while simple, is a required component that Essay A omits. Essay B also provides a thoughtful environmental consideration about minimizing food waste. Essay A has good safety and environmental sections but misses the ethical aspect entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is a very strong piece of work, Essay B's more comprehensive justification of its methodology, more detailed consideration of variables, and its explicit inclusion of all three required safety, ethical, and environmental aspects make it the better example of Criterion B.",
