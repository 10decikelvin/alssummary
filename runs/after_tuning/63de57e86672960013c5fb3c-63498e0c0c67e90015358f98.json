  "reasoning": "Essay A is stronger because it demonstrates a more comprehensive and thorough approach to all aspects of Criterion B for an experimental investigation. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact values for the independent variable and a key controlled parameter directly within the question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". Essay B's question is also clear but lacks this level of self-contained detail. While both essays provide relevant background information, Essay A's is more focused, directly linking concepts like Faraday's law to the hypothesis.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A provides a clear, step-by-step procedure that is easily replicable. In contrast, Essay B's procedure, while scientifically sound, has minor gaps in clarity (e.g., the stock concentration for the MgCl2 serial dilution is not explicitly stated). The most significant differentiator, however, is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. As an experimental investigation, Essay A excels by providing specific safety warnings (\"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive and viscous liquid\"), explicitly addressing ethical concerns (\"There are no ethical issues to be considered\"), and offering detailed environmental disposal instructions (\"Copper sulphate is a pesticide... can be harmful to the environment and aquatic life... can be mixed with saw dust which can be disposed of as solid waste\"). Essay B's safety section is minimal, and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for an experimental lab report.",
