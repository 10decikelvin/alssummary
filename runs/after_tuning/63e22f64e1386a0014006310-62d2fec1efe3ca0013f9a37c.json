  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior understanding and application of the scientific process required by Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Both research questions are focused and appropriate. Essay A's RQ is very specific, clearly stating the independent variables (\"length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)\" and \"classification (primary, secondary, tertiary)\") and the dependent variable (\"enthalpy change of combustion (kJmol\u207b\u00b9)\"). Essay B's RQ (\"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\") is also clear and focused. Essay A is slightly more ambitious with its two-part question.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Both essays provide relevant background information. Essay B's background is slightly more sophisticated as it directly introduces the Arrhenius equation (\"k=A e^(-Ea/RT)\"), which is central to its data analysis. Essay A's methodology is a standard calorimetry experiment, which is appropriate, but Essay B's kinetic study to determine activation energy is more complex and demonstrates a higher level of engagement. Both students show good awareness of their procedural limitations in the evaluation sections.\n\n**Variables:** Both essays correctly identify and control their variables effectively. They clearly list independent, dependent, and controlled variables with justification.\n\n**Safety, Environmental, & Ethical Considerations:** This is the key differentiating factor. Both are experimental investigations requiring full consideration of these aspects. Essay A provides a good table of safety risks and precautions but completely omits any mention of environmental impact or disposal. In contrast, Essay B not only provides specific safety precautions (\"iodopropanone is a lachrymator so it should be placed in the fume cupboard\") but also explicitly addresses environmental concerns with correct disposal instructions: \"The iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste and the propanone solution should be disposed of in the organic waste.\" This inclusion of specific environmental considerations makes Essay B's approach to this criterion far more complete and aligned with IB expectations.\n\nOverall, while both are strong, Essay B's more complete treatment of the required criteria, particularly its inclusion of specific environmental disposal methods, makes it the superior piece of work for Criterion B.",
