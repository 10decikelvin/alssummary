  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it exhibits greater scientific rigor in its research question, theoretical background, methodology, and safety considerations. Essay A's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", investigates a relationship between two continuous variables, which is more sophisticated than Essay B's simple comparison question. Furthermore, Essay A's background is exceptional, providing a detailed theoretical framework by deriving the second-order integrated rate law, \"1/c - 1/c\u2080 = kt,\" which directly justifies the chosen methodology. In contrast, Essay B's background is largely descriptive and lacks this level of chemical theory.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A employs a complex but scientifically sound procedure to determine the rate constant. Essay B's chosen methodology is fundamentally flawed for its stated purpose, a weakness the student correctly identifies later: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This flaw undermines the validity of the entire investigation. While both essays effectively identify variables, Essay A's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations is far more complete. Essay A provides specific safety measures for its chemicals (\"sodium hydroxide is corrosive, gloves were worn\") and addresses environmental disposal (\"ethyl acetate was flushed down the sink with large quantities of water\"). Conversely, Essay B offers poor safety advice (\"Gloves are not necessary\") and completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental concerns, which is a critical failure for an experimental investigation.",
