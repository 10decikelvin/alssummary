  "reasoning": "While both submissions demonstrate a good understanding of the scientific process, Essay A is superior due to its meticulous planning, detailed methodology, and clear articulation of variables. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is highly specific, outlining the exact concentrations to be tested and the measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", is less detailed. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is exceptionally thorough, even including a pre-test titration to determine the concentration of the stock solution\u2014a crucial step demonstrating advanced planning. The control of variables in Essay A is explicitly detailed in a table, explaining why each variable (temperature, volume, dye type) needs to be controlled. Essay B's methodology is less complete and lacks a specific list of controlled variables. Although Essay B has a strong evaluation section acknowledging its own flaws, such as significant heat loss, the overall design and presentation in Essay A are more robust and scientifically sound.",
