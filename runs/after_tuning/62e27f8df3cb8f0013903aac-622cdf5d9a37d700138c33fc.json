  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B based on the Criterion B marking scheme. The primary differentiators are the quality of the research question and the thoroughness of the safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations. Essay A's research question is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, stating: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". This single sentence contains the independent variable with its specific range, the dependent variable, key controlled variables (concentrations), and the precise method of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction...\", is much broader and lacks the same level of specificity within the question itself, with the details of the oils being explained later in the background.\n\nFurthermore, both essays describe experimental investigations, making detailed S/E/E considerations essential. Essay A excels here with a comprehensive table outlining specific risks and mitigation for each chemical. For example, for sulfuric acid, it notes it \"Causes severe skin burns or blisters and eye damage\" and advises to \"use ventilation, wear protective gloves, clothing and face shield.\" It also addresses environmental impact, stating \"Do not wash down the sink as it is harmful to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay B, however, provides a minimal risk assessment (\"Oven (High Temperatures): Heat-proof gloves were worn...\") and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw for a lab-based investigation.\n\nWhile both essays present a well-structured methodology with appropriate variables and relevant background information, Essay A's inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section further demonstrates a more rigorous and refined experimental design process. It justifies its final procedure with statements like, \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data in the colorimeter, so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" This level of detail, combined with its superior research question and comprehensive safety analysis, firmly establishes Essay A as the stronger piece of work.",
