  "reasoning": "Both submissions present clear and well-structured investigations. Essay B has a stronger personal engagement and provides a good theoretical background with relevant chemical equations and Faraday's Laws. Its methodology is clear and replicable. Essay A, however, demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design.\n\nWhile both essays have clear research questions and appropriate methodologies, Essay A's treatment of variables is more thorough. In its \"Controlled Variables\" table, it not only states *how* each variable is controlled but also justifies *why* it is important to control it, showing a deeper level of thinking. For example, for the \"Amount of Cornstarch,\" it explains, \"Having different amounts of cornstarch would mean that different samples have more or less to polymerize, therefore changing the relative plastic properties.\" Essay B simply states how variables are controlled without this explanatory depth. Furthermore, Essay A includes a section on \"Uncontrolled Variables,\" which demonstrates a more critical and reflective approach to the experimental limitations.\n\nMost importantly, Essay A correctly addresses all three required considerations: Safety, Environmental, and Ethical. It provides specific safety precautions (\"use heat resistant gloves\"), environmental disposal methods (\"disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes\"), and a thoughtful ethical consideration (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that... food and water are being wasted\"). Essay B covers safety and environmental aspects well but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a significant weakness under the IB criteria. Due to its more comprehensive handling of experimental design and inclusion of all required elements, Essay A is the stronger submission.",
