  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a far more thorough and well-developed exploration of its topic. The fundamental components of Criterion B are executed to a much higher standard in Essay A. Its research question is exemplary, stating, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question is focused, specific, and details both the exact conditions of the independent variable and the methods for measuring the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay B's question is less specific, lacking details on the range of the independent variable (expiration date).\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the background information. Essay A provides extensive, relevant, and focused theoretical context, discussing collision theory, Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, redox chemistry, and the general mechanism of oscillating reactions. Essay B, on the other hand, provides no scientific background whatsoever, jumping directly from the research question into an incomplete procedural list, which is a critical omission. Furthermore, Essay A clearly identifies and justifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a detailed table, whereas Essay B fails to explicitly list its variables at all. While both essays are experimental and address safety, Essay A's environmental considerations are more thoughtful, detailing not only proper disposal (\"solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\") but also proactive waste reduction (\"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three\"). Essay B's methodology is presented as an incomplete list, while Essay A's methodology is detailed and shows personal engagement by explaining the rationale behind equipment choices.",
