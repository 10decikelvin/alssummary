  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay B is better. The primary reason for this is the superior quality of its foundational components: the research question, variables, and methodology.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is exemplary in its clarity and specificity: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea (Tetley Black Tea, American Breakfast Black Tea, Filiz Black Tea, & Red Label Tea) using dichloromethane in a separating funnel\". It clearly identifies the independent variable (four named tea brands), the dependent variable with units (\"caffeine content (mg)\"), and the specific experimental technique. In contrast, Essay A's research question is fundamentally confused and contradictory: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes... by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\". It simultaneously proposes a secondary data comparison and a primary experimental method (Winkler's) without explaining how they are integrated, which represents a critical flaw in the investigation's design from the outset.\n\nSecond, Essay B demonstrates a much stronger understanding and presentation of variables. Its controlled variables are laid out in a clear table that not only identifies the variable (e.g., \"Volume of water (ml)\") but also explains *how* it will be controlled (\"Measure exactly 200 ml\") and *why* it is important (\"ensuring a fair comparison\"). Essay A correctly identifies its variables but presents them in a simple list of \"Constants\" without this deeper justification.\n\nThird, while both methodologies are detailed, Essay B's procedure directly and fully addresses its research question. Essay A's methodology, although chemically thorough for the Winkler titration, completely fails to address the \"pollution level\" or \"secondary data\" aspects mentioned in its own research question, creating a significant disconnect between the stated aim and the described procedure.\n\nFinally, regarding safety and environmental considerations, Essay A is stronger. It provides a more comprehensive list of chemical risks and includes a statement on environmental disposal: \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals\". Essay B's safety section is adequate but less comprehensive, and it completely omits any mention of environmental impact or disposal, a notable weakness given the use of a chlorinated solvent. However, the fundamental flaws in Essay A's research question and its mismatch with the methodology are more critical failures under Criterion B than Essay B's omission of an environmental statement. The coherence and focus of the entire investigation, which are paramount, are far superior in Essay B.",
