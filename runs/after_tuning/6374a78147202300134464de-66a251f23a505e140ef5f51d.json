  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor, depth, and engagement across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is significantly more precise and focused. It explicitly states the independent variable range and reactant concentrations: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change...\", lacks this critical specificity regarding the range of concentrations being tested.\n\nSecond, the background information and methodology in Essay B are far more sophisticated. Essay B's background links the investigation to Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Beer-Lambert's law, creating a strong theoretical foundation. Its methodology reflects this complexity with a two-part procedure that includes creating a calibration curve and explicitly mentions the value of preliminary work: \"Preliminary experiments were conducted... the reaction was found to reach equilibrium after around 10 minutes at room temperature.\" Essay A's background is relevant but less detailed, and its methodology is a straightforward, single-step procedure without the same level of planning and justification.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is exemplary. Its controlled variables table not only identifies the variables but also explains *why* they must be controlled, for example: \"Changes in the volume and concentration of this reactant would\u2019ve changed the position of equilibrium...\". Essay A correctly identifies its variables but provides no such justification for their control.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay B is more thorough and specific. It details the risks associated with each chemical, stating \"Potassium thiocyanate is harmful by inhalation... Contact with acids liberates toxic gas.\" Essay A's safety section is more generic and suggests questionable disposal (\"disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\"), which contradicts its environmental considerations. Overall, Essay B presents a well-planned, deeply understood, and methodologically sound investigation that is far superior to Essay A's more superficial exploration.",
