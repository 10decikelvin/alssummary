  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and depth across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally strong: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This question is highly focused, specifying the species, conditions, analytical method, and a precise concentration range. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity.\n\nEssay A's background is directly relevant and scientifically sophisticated, explaining the Photo-Fenton reaction and the \"scavenging effect,\" which directly justifies its choice of H\u2082O\u2082 concentrations. Conversely, Essay B's background contains a significant conceptual error, confusing reaction rate with enthalpy change by stating that higher concentration \"causes faster production of heat.\" This misunderstands that enthalpy change (\u0394H) is a state function, not a rate.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is superior. It outlines a well-controlled experiment with five variations of the independent variable, which is appropriate for determining reaction order. The inclusion of \"Preliminary Trials\" shows personal engagement and refinement of the method. Essay B's methodology uses only two concentrations (0.5M and 1.0M), which is insufficient to establish a meaningful relationship. Finally, Essay A demonstrates stronger safety and environmental awareness, noting the specific hazards of its chemicals (\"carcinogens\") and a responsible disposal plan (\"in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\"), whereas Essay B suggests a questionable environmental practice of disposing of copper (II) sulphate \"down the drain\".",
