  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work for Criterion B. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly more refined and focused approach to experimental design.\n\nEssay A's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" It precisely defines the concentrations, independent variable range, and method of measurement. Essay B's question is also strong, but slightly less specific in its wording. The background information in both essays is relevant and detailed, with Essay A clearly linking collision theory and the Arrhenius equation to its methodology, while Essay B provides a comprehensive literature review on milk chemistry.\n\nThe key differentiator is in the methodology and experimental development. Essay A includes a dedicated \"Preliminary Testing\" section, where it justifies its chosen temperature range by explaining that \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data\" and its use of a hotplate over a water bath. This demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative, and authentic scientific process. Essay B has a solid methodology and appropriately identifies variables, including uncontrolled ones, but lacks this evidence of procedural refinement. Both essays have strong safety and environmental considerations appropriate for their experimental nature. Essay B is superior in this specific sub-point as it explicitly addresses ethical considerations (\"No ethical concerns were identified\"), whereas Essay A omits this.\n\nDespite Essay B's slightly better handling of S/E/E, Essay A's superior research question and, crucially, its demonstrated use of preliminary trials to inform and justify its final methodology, showcases a deeper level of engagement with the practical aspects of the investigation, giving it a marginal edge.",
