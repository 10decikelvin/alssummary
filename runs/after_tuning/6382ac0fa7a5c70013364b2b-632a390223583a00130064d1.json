  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is significantly stronger as it clearly defines a focused relationship between a specific independent variable with a stated range and a measurable dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...\", is a comparative measurement rather than an investigation into a relationship, and it lacks specificity. Furthermore, Essay B's background information is much more detailed and scientifically relevant, defining concepts like polymers, plasticizers, and Young's Modulus with supporting equations, whereas Essay A's background is more anecdotal.\n\nCritically, Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design. It correctly identifies the independent, dependent, and a comprehensive list of controlled variables, even thoughtfully including a section on uncontrolled variables. Essay A, however, fundamentally misidentifies its independent variable, stating it is the \"Mass of sample before titrating\" when it is actually the source of the sample (chalk, seashells, etc.) and the methodology used. This represents a significant conceptual error. While both essays describe appropriate methodologies, Essay B's method is more sophisticated, involving the synthesis of a material and the use of technology like \"Vernier LabQuest 2\" and \"Tracker Software\" for precise measurement. Finally, Essay B provides a complete risk assessment, explicitly addressing safety, environmental (\"disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes\"), and ethical considerations (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\"). Essay A addresses safety and environmental concerns well but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations.",
