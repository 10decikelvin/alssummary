  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally well-defined and focused: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". This level of specificity, including concentrations, temperatures, and measurement techniques, provides a clear and achievable scope. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", while clear, lacks this precision.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A presents a sophisticated and appropriate procedure using a colorimeter to gather precise data for calculating reaction rates, which directly aligns with its advanced kinetics-based background section. Essay B's methodology is fundamentally flawed; it proposes using a constant mass (5 grams) of different salts, which ignores the molar relationships and the role of the van't Hoff factor that its own background section identifies as crucial. This inconsistency undermines the entire investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's procedure for separating and measuring melted water is vague and prone to significant error.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its consideration of safety and environmental factors. It includes a detailed table (\"Table 4: Safety concerns for the chemicals used...\") that outlines specific risks for each chemical (e.g., \"Pure Propanone...Highly flammable\") and appropriate mitigation and disposal instructions. Essay B, despite being an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a critical failure in this criterion. Essay A's thoroughness in its research question, methodology, and safety protocols makes it a much stronger submission.",
