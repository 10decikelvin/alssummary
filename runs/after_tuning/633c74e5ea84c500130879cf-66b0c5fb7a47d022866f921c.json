  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much stronger command of all elements of Criterion B. Its superiority begins with the research question and background. Essay B presents a focused and specific research question: \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\". This is supported by a detailed background that establishes a clear real-world context related to fuel efficiency and environmentalism. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad, lacks specificity regarding the salts and temperature ranges, and attempts to tackle two independent variables, which weakens the focus of the investigation.\n\nThe quality gap widens significantly in the discussion of methodology and variables. Essay B provides an exemplary variables section, correctly identifying the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. The controlled variables are presented in a comprehensive table with clear justifications for why and how they are controlled, such as for room temperature: \"The air conditioner will be set to 25\u00b0C...and all windows and doors will be shut\". Essay A\u2019s variable section is confused; it incorrectly identifies \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and provides a minimal list of controlled variables. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is highly detailed and replicable, including a precise serial dilution table, whereas Essay A's procedure contains vague steps like \"Five samples of each salt were taken according to the calculation of the solubility,\" which is circular and unclear.\n\nFinally, Essay B thoroughly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is crucial for an experimental investigation. It provides specific safety instructions (\"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\") and appropriate environmental disposal methods (\"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\"). It also correctly states that \"No ethical considerations were considered\". Essay A, on the other hand, offers only a generic safety precaution and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical failure for this criterion. Overall, Essay B exhibits a level of detail, clarity, and scientific rigor that is absent in Essay A.",
