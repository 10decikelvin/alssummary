  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's question, 'How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?', is more specific and focused than Essay A's, 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?', which lacks specific parameters. Essay B provides a more detailed background, including the relevant electrochemical principles with the Nernst equation, while Essay A's background is less substantial. Both essays clearly identify independent and dependent variables. However, Essay B's methodology is more robust and detailed, providing specific concentrations and volumes, whereas Essay A lacks such detail. Both essays address safety and environmental concerns, but Essay A's discussion of waste disposal ('dispose of properly') is vaguer than Essay B's ('disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain and threw the zinc granules in the trash can after cleaning it with water'). Finally, while both essays acknowledge experimental limitations, Essay B's analysis is more thorough, discussing specific errors like heat loss and impurities. Therefore, despite both being solid efforts, Essay B is superior due to its more detailed methodology, deeper theoretical grounding, and more specific procedural and safety considerations.",
