  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's is more detailed. Essay B's research question, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\", is superior to Essay A's \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\" because it specifies the exact temperatures being investigated and the concentrations of the reactants. Essay B also offers a much more thorough background section, including a relevant diagram and a chemical equation. While Essay A's methods are understandable, Essay B's are laid out in a clearer, step-by-step format with specific quantities, making them more replicable. Furthermore, Essay B's safety considerations are more specific, mentioning the risk of cyanide gas production and the need for controlled heating. Both essays address environmental concerns appropriately, with Essay A mentioning the non-biodegradable nature of paraffin and Essay B the risks of its chemicals to aquatic life. However, the superior detail in the research question, methodology, and scientific background makes Essay B the stronger submission overall.",
