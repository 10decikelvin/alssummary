  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong investigations. Essay A has a very clear and specific research question: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\". It provides detailed background, a well-structured methodology with excellent control of variables, and a thorough section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B also has a strong research question: \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\". Its background section is notably impressive, showing a deep understanding of reaction kinetics by deriving the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction. The methodology, involving timed sampling and quenching, is more complex and demonstrates a higher level of experimental design than Essay A's. Although Essay A\u2019s safety and environmental section is slightly more detailed, mentioning specific disposal methods for all key chemicals, Essay B's overall scientific rigor, particularly the integration of advanced kinetic theory into its experimental design and analysis plan, makes it the superior submission. The ambition and complexity of the investigation in Essay B slightly outweigh the minor omissions in its procedural details.",
