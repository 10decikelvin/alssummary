  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of quality and detail in its exploration, making it superior.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core of the exploration, the research question, Essay B is exemplary. It asks: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\" This question is a model of clarity and specificity, embedding the exact independent variable values, the dependent variable's units, and key controlled parameters directly into the question itself. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is clear but lacks this high level of detail, requiring the reader to consult other sections to find the specific masses and volumes used.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology reflects a more rigorous and iterative scientific process. The author explicitly details conducting preliminary tests to refine the experimental design, stating, \"When pre-testing, I noticed that the rate of reaction...was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution, due to this I decided to use lower concentrations of HCl in order to achieve a clearer trend.\" This demonstrates a thoughtful approach to exploration that is not as evident in Essay A. While Essay A has strong control of variables, particularly its attempt to standardize surface area by stating \"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle...using 200 turns at medium pressure,\" Essay B's overall design process is more developed.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide strong background information and thorough safety, ethical, and environmental considerations appropriate for their experimental nature, Essay B's background connects the chemistry to a real-world application (pharmacology) and explains the reaction mechanism in slightly greater depth. Both essays correctly identify that they are experimental and address all required considerations; for instance, Essay A discusses specific disposal: \"Manganese dioxide catalyst remaining between trials as well as foam produced were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities.\" Similarly, Essay B notes specific disposal for its chemicals: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water.\" However, the superior research question and the documented refinement of methodology through pre-testing firmly place Essay B at a higher level for Criterion B.",
