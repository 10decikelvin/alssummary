  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality and understanding across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (kJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This question specifies the exact variables, units, substances, and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity, failing to define the concentration range or the method for determining enthalpy change.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is thorough, relevant, and directly supports the investigation by explaining d-orbital splitting, ligand exchange theory, and the principles of spectrophotometry. Essay B's background is less focused; while it correctly calculates the reaction's spontaneity, its explanation of the link between concentration and enthalpy relies on collision theory, which primarily explains reaction rates, not the overall energy change of a completed reaction, indicating a potential conceptual misunderstanding. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is clear, detailed, and includes five trials per variation, while Essay B's procedure is vague and contradictory, stating \"repeat steps 1-6 for 1.0M copper (II) sulphate solution,\" which implies a single trial, but later claiming in its strengths, \"I carried out two trials.\"\n\nFinally, Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are specific and appropriate, correctly identifying hazards and proper disposal methods like \"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\". Essay B contains a critical and dangerous contradiction. Under \"Safety issues,\" it states, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain,\" which is an unsafe and environmentally damaging practice. This directly contradicts its \"Environmental issues\" section, which claims, \"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways as they are hazardous and toxic\". This fundamental flaw demonstrates a severe lack of understanding of lab safety and environmental responsibility, solidifying Essay A's clear superiority.",
