  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental designs, but Essay A demonstrates a higher level of rigor and detail across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is exceptionally focused, stating \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC)...\". This level of specificity, including concentrations, temperatures, and measurement technique directly in the question, surpasses Essay B's solid but broader question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\".\n\nMethodologically, Essay A stands out by including a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which demonstrates a more developed investigative process by explaining how the procedure was refined based on initial trials. For example, it justifies the upper temperature limit: \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data in the colorimeter, so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" Essay B presents a suitable methodology, but lacks this evidence of refinement.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's treatment of safety and environmental considerations is more comprehensive. For each chemical, it details specific risks and mitigation strategies, as well as clear disposal instructions, such as for Sulfuric acid: \"Dispose according to local legislation. Neutralise with lime or soda ash.\" In contrast, Essay B's environmental assessment is a brief dismissal, \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is insufficient for an experimental investigation involving chemical waste. While Essay B does correctly address ethical concerns (\"No significant ethical concerns\"), which Essay A omits, the depth and specificity of Essay A's risk assessment is far superior. Overall, Essay A's meticulous detail in its question, methodology, and risk assessment makes it the stronger submission.",
