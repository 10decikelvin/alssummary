  "reasoning": "Both essays describe well-structured experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of sophistication and detail in its exploration, making it the stronger submission.\n\nEssay B's research question is superior due to its evaluative and specific nature: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\" This is more advanced than Essay A's descriptive question: \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate?\" Essay B's question frames the investigation as an evaluation of a specific scientific method, which shows a deeper engagement with the scientific process.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background is more compelling and directly justifies the research question. It effectively links the investigation to a significant real-world issue, stating, \"The idea for this investigation came about due to recent mass media coverage relating to global warming, causing increased temperatures in our global water systems.\" It then thoughtfully reviews multiple methods for measuring dissolved oxygen before explaining why the Winkler method was chosen for evaluation. Essay A's background is scientifically correct but more standard, focusing on theoretical concepts like collision theory and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nWhile both essays feature appropriate methodologies and correctly identified variables, Essay B excels in its safety considerations. It provides specific, actionable advice such as \"wear goggles, lab coat and gloves\" and notes the experiment will be \"conducted in a fume cupboard.\" In contrast, Essay A's safety measures are generic, stating, \"Very careful operations during the experiment and following the safety rules of the laboratory at all times,\" which lacks specificity. Both essays properly address environmental disposal, with Essay A noting a product was \"disposed of as a hazardous waste\" and Essay B giving instructions to \"not release... without first diluting with tap water,\" but the difference in safety detail is significant.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a competent and well-executed kinetics experiment. However, Essay B's superior research question, richer background context, and more detailed safety protocols demonstrate a higher quality of exploration and critical thinking.",
