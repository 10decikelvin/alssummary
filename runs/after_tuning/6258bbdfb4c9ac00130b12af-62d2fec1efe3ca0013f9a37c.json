  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly more thorough and comprehensive approach to the experimental design, making it the stronger of the two.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally clear and detailed: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration.\" This is superior to Essay B's question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", as it specifies the exact range of the independent variable and the methods of measurement.\n\nBoth essays provide relevant and focused background information. Essay A clearly explains the chemical principles behind Acid Value and Saponification Value, while Essay B effectively links reaction rates, catalysts, and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nIn terms of methodology, both are strong, but Essay A's is more robust. It includes a specific \"Justification for methodology\" section which explains choices like temperature range and reagent concentrations. Furthermore, its table of controlled variables is excellent, not only identifying the variables but also explaining *how* and *why* they need to be controlled (e.g., \"Light | Oil samples were stored in darkness... | Light triggers decomposition of oil...\"). Essay B's variables table is good but lacks this depth of justification.\n\nFinally, while both essays have strong safety and environmental considerations, Essay A is more complete by explicitly addressing ethical considerations: \"Ethical issues: There were no ethical issues in this investigation...\". Essay B completely omits any mention of ethics. This inclusion, combined with the more detailed justification for its methodology, gives Essay A a slight but clear edge.",
