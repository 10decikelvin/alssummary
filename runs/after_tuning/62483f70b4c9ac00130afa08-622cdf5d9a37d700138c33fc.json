  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it fully and competently addresses all required components of Criterion B, whereas Essay B has a critical omission. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is excellently formulated with evaluative language. Its background provides relevant chemical theory (Le Chatelier's Principle) and logically justifies the investigation by comparing different measurement techniques. In contrast, Essay B's research is framed as an aim rather than a question. While Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated and complex methodology and provides an outstanding table of controlled variables, it completely fails to address ethical and environmental considerations. Essay A, however, provides a model section on these aspects, stating \"Ethical Issues - There are no major ethical issues\" and providing specific disposal instructions: \"Environmental issues - Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting\". This complete adherence to the criteria, particularly the inclusion of specific safety, ethical, and environmental details for an experimental investigation, makes Essay A a more thorough and well-executed example of Criterion B.",
