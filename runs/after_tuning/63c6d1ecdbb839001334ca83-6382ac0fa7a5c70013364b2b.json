  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more scientifically rigorous and well-designed investigation. The research question is highly focused and specific, clearly stating the independent variable ('varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0)'), dependent variable ('mass of iron(II) extracted'), and the exact analytical method ('titration with acidified potassium permanganate'). In contrast, Essay B's research question is broader, comparing two methods across three samples, which is ambitious but less focused. Essay A's methodology is superior in its precision, correctly identifying the use of volumetric flasks and pipettes for accurate measurements, whereas Essay B's methodology mentions using a measuring cylinder for titration volumes, which is a significant procedural flaw. Furthermore, Essay A's control of variables is meticulous, with clear justifications for each controlled factor, such as noting 'If more HCl is added in one experiment, more iron may be dissolved.' Essay B's controls are more general, for example, stating for temperature control that 'the same Bunsen Burner was used,' which is not a reliable method for ensuring consistent temperature. Finally, Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental section is more detailed and professional, citing sources like CLEAPSS and considering the proper disposal of specific chemicals, making it a stronger overall example of a well-planned scientific exploration.",
