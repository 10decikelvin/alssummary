  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better as it exhibits a higher level of sophistication in its research question, provides a more comprehensive background, and addresses all procedural considerations more thoroughly than Essay A.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is evaluative and more complex than Essay A's investigative question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand...?\". The evaluative nature of Essay B's question requires a comparison against known values, demonstrating a deeper level of inquiry.\n\nSecond, Essay B's background is far more extensive and contextualized. It links the investigation to a significant real-world issue, stating that \"global water systems have also experienced declines in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations\" due to global warming. It then thoroughly compares multiple methods for measuring DO (colorimetric, sensors, Winkler) and explains the underlying chemistry with Le Chatelier's principle, providing a stronger justification for the chosen methodology. Essay A's background is relevant but limited to defining the core terms of its research question.\n\nThird, Essay B's methodology shows greater refinement. The inclusion of insights from \"preliminary trials,\" such as the need to \"use glass 1cm\u00b3 and 0.5cm\u00b3 pipettes... to reduce random error,\" demonstrates a more rigorous approach. Furthermore, Essay B's method for controlling its independent variable (temperature) using a \"water bath\" and \"ice\" is more precise than Essay A's control for temperature, which is simply \"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard\".\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B correctly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects required for an experimental investigation. It explicitly addresses ethics, stating, \"There are no major ethical issues surrounding the investigation,\" and provides a specific environmental disposal instruction: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\". In contrast, Essay A completely omits any mention of ethical considerations and its environmental note (\"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\") is generic and insufficient. While Essay A is a competent investigation, Essay B is superior in its depth, rigor, and fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements.",
