  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental plans. Essay B, however, is superior due to its more focused and well-defined research question and its deeper engagement with the scientific context. Essay B's question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is exemplary in its specificity, stating the exact independent variable range and the precise method of measuring the dependent variable. Essay A's question is good but less detailed. Furthermore, Essay B provides a more thorough background, connecting the chemistry to a real-world application (anemia medication) and justifying the choice of reagent concentrations. While Essay A's methodology is sound, Essay B's use of titration is a more precise analytical technique than measuring foam volume. Essay B also shows strong reflective practice by explicitly stating, \"In my trials, I noticed that when experimenting with HCl of pH range 2.0 to 4.0... Therefore, I changed the range used to pH 2.0 to 6.0.\" This demonstrates a more sophisticated approach to experimental design. Although Essay A presents its controlled variables more neatly in a table, Essay B still mentions how they are controlled within the text. Both essays have strong safety sections, but Essay B's environmental considerations are more specific, noting that KMnO4 is \"Toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects.\"",
