  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of precision, planning, and detail across all aspects of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the research question. Essay B's question, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3...1.000mol dm^-3)...in 2 minutes?\", is exemplary in its specificity. It quantifies the independent variable with exact concentrations, defines the dependent variable with units, and specifies the substance, mass, and time frame. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level...\", relies on a poorly defined independent variable (\"pollution level\") which is determined qualitatively rather than quantitatively, making the investigation less focused.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology and handling of variables are more rigorous. The inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section shows a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design. Its controlled variables are presented in a comprehensive table that not only lists them but also explains \"Why is it controlled?\" and \"How is it controlled?\", demonstrating a deep understanding of experimental design. Essay A identifies its variables correctly but lacks this level of detailed justification.\n\nFinally, Essay B is far more thorough in its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. While both essays have strong safety sections, Essay B explicitly addresses ethical considerations, stating, \"This experiment has no ethical considerations, other than keeping in mind the minimisation of waste.\" It also provides specific environmental details, explaining how waste was minimized and how excess acid was disposed of: \"disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water.\" Essay A's environmental note is generic (\"Laboratory standards were followed...\") and it omits any mention of ethics. Overall, Essay B presents a meticulously planned, justified, and considered exploration that is superior to Essay A's competent but less detailed approach.",
