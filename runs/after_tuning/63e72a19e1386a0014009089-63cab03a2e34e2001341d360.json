  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in meeting the requirements for Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally well-formulated research question: \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\" This question is focused, specific, and measurable, clearly defining the independent variable with its range and uncertainty, and the dependent variable with its units. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\", is confusing and contradictory. It claims to be a secondary data analysis while the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment, and it uses the vague, unquantified term \"pollution level\" as its independent variable.\n\nEssay A's background section provides a thorough chemical explanation for the phenomenon being investigated, discussing concepts like the \"salting out effect,\" dipole-induced-dipole interactions, and hydration, all of which are directly relevant to the research question. Essay B's background is more descriptive of the general problem of water pollution but lacks this depth of specific chemical theory.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is clear, logically structured, and provides specific quantities and concentrations, making it easily replicable. Its handling of variables is excellent, presenting them in a table that not only identifies them but also explains how they will be controlled and why that control is necessary. Essay B's variables section simply lists \"4 different Water bodies\" as the independent variable and provides a list of constants without justification. While Essay B has a slightly more detailed risk assessment for individual chemicals, both essays provide only a generic statement on environmental impact. However, the fundamental strength of Essay A's experimental design, rooted in its precise research question and supported by a strong theoretical background, makes it a much higher quality piece of work for this criterion.",
