  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and thorough approach to Criterion B.\n\nThe research questions in both essays are excellent. Essay A asks, \"How does an increase in ionic radii...of central metal ions...affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (kJ/mol)...calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\" This is highly specific, identifying the precise independent and dependent variables, their units, and the method of measurement. Similarly, Essay B's question is also very strong and focused: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3...)...reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", which clearly states the exact concentrations to be tested.\n\nBoth essays provide relevant, focused background information and appropriate methodologies. Essay A's background clearly connects d-orbital splitting theory to the experimental plan. Essay B's methodology is commendable for including a preliminary titration to determine the concentration of the commercial bleach, which shows excellent planning. Both essays also correctly identify their independent, dependent, and controlled variables with clear justifications.\n\nThe primary differentiator lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring these aspects to be addressed. Essay A is exemplary in this regard, with distinct sections for each. It specifies safety measures (\"safety goggles and lab coats will be worn at all times\"), ethical disposal (\"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\"), and environmental impact (\"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life\"). In contrast, while Essay B has a good safety table and a solid environmental paragraph detailing disposal (\"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container\"), it completely omits an explicit section on ethical considerations. This omission, while seemingly small, makes the section incomplete according to the criteria.\n\nBecause Essay A fully and explicitly addresses all required components of Criterion B, including the often-overlooked ethical considerations, it is the superior submission.",
