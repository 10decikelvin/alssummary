  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and well-structured investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of proficiency across most aspects of Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is superior. It is focused, clearly identifies the independent (pH of HCl) and dependent (mass of iron(II) extracted) variables, and specifies the range of the independent variable being investigated. Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources...as determined by two different methodologies...?\" is also good, but it's more of a comparison of methods and sources rather than a focused investigation into a single scientific relationship.\n\n**Background Information:** Essay B provides more detailed and relevant background information. It connects the experiment to a real-world context (anemia), explains the underlying chemistry of iron solubility and the redox titration, and even includes a calculation to justify the choice of titrant concentration (\"Moles of KMnO\u2084 required... = 4.08 x 10\u207b\u2074\"). Essay A's background is adequate, explaining the sources of CaCO\u2083 and giving the relevant equations, but it lacks the depth of chemical justification seen in B.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Both essays outline clear, repeatable procedures. Essay B, however, shows stronger experimental design. The identification and control of variables are more precise. For example, Essay B correctly identifies \"The pH of hydrochloric acid\" as the independent variable and provides a clear rationale for the chosen range. Essay A incorrectly lists \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable for both methods, when in fact the mass is a controlled variable and the *source* of the sample (chalk, seashell, rangoli) is the independent variable. Essay B also includes a list of apparatus with their uncertainties, which shows a higher level of engagement with the precision of the method.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays address safety well. Essay B, however, is more thorough by including specific notes on all three aspects (Safety, Ethical, Environmental). It mentions waste minimization as an ethical consideration (\"only the required amount of chemicals were provided... limiting the amount wasted\") and provides specific disposal instructions for chemicals based on their hazards (\"Acidified KMnO4 should not be poured down the drain... as it is labelled 'Toxic to aquatic life'\"). Essay A mentions safety and environmental aspects but omits any ethical considerations.\n\nOverall, Essay B is stronger due to its more focused research question, more thorough and justified background information, more accurate identification of variables, and more comprehensive consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental impacts.",
