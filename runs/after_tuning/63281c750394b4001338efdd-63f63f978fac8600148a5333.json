  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, the research question in Essay B is far more detailed and focused. Essay B asks, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\" This question is exemplary because it specifies the independent variable and its precise range (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), the dependent variable, the system being studied (orange peels), and the specific analytical method (UV-vis spectrophotometry). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity and detail.\n\nSecond, Essay B provides a significantly more in-depth and scientifically sophisticated background. It establishes a strong real-world context (heavy metal pollution), and scientifically justifies its chosen pH range by citing the precipitation point of Cu(OH)\u2082: \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4... the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" It then delves into the specific chemical mechanisms of biosorption, such as chelation and ion exchange, supported by chemical principles like Le Chatelier's Principle. Essay A's background is relevant but much more foundational, defining specific heat and providing a basic hypothesis without the same level of chemical depth.\n\nThird, Essay B's methodology and control of variables are more rigorous. The inclusion of \"Preliminary Trials\" shows a thoughtful, iterative approach to refining the experimental design. Furthermore, the list of controlled variables in Essay B is more comprehensive and better justified, including factors like \"Brand of Oranges\" and \"Shaking speed (400 rpm)\". Essay A's methodology is appropriate, but its identified controlled variables are more standard and less thoroughly explained.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations as required for experimental investigations, Essay B is more specific. Its environmental plan notes, \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area to prevent contamination of drainage water,\" which is directly relevant to the chemicals used. Essay A's statement, \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box,\" is correct but generic. Overall, Essay A represents a competent but standard investigation, whereas Essay B showcases a higher level of scientific engagement, depth, and rigour.",
