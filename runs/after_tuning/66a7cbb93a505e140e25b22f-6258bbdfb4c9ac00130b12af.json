  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of detail, complexity, and scientific awareness across all elements of Criterion B. While Essay A presents a competent and well-structured investigation, Essay B's submission is more rigorous and thorough.\n\nFirst, comparing the research questions, Essay B's is more detailed and specific. Essay A asks, \"How do different active ingredients... in different brands of indigestion tablets... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise...?\". This is a solid, focused question. However, Essay B's question is more precise by quantifying the independent variable: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\". The inclusion of the specific temperature range makes it a stronger research question.\n\nSecond, Essay B's treatment of variables is significantly more comprehensive. Essay A correctly identifies its main controlled variables, such as \"Concentration of HCl\". In contrast, Essay B presents a detailed table for six controlled variables, providing not only the variable but also clear \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\" justifications for each. This includes nuanced factors like \"Microbial Contamination\" and \"Light\", demonstrating a deeper understanding of potential confounding variables.\n\nFurthermore, the methodology and safety considerations in Essay B are of a higher caliber. Essay B outlines a complex multi-step procedure involving chemical standardization, reflux, and two different titration methods, supported by a detailed \"Justification for methodology\". Essay A's single titration method, while appropriate, is much simpler. For safety, Essay A provides adequate precautions like wearing goggles for \"handling strong acids like HCl.\" Essay B, however, provides a much more detailed risk assessment table, identifying multiple specific hazards such as \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"chances of bursting of flask if it is refluxed\" with corresponding, specific precautionary measures. This superior depth in planning, variable control, and risk assessment clearly makes Essay B the better submission.",
