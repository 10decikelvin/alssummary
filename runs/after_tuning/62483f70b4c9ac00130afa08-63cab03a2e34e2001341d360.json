  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because its investigation is built on a stronger scientific foundation, starting with a more focused and sophisticated research question. Essay A asks, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\" This question is clear, has an evaluative component (\"to what extent\"), and establishes a well-controlled experiment with a quantifiable independent variable (temperature). In contrast, Essay B's question is convoluted and contains a contradiction: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with... comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\" The mention of \"secondary data\" is confusing as the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment. Furthermore, its independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is qualitative and poorly controlled, relying on anecdotal observations rather than quantitative measures.\n\nEssay A's background research provides a robust chemical context, explaining the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen using Le Chatelier's Principle, which directly justifies the research question. Essay B's background is more descriptive and less analytical, justifying its variable (pollution) through observation rather than established scientific principles. While Essay B's methodology demonstrates impressive practical detail, including the standardization of a solution, this strength cannot overcome the fundamental weakness in its experimental design and variable control.\n\nFinally, Essay A more thoroughly addresses all procedural considerations. For environmental issues, it provides a specific disposal instruction: \"diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2.\" Essay B is more generic, stating, \"Laboratory standards were followed.\" Crucially, Essay A explicitly addresses ethical considerations (\"There are no major ethical issues\"), whereas Essay B completely omits this required element. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and scientifically rigorous approach to exploration.",
