  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it aligns more closely with the expectations of a high-quality scientific investigation for Criterion B. The most significant differentiator is the quality of the research question. Essay B's question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is analytical and focused on establishing a relationship between two continuous variables. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", is descriptive and compares discrete categories, which limits the scope of analysis. Furthermore, Essay B's background information provides a more detailed and relevant chemical foundation, including the balanced redox reaction for the titration: \"C~6~H~8~O~6~(l)+I~2~(l) \u2192 C~6~H~6~O~6~(l)+2 I\u207b+2 H\u207a\". While Essay A's background is relevant, it is more general. Most critically, Essay B includes a complete \"Risk Assessment\" section that explicitly addresses safety, ethical (\"No significant ethical concerns\"), and environmental (\"No significant environmental concerns\") considerations. Essay A addresses safety (\"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane\") but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental factors, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation involving a hazardous chlorinated solvent.",
