  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay B is better. Both essays present viable experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and scientific rigor across all assessed elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research question and background, Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\" is more focused and elegantly phrased than Essay A's, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\". Essay B's background is also superior as it provides a clear, referenced molecular-level justification for its hypothesis: \"The ions of potassium nitrate are held in a rigid matrix of water molecules... Adding heat to the solution does not increase the energy of these motions but rather increases the energy of the other water molecules.\" While Essay A's background correctly uses Gibbs free energy to establish the reaction's feasibility, which is a strength, Essay B's background is more directly linked to explaining the expected outcome of its specific investigation.\n\nSecond, in terms of methodology and variables, Essay B presents a more robust experimental design. It clearly outlines the calculation for its derived variable using `c = Q / (m\u0394T)` and explains how the heat supplied (Q) will be determined from electrical measurements (`Q = VIt`). This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the physics behind calorimetry. Furthermore, Essay B explicitly states, \"The same procedure will be done in three trials,\" indicating a plan for ensuring reliability, which Essay A does not mention. Both essays correctly identify their respective variables.\n\nFinally, the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is a critical differentiator. Both essays explicitly address all three categories. However, Essay B's safety precautions are more specific to its procedure, noting risks from electricity (\"Wear rubber gloves to act as an insulator in case a naked wire is touched\") and glassware. Most importantly, Essay B's environmental plan is appropriate: \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician.\" In contrast, Essay A demonstrates a significant flaw; after correctly identifying copper (II) sulphate as hazardous, it states an incorrect disposal method: \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain.\" This contradiction highlights a critical weakness in experimental safety protocol, solidifying Essay B's superiority.",
