  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all evaluated aspects of Criterion B. The fundamental difference begins with the research question. Essay B presents a highly focused and detailed research question: \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy.\" This question is specific, naming the reactants, the independent variable (temperature), the dependent variable (rate constant), and a clear analytical goal (activation energy). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is broad and lacks specificity regarding the salts, anions, or temperature range.\n\nThis initial strength in Essay B is reinforced by its comprehensive background section, which delves into \"collision theory,\" the \"Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve,\" and the \"Arrhenius equation,\" providing a robust theoretical foundation for the investigation. Essay A's background is superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility. Furthermore, Essay B's identification and explanation of variables are precise and correct. It clearly states the independent variable as \"Temperature of the system\" and the dependent variable as \"The rate constant (k) of the reaction.\" Essay A, however, demonstrates confusion by incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable, which fundamentally misunderstands its role in determining solubility.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations marks the most significant difference. Essay B provides a detailed table with specific chemical hazards (\"Oxalic acid may be very hazardous when in contact with skin\") and explicitly addresses both ethical (\"There were no ethical issues, as no live organisms were used\") and environmental concerns, including specific disposal protocols for a hazardous product (\"The solution was carefully disposed of as a hazardous waste\"). Essay A offers only a generic safety note and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical failure for an experimental investigation.",
