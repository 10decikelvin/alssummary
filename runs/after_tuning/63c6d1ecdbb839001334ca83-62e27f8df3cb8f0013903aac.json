  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed investigations. Essay A provides a clear research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...\", a solid methodology with specified concentrations and volumes, and a good analysis of variables and potential errors. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of complexity and thoroughness. Its research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...\", is more sophisticated. The background information in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, explaining the reaction mechanism and the Arrhenius equation, which is central to the investigation. Furthermore, Essay B includes a dedicated section on \"Preliminary Testing,\" which shows a more rigorous and refined experimental design process. The safety section in Essay B is also more comprehensive, breaking down the specific hazards for each chemical used, whereas Essay A's is slightly more general. While Essay A is very competent, Essay B's greater depth in theory, methodology, and safety analysis makes it the stronger submission.",
