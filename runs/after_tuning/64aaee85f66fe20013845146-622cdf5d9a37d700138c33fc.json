  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher quality of exploration and is the superior essay. Its strength begins with a well-formulated and specific research question that seeks to establish a relationship: \"how the amount of saturated fatty acids present in different oils affect the formation of AGEs, hence the rate of the Maillard Reaction.\" This is far more focused than Essay A's research question, which is presented as a title: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\". Furthermore, Essay B's background section is exemplary, not only providing relevant information but also using it to directly justify its methodology. For instance, it explains the choice of measurement wavelength by stating, \"brown... corresponds with a violet-blue as its complementary colour... From the visible light spectrum... it can be seen that this violet-blue corresponds with 420 nm,\" which demonstrates a deep, integrated understanding of the scientific principles at play.\n\nWhile both essays feature detailed procedures and well-structured variable tables, Essay B's is more sophisticated. Its controlled variables table includes a column for \"Possible Effects on Results,\" which shows a higher level of critical thinking about the experimental design. For example, it notes, \"As the Maillard Reaction is highly dependent on temperature and time, even a slight variation... could change the rate of reaction.\" Essay A's methodology is clear and appropriate, but Essay B's integration of cited literature and complex preparation (e.g., buffer solution) shows a more advanced level of scientific engagement.\n\nBoth essays are weak in their consideration of all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Essay A provides specific chemical safety advice, noting that one should \"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane as it can cause several skin issues and irritations.\" Essay B's risk assessment is present but more brief. Critically, both essays completely omit any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. However, the omission in Essay A is more significant, as it fails to address the proper disposal of dichloromethane, a hazardous chlorinated solvent, which is a major environmental oversight in an experimental context. Ultimately, Essay B's superior research question, deeply integrated background, and more sophisticated approach to variables far outweigh its weaknesses, making it the better submission.",
