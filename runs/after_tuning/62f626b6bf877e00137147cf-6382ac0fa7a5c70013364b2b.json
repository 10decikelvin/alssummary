  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources: chalk, rangoli powder, and seashells, as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\", is clear, focused, and appropriately detailed, specifying the substances, property to be measured, and the comparative methods. In contrast, Essay A's question is awkwardly phrased and lacks specificity on the range of the independent variable (\"depending on the expiration date?\"). Furthermore, Essay B provides a thorough background section that not only gives chemical context with equations but also offers a personal justification for the choice of samples and methods. Essay A's background is almost non-existent, consisting of a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\".\n\nMethodologically, Essay B excels by providing two distinct, detailed procedures appropriate for its research question and by explicitly identifying its variables in a comprehensive table, detailing how each is controlled. Essay A's methodology is critically flawed as it fails to describe how milk samples of different ages (the independent variable) would be sourced or managed, and it completely omits any identification of variables. Lastly, while both are experimental investigations and include safety sections, Essay B's is more specific, explaining the 'why' behind its precautions (e.g., \"The excess HCl and sample solution were properly disposed of within the lab itself, since dumping them outside may affect soil pH...\"). Essay A's safety points are generic and its environmental note lacks specific detail. Due to its thoroughness, clarity, and completeness, Essay B is the much stronger submission.",
