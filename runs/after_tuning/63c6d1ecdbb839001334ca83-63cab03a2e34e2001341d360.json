  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the scientific method and experimental design, making it the superior submission. Its research question, 'How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?', is highly focused, clearly defining the independent variable (pH with specific levels), dependent variable (mass of iron), and the precise method of measurement (titration). In contrast, Essay B's research question, 'How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?', is confusing as it mentions 'secondary data' but then describes a primary data collection experiment. Furthermore, 'pollution level' is a poorly defined, qualitative independent variable. Essay A's methodology is presented in a clear, step-by-step format with precise measurements, including a detailed table of apparatus with correct uncertainties. Essay B's methodology is a dense block of text with questionable uncertainties (e.g., 'Pipette (\u00b1 0.5 ml)'). While both essays include safety precautions, Essay A's are more specific and practical, detailing disposal methods for specific chemicals like KMnO\u2084. Essay A also excels in its detailed 'Controlled variables' table, which not only lists variables but also justifies why and how they are controlled, a feature largely absent in Essay B. Finally, Essay A's inclusion of a well-considered 'Alternative Methodology' and 'Extension' demonstrates a deeper level of engagement and critical thinking.",
