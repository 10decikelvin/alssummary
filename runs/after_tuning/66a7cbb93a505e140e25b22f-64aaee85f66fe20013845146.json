  "reasoning": "Both essays describe valid experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and robust fulfillment of Criterion B requirements.\n\nEssay A's primary strength lies in its solid foundation. The research question, \"How do different active ingredients...in different brands of indigestion tablets...compare in the volume (cm3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\", is clearly phrased as a question and is highly specific, outlining the independent variable (brands/ingredients), dependent variable (volume of HCl), and the exact method (titration). The background information is highly relevant, explaining the chemistry of neutralization and crucially providing the balanced chemical equations for each reaction, which is a significant strength. Furthermore, Essay A is comprehensive in its considerations, explicitly addressing safety (\"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl\"), environmental factors (\"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker...hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes\"), and ethics (\"There are no ethical considerations...\"). A minor weakness is the identification of \"Mass of indigestion tablets\" as an independent variable, which is a conceptual error, but this is a small flaw in an otherwise strong submission.\n\nEssay B has a very strong section on variables, presented in a clear table with excellent justifications for control, such as controlling the \"Number of holes poked in the aluminum foil covering...To guarantee that all evaporation ratio is the same for all trials.\" The methodology is also appropriate. However, Essay B has significant foundational weaknesses. Its research question is phrased as a statement (\"Investigating the caffeine content...\"), not a formal question, which is a stylistic but important flaw. More critically, for an experimental investigation using a hazardous chemical like dichloromethane, it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations. The lack of discussion on the proper disposal of a chlorinated organic solvent is a major oversight.\n\nUltimately, Essay A is superior because it presents a more complete exploration. Its properly formulated research question, relevant chemical background, and comprehensive treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations outweigh the minor error in variable identification. Essay B's excellent handling of controlled variables cannot compensate for its poorly framed research question and, most importantly, its critical omission of required environmental and ethical sections.",
