  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is significantly more focused, detailed, and measurable. It specifies the independent variable with exact values and uncertainties: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 \u00b0C, 40.0 \u00b0C, 60.0 \u00b0C, 80.0 \u00b0C, 100.0 \u00b0C) affect its calcium content (in mg)...\". It also explicitly names the analytical technique: \"...by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is vague, failing to specify which anions, which group one metal, or the temperature range.\n\nSecond, the background information and methodology in Essay B are far more thorough and scientifically rigorous. Essay B provides a detailed explanation of the complexometric titration chemistry, including relevant equations and the function of the indicator. Its methodology is precise, with specific quantities like \"0.4653g of EDTA powder\" and \"20.00cm\u00b3 of 0.05moldm\u207b\u00b3 EDTA solution\", making the experiment replicable. Essay A's background is superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility, and its methodology lacks crucial details, such as the volume of solvent or the masses of salt used.\n\nThird, Essay B demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design through its identification of variables. The controlled variables are listed in a comprehensive table, explaining not just *what* will be controlled (e.g., \"Concentration of EDTA solution (0.05moldm\u207b\u00b3)\") but also *why* it is important (\"If a more diluted EDTA solution is used... it will be difficult to do the titration.\"). Essay A's variable section is confused, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and failing to list critical controlled variables like the volume of the solvent.\n\nFinally, Essay B properly addresses safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, as required for an experimental investigation. It details specific chemical hazards, such as from ammonia, and provides corresponding precautions like using a fume cupboard. It explicitly addresses ethics (\"No ethical precaution is being taken...\") and environment (\"This may reduce the tendency of food wastage...\"). Essay A's safety section is generic and, crucially, completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw.",
