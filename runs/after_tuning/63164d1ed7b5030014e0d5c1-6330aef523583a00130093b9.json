  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B based on the fundamental principles of experimental design outlined in Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is well-formulated, focused, and uses evaluative language (\"to what extent\") that sets up a clear quantitative investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\", is a less sophisticated yes/no question that frames the investigation as a verification exercise rather than an exploration.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the handling of variables. Essay A correctly and clearly identifies the independent variable (\"Time spent in the water bath\"), dependent variable (\"Vitamin C content\"), and a comprehensive list of controlled variables. Conversely, Essay B demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of experimental design by misidentifying its variables. It incorrectly lists the independent variable as \"Temperature change\" and the dependent variable as \"Different types of substances dissolved,\" which is the reverse of the actual experimental setup. This fundamental error severely undermines the quality of its exploration.\n\nFurthermore, the methodology in Essay A is appropriate and robust for its research question, employing redox titration, a standard and reliable technique. While Essay B's use of calorimetry is theoretically sound, its execution using simple polystyrene cups proved inadequate, a flaw the student admits in the evaluation: \"the temperature differences are too small to be considered... Perhaps, by using a calorimeter these problems could have been avoided.\" This highlights a significant weakness in the initial experimental design. Finally, Essay A provides a more complete assessment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations by explicitly addressing all three, whereas Essay B omits any mention of ethical concerns.",
