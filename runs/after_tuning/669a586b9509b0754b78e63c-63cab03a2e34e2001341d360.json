  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality and understanding across all aspects of Criterion B. The fundamental strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally clear and focused research question: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3...1.000mol dm^-3)...\". This RQ is highly specific, quantifying the independent variable (HCl concentration), the substance used (0.5g antacid), and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's research question is contradictory and vague: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes...by comparing secondary data...by using Winkler\u2019s method?\". It confusingly claims to use both secondary data and a primary experimental method.\n\nThis foundational strength in Essay A carries through to all other sections. Its background information is directly relevant, explaining the neutralization chemistry and collision theory pertinent to the investigation. Its methodology is well-structured, replicable, and includes pre-testing. The variables section is exemplary, using a table to detail not just *what* is controlled, but *why* and *how*. For example, regarding surface area, it states the plan is \"grounding into a fine powder\" to keep it controlled and small.\n\nEssay B's execution is much weaker. The independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is never quantified, relying instead on subjective descriptions like \"moderately polluted\". The methodology is presented as a dense, hard-to-follow block of text. Furthermore, Essay A provides a comprehensive treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. Its safety table is detailed, and its environmental section specifically addresses waste minimization and disposal: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\". Essay B has a good safety section but only offers a generic environmental statement (\"Laboratory standards were followed\") and completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a flaw in an experimental IA. Overall, Essay A presents a well-conceived, methodologically sound, and thoroughly considered investigation, whereas Essay B is built on a confusing premise and lacks clarity and detail in key areas.",
