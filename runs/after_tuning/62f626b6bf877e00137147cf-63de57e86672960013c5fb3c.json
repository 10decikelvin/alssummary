  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the core components of IB Criterion B. Essay B is unequivocally superior across every metric, demonstrating a thorough and well-planned scientific exploration, whereas Essay A is critically underdeveloped and incomplete.\n\nFirst, the research questions highlight the disparity in quality. Essay B presents a focused, detailed, and investigable question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". This RQ clearly defines the specific range of the independent variable and the precise measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is vague, lacking any specifics on how \"expiration date\" will be measured or varied.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay B is extensive, relevant, and scientifically sound, explaining the principles of electroplating with chemical equations and citing prior research. Essay A's background is virtually non-existent, comprising a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\". This fails to provide any necessary context for the investigation.\n\nThird, Essay B excels in its methodology and identification of variables. It includes a dedicated section that correctly identifies the independent, dependent, and multiple controlled variables, explaining not only *why* they must be controlled but *how*. For example, to control the distance between electrodes, it states it will use \"a wooden splint placed across the beaker... to ensure the same distance between the electrodes in each trial.\" Essay A completely fails to identify or discuss variables, a critical omission. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is detailed and replicable, whereas Essay A's procedure is a generic set of instructions for a single titration that does not explain how the independent variable (expiration date) would be tested.\n\nFinally, while both are experimental investigations, Essay B provides a more comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It explicitly addresses all three areas, offering specific disposal instructions for hazardous waste like copper sulfate: \"remainder pure copper sulphate solution can be heated up in an evaporating basin to form copper sulphate crystals\". Essay A provides a decent risk assessment for chemical handling but is generic on environmental disposal (\"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately\") and completely omits any mention of ethical considerations.\n\nIn summary, Essay B presents a model of a well-conceived scientific exploration, from its focused research question to its detailed methodology and thorough considerations. Essay A, by contrast, lacks the fundamental components of a valid investigation, making Essay B the far better submission.",
