  "reasoning": "Both submissions are experimental investigations. Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger foundation in its research question, background, and methodology. Essay A's research question is exceptionally clear and detailed: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This specificity provides a sharp focus for the entire investigation. In contrast, Essay B's question is clear but lacks this level of detail. Essay A further excels with a relevant and focused background that explains collision theory, which directly supports its hypothesis.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is superior. It outlines a single, appropriate procedure for its research question and presents a comprehensive table of controlled variables, explaining not just *what* will be controlled but also *why* and *how*. Essay B, while ambitious in comparing two methods, reveals significant procedural flaws. Most critically, it states that for titration, \"25 cm\u00b3 of the solution... was added to another conical flask labelled B, using a measuring cylinder,\" which is an inappropriate choice of equipment that severely compromises accuracy. Furthermore, the student acknowledges the thermal decomposition method was flawed because a Bunsen burner cannot reach the required temperature, stating, \"I deduced that the thermal decomposition would yield more inaccurate results due to this systematic error.\" This indicates a lack of sufficient preliminary research.\n\nFinally, Essay A provides a more complete treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It uses a detailed table for safety hazards and provides a specific disposal plan: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\". It also explicitly addresses ethics, stating, \"This experiment has no ethical considerations, other than keeping in mind the minimisation of waste.\" Essay B has a good safety section and mentions environmental disposal, but it completely omits any discussion of ethical considerations, which is a required component. Due to its superior research question, stronger theoretical background, more robust and appropriate methodology, and more complete consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors, Essay A is the better submission.",
