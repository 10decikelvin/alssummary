  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the scientific depth, methodological rigor, and comprehensive fulfillment of IB requirements.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is significantly more focused and detailed: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This specifies the exact conditions and variables being investigated. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", is clear but lacks this level of scientific specificity. Furthermore, Essay A's background is exceptional, providing a sophisticated theoretical framework by linking the investigation to Gibbs free energy, Le Chatelier's principle, and the Van't Hoff equation, which directly relates temperature to Kc. Essay B's background is merely descriptive, providing separate sections on dichloromethane and caffeine without deeply integrating them into a cohesive scientific context for the experiment.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology and control of variables are more rigorous. It includes preliminary experiments to refine the method, noting that \"nitric acid was added as it causes solutions of Fe\u00b3\u207a(aq) to have a paler colour\". The justification for controlling variables is rooted in chemical principles; for instance, the concentration of reactants is controlled because \"Changes in the volume and concentration of this reactant would\u2019ve changed the position of equilibrium\". Essay B's control of variables is weaker, with justifications based on observation rather than principle, such as controlling temperature because \"it was discovered during the experiment that the solvent reacts with the tea and causes bubbles to form.\"\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay A thoroughly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It provides specific disposal instructions, stating that \"Before discharge into sewage plants, iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\" Essay B, despite using a hazardous organic solvent, completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. This is a major flaw for an experimental investigation. While Essay B does mention safety precautions like \"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane\", the absence of the other two components makes it incomplete. Essay A's comprehensive approach to all aspects of the exploration phase makes it the far better essay.",
