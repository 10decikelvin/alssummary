  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A for Criterion B. The primary differentiator is the quality and specificity of the research question and the corresponding depth of the exploration. Essay B's research question is exceptionally detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2... in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light, through the use of Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometry (UV-Vis), for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This level of detail sets up a focused and sophisticated investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks any specific parameters.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is far more rigorous and demonstrates significant personal engagement. The inclusion of a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, where the student adjusts concentrations and timings based on initial observations, is a hallmark of a high-quality investigation. Essay A's methodology is straightforward, but its viability is severely undermined by its own evaluation, which states critical equipment failures: \"The calorimeters used were too old, therefore the copper vessels experienced a lot of current overloads, sometimes melted\" and \"A variable resistor was not working.\" This suggests a poorly planned or executed experiment. Essay B also excels in its identification and control of variables, providing a detailed table with thorough justifications, whereas Essay A's list is more basic.\n\nFinally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are more specific to the chemicals and procedures involved. It notes the need to wear gloves \"when handling H2O2 and MO to prevent chemical burns and exposure to carcinogens\" and addresses waste disposal by referencing IUPAC guidelines for hazardous chemicals. Essay A's safety points are generic (\"Wearing safety goggles\") and its environmental note (\"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\") lacks substance. Overall, Essay B presents a well-researched, meticulously planned, and highly focused investigation, far surpassing the quality of Essay A.",
