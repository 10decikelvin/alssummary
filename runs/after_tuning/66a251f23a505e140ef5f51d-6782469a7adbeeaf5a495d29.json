  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally superior due to its more thorough and explicit treatment of all required components, particularly safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nBoth research questions are excellent; they are focused, clear, and highly specific. Essay A asks, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\", clearly defining the independent variable's range. Similarly, Essay B's question is highly detailed, specifying the reaction, analytical method, and concentration range: \"...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". Both essays also provide robust, relevant background information and methodologies refined by preliminary trials. For example, Essay A's preliminary work identified an issue with reactant absorbance, leading to the justified addition of nitric acid, while Essay B's trials led to adjusting the concentration of Methyl Orange to \"obtain absorbance readings within the 0.1-2.0 useful range\". Their identification and control of variables are also exemplary, using detailed tables to explain both *why* and *how* each variable is controlled.\n\nThe primary difference lies in the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) aspects. Essay A addresses these in three distinct, specific sections. Its safety section goes beyond generic warnings to identify a specific procedural hazard: \"If potassium thiocyanate is heated too strongly... it may decompose and form cyanide gas,\" and explains the mitigation: \"To prevent the production of cyanide gas solutions were only heated at a safe temperature range and in water baths.\" It explicitly addresses ethical considerations (\"Ethical- It is crucial to use these chemicals ethically and responsibly...\") and provides specific environmental disposal advice (\"Before discharge into sewage plants, iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's treatment of S/E/E is less comprehensive. While its safety section is good, mentioning specific protections like \"googles were worn when the UV-Lamp was in operation,\" it does not contain a separate, explicit section on ethical considerations for conducting the experiment. Its environmental section is also slightly less specific than Essay A's, stating that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\" without detailing what those guidelines entail for the specific chemicals used. While both investigations are excellent, Essay A's more meticulous and complete fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements, especially the S/E/E section, makes it the stronger submission.",
