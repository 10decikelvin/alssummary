  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and well-structured approach to the experimental design, particularly in its treatment of variables and risk assessment, making it the superior submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is exemplary in its clarity and specificity, immediately defining the exact values of the independent variable to be tested. Its methodology is robust, integrating technology like \"Vernier LabQuest 2\" and \"Tracker Software\" to enhance precision. The true strength of Essay A lies in its variables section. The controlled variables are presented in a clear table that not only identifies the variable but details the precise method of control and, crucially, explains the potential impact on the results if not controlled. For example, for the \"Amount of Cornstarch,\" it states, \"Having different amounts of cornstarch would mean that different samples have more or less to polymerize, therefore changing the relative plastic properties.\" Furthermore, Essay A thoughtfully includes a section on uncontrolled variables, showing a high level of critical thinking about the experimental limitations. Its risk assessment is also excellent, providing specific safety measures (\"use heat resistant gloves\"), and thoughtful environmental and ethical considerations, such as the use of edible materials.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy.\", is also focused and appropriate. The background information provided is academically rigorous, demonstrating a strong grasp of chemical kinetics, collision theory, and the Arrhenius equation. However, its experimental design sections are weaker than Essay A's. While the variables are correctly identified, the justification for their control is generic. For instance, the safety measures are vague, stating only to use \"Very careful operations during the experiment and following the safety rules of the laboratory at all times,\" which lacks the specificity seen in Essay A. Although it correctly identifies the need for hazardous waste disposal, the overall risk assessment is less comprehensive.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay B has a slightly more sophisticated theoretical background, Essay A is superior in its meticulous planning and documentation of the experimental procedure. The clarity, detail, and justification in its variables section, coupled with a more specific and thoughtful risk assessment, showcase a more complete mastery of the Criterion B requirements.",
