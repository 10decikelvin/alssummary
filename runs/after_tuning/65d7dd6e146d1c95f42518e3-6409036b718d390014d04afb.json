  "reasoning": "Both essays present a clear research question, methodology, and address safety/ethical/environmental considerations. However, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and well-structured approach overall. Its research question is more specific, stating 'How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C, 29\u00b0C, 31\u00b0C, 39\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C) affect the oscillation period and rate of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, measured by the time taken for 10 complete oscillations?' which provides a clearer framework for the investigation than Essay A's 'How does the concentration of Bromate ions (BrO3-) affect the rate of reaction of a Briggs-Rauscher oscillating clock reaction?'. Essay B's methodology section is also superior; it details the concentrations of all reagents ('41.5g of potassium bromate', '4.4g of malonic acid', etc.) and provides a step-by-step procedure, which is more comprehensive than Essay A's general outline. Furthermore, Essay B's inclusion of visual aids like a diagram of the experimental setup and sample data graphs enhances the clarity and professionalism of the report, a feature absent in Essay A. Although Essay A's discussion of environmental concerns regarding chemical disposal is a good practice, its overall methodology lacks the precision and detail present in Essay B, making B the stronger submission.",
