  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much more thorough and complete approach to all aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A is its highly specific and focused research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This RQ clearly defines the specific ions, the units for both independent and dependent variables, and the precise measurement technique, setting a robust foundation for the investigation. In contrast, Essay B's RQ, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A provides a comprehensive background that directly supports the complex methodology, explaining d-orbital splitting, ligand exchange reactions, and the function of the spectrophotometer. While Essay B's background on redox titration is relevant, Essay A's theoretical framework is more advanced. Essay A also clearly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a detailed table, whereas Essay B's variable table is present but empty, a significant omission.\n\nMost critically, as both are experimental investigations, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is a major differentiator. Essay A addresses all three aspects with specific, relevant details. For instance, its environmental consideration states, \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life and is considered a pollutant \u2014 Only use necessary amount...\". Essay B, however, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental protocols, which is a major flaw for a lab-based investigation involving chemicals. This omission, combined with its less specific RQ and incomplete variables section, makes it substantially weaker than Essay A, which excels in all assessed areas.",
