  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations that fulfill the requirements of Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of depth, rigor, and scientific foresight.\n\nEssay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen (mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\" It is highly specific, providing exact ranges and uncertainties for its two independent variables. Essay A's research question is also strong and focused, but Essay B's is slightly more detailed.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the background information and the treatment of variables. Essay B's background not only explains the relevant chemical principles but also justifies the chosen methodology by comparing it to alternatives, stating, \"other methods exist... the current determinations method and fluorescence quenching method is widely used... Therefore, after thorough consideration I chose to use Winkler's titration\". This demonstrates a deeper level of research and critical thinking. Furthermore, Essay B's table of controlled variables is exemplary; for each variable, it explains *why* it must be controlled and *how* it was controlled. For example, for \"Exposure to atmospheric oxygen/air,\" it specifies, \"The main water solution was stored in a large BOD flask... all transfer pipette solutions were introduced under the surface of the solution\". Essay A identifies its variables correctly, but lacks this deep justificatory detail.\n\nFinally, while both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns, Essay B's approach is more specific regarding disposal, such as for concentrated sulfuric acid: \"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink.\" In contrast, Essay A's disposal plan is more general: \"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\". Although Essay A is a competent and well-structured investigation, Essay B consistently shows a higher degree of meticulous planning, justification, and scientific understanding, making it the better submission.",
