  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its rigorous scientific foundation, clear focus, and sophisticated experimental design. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the pseudo order of reaction...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3,\" is exceptionally detailed and focused, immediately establishing clear parameters for the investigation. In contrast, while Essay B's question is clear, the scope is simpler. The background section of Essay A is a major strength, as it not only explains the Photo-Fenton reaction and Beer-Lambert law but also critically engages with existing literature to identify a \"research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO.\" This demonstrates a high level of academic inquiry. Essay B's background explains the general concepts of calcium and EDTA titration but provides a less convincing scientific rationale for why heating would affect the titratable calcium content in a complex food matrix.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A again excels by explicitly detailing its preliminary trials, showing how the procedure was refined: \"during preliminary trials, aliquots were pipetted out every 15 minutes...It was observed that there was a major change between the first reading at t=0 and the second reading at t=15...Hence, aliquots were subsequently pipetted out every 4 minutes.\" This demonstrates thoughtful experimental development. Essay A's control of variables is also more scientifically insightful, explaining *why* factors like surface area and outside light must be controlled. While Essay B has a comprehensive list of variables and safety precautions, its choice of a complex sample (flavored milk) introduces numerous uncontrolled variables (sugars, proteins, other minerals) that could interfere with the titration, a critical flaw not addressed in the methodology. Finally, both essays address safety and environmental concerns appropriately for their experimental context, but Essay A's overall scientific depth and rigor make it the better piece of work.",
