  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it demonstrates a more thorough and well-considered experimental design across all elements of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is more detailed and focused than Essay B's, specifying sample volume and the inclusion of multiple water sources. Essay A\u2019s methodology is also more robust, outlining a complex chemical titration (the Winkler Method) and comparing it to an instrumental technique (oxygen probe), which shows a higher level of engagement. Crucially, its control of variables is more rigorous; for instance, it specifies temperature control using \"a water bath of which was set to keep temperature constant at 10\u00b0C,\" which is a far more precise method than Essay B\u2019s vague statement about conducting trials in \"the same room with the same temperature.\"\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's treatment of safety and environmental considerations is significantly more specific and detailed. It identifies risks from specific chemicals like \"sulphuric acid\" and \"Iodine solution\" and provides concrete disposal plans, such as stating that \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation so it minimises the risk to the environment.\" In contrast, Essay B's environmental plan is generic: \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician,\" lacking any detail on the nature of the waste or the rationale for this disposal method. While Essay B presents a valid investigation with relevant background information, Essay A's more complex design, stronger variable control, and superior attention to safety and environmental protocols make it the better example of exploration.",
