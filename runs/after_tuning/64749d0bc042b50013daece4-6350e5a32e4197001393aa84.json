  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B due to its highly focused research question, rigorous scientific background, and meticulous experimental design. Essay A\u2019s research question is exceptionally strong, as it is not just clear but highly detailed, specifying the exact ranges for both independent variables: \"varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C))\". In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen... from different water sources,\" is vague on the concentration range and introduces a major uncontrolled variable (\"different water sources\") that fundamentally weakens the investigation. Furthermore, Essay A\u2019s background information provides a deep, scientifically-grounded explanation for its hypothesis, citing concepts like intermolecular forces (\"The interaction between water and oxygen is through a dipole \u2013 induced dipole intermolecular bond... when Nacl is added... it dissociates to form Na\u207a and Cl\u207b, both these ions form a stronger dipole-dipole interaction\"). Essay B's background is relevant but lacks this chemical depth. Essay A\u2019s methodology is also more robust, particularly in its identification and justification of controlled variables; for example, it explains precisely why pressure must be controlled: \"Dissolved oxygen increases with an increase in atmospheric pressure due to the increase in hydrostatic pressure\". Essay B's justifications are generic, such as stating that changing volumes \"would make the results unreliable and give anomalous results.\" While both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations for an experimental investigation, Essay A\u2019s stronger foundation in its research question, background, and variable control makes it the better submission.",
