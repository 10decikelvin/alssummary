  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the quality of the research question and the thoroughness of the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3...1.000mol dm^-3)... in 2 minutes?\". This level of detail, specifying variable ranges and measurement parameters, provides a clear and focused framework for the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", is clear but lacks this high degree of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is more scientifically rigorous, explaining the specific neutralization reactions and linking them to collision theory to build a hypothesis. Essay A's background is relevant but more descriptive. Methodologically, Essay B demonstrates superior experimental design by including a \"Pre-test\" section, showing how the procedure was refined based on preliminary results. Most critically, Essay B comprehensively addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. It provides a detailed safety table and explicitly states its approach to waste minimization and disposal, noting, \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\". It also correctly addresses ethics: \"This experiment has no ethical considerations...\". Essay A includes adequate safety precautions for handling dichloromethane but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a major flaw for an experimental investigation using a hazardous chlorinated solvent.",
