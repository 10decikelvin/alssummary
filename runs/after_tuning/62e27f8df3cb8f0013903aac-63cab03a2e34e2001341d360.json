  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior due to its exceptionally clear and focused research question, which underpins a methodologically sound and well-justified investigation. Essay A's research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\", is a model of specificity. It clearly defines the independent variable with a precise range, the dependent variable, the measurement technique, and the ultimate goal. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\", is confusing and contradictory, as it mentions using \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of preliminary testing, which informed its final design. For instance, it notes, \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data in the colorimeter, so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. Essay B describes a valid chemical procedure (Winkler's method) but its overall experimental design, comparing four locations with qualitatively assessed pollution levels, is less rigorous. The variables section in Essay A is also more detailed, explaining not just what will be controlled, but precisely how and why, such as controlling concentration to \"ensure the same number of moles are used.\"\n\nFinally, while both essays provide strong safety assessments, Essay A offers more specific environmental considerations. For each chemical, it states, \"Do not wash down the sink... Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay B provides only a single general statement: \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals to avoid release into the environment.\" The superior clarity of the research question, the rigorous experimental design informed by preliminary work, and the detailed justification of variables make Essay A the stronger example of Criterion B.",
