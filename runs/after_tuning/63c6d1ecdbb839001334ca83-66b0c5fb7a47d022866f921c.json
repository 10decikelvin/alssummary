  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B. However, Essay A is slightly superior due to its meticulous attention to detail and demonstration of a more thorough experimental design process.\n\n**Research Question:** Both essays present clear, focused, and well-defined research questions. Essay A's question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is exemplary. It explicitly states the independent variable with its range (pH 2.0 to 6.0), the dependent variable (mass of iron(II)), and the precise method of measurement (titration), leaving no room for ambiguity. Essay B's question is also strong but slightly less specific, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\".\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Both provide relevant background information that logically leads to the research question. Essay A's background is particularly robust, including the relevant chemical equations and a calculation to justify the concentration of KMnO\u2084 used. Its methodology is detailed, reproducible, and includes a \"What was changed\" section, which demonstrates an excellent level of student engagement and refinement of the procedure based on preliminary work. Essay B also presents a solid methodology appropriate for its question, with a well-justified selection of concentrations and a clear procedure for calorimetry.\n\n**Variables:** Both essays excel in defining their variables. Essay B's use of a table for controlled variables with columns for \"Why\" and \"How\" is particularly clear and effective. Essay A also clearly identifies and explains how to control its variables adequately.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays address these aspects well. Essay A provides specific safety precautions for handling HCl and glassware. Its environmental consideration is specific, noting that KMnO\u2084 is toxic to aquatic life and must be disposed of in a designated waste container. It also includes a thoughtful ethical consideration regarding the minimization of chemical waste. Essay B also provides appropriate safety measures, such as using a fume hood, and correctly identifies the need for proper disposal of gasohol mixtures. Its ethical consideration is weaker, simply stating \"No ethical considerations were considered.\"\n\nOverall, while Essay B is very strong, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and personal engagement, especially in the justification of its methodology and the detail within its research question and background information. This makes it the stronger of the two.",
