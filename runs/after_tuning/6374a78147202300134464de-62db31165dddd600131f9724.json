  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably better because it presents a complete and viable experimental plan, whereas Essay B is critically incomplete. While Essay B begins with a stronger background section that masterfully connects biological relevance to the specific chemical methodology (\"To measure ascorbic acid concentration ascorbic acid will be oxidized with iodine... A redox titration may be undertaken\"), its exploration section is unfinished. Essay B fails to provide a methodology, a list of variables, or any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, as the document cuts off after the variable table header. In contrast, Essay A provides a full, though basic, methodology. It clearly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a table, for example, listing \"Room temperature\" as a controlled variable and stating it was \"kept at a constant of 22\u00b0C\". Furthermore, Essay A addresses all required safety, ethical, and environmental points, stating for safety, \"I also wore gloves and laboratory glasses,\" and for environmental disposal, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain.\" Although Essay A's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", could be more specific about the concentration range, it is a complete question for a fully outlined investigation. The fatal incompleteness of Essay B's core experimental design sections makes Essay A superior by default.",
