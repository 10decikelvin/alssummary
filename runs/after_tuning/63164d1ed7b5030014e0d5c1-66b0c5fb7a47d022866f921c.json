  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of quality across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is supported by a more thorough and sophisticated background. It successfully situates the investigation within a compelling real-world context of fuel efficiency and environmental impact, providing balanced chemical equations for both octane and ethanol combustion to justify the inquiry. Essay A's background on vitamin C and titration is relevant but lacks the contextual depth of Essay B.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B excels in its identification and control of variables. The use of a table to detail each controlled variable, explain *why* it needs controlling, and specify *how* it will be controlled is exemplary. For instance, it justifies controlling the source of E10 fuel because \"The percentage of ethanol present must be kept constant\" and details the control method as \"purchasing all of the E10 (500ml) off of the same gas station\". Essay A identifies appropriate variables, but with less detailed justification for their control.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects is more rigorous. Both are experimental labs, and both correctly address all three areas. However, Essay B's environmental consideration is far superior, stating a specific action: \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company.\" In contrast, Essay A's claim of \"No significant environmental concerns\" is a weakness, as it dismisses the need for proper disposal of chemical reagents like iodine solution. Similarly, Essay B's safety plan is highly specific to the experiment's risks, mandating that \"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\". While Essay A's safety points are valid, they are less tailored to its specific procedure. Overall, Essay A is competent, but Essay B is more detailed, better justified, and more scientifically rigorous in its planning.",
