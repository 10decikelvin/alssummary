  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior because it demonstrates a more thorough and methodologically sound approach to scientific investigation. The research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in varying temperatures?\", is more focused and analytical than Essay A's. Essay B provides a comprehensive background section that explains the underlying chemistry, justifies the chosen method (Winkler titration), and compares it to alternatives. The methodology is detailed and clearly outlines the independent variable (temperature), dependent variable (DO concentration), and controlled variables (pressure, salinity). In contrast, Essay A lacks this explicit identification and detailed background. Furthermore, while both essays address safety, Essay B's safety section is more specific, naming the chemicals used and their associated risks (e.g., \"alkali-iodide-azide \u2013 Very corrosive\"). Finally, Essay B's inclusion of insights from preliminary trials demonstrates a more robust experimental design process. Essay A's plan is acceptable but less detailed and sophisticated in comparison.",
