  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it provides a comprehensive and well-structured exploration that meets the IB criteria, whereas Essay B is fragmented and critically deficient in several key areas.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly specific and focused two-part research question: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\". This is exemplary because it clearly defines the ranges of the independent variables. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"...how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is vague, failing to specify the range or intervals of the \"expiration date\" being tested. Furthermore, Essay A's background section is relevant and detailed, explaining concepts like homologous series and calorimetry, while Essay B provides no discernible background information at all.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology and variable identification are thorough. It presents a complete, step-by-step procedure and a detailed variables table that not only identifies controlled variables but also explains *why* and *how* they are controlled (e.g., for the calorimeter, \"The same calorimeter was used for every trial.\"). Essay B, on the other hand, presents an incomplete procedure starting at step 6 and completely omits a variables section, a critical failure for Criterion B.\n\nFinally, regarding safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, both essays are experimental and thus require this section. Both provide strong, specific safety assessments; for instance, Essay A notes the risk of \"Spillage of alcohols\" and Essay B warns that \"EDTA... [is] very corrosive\". However, Essay A fails to address environmental impact, a clear omission. Essay B successfully includes an environmental consideration, stating to \"[d]ispose of chemical waste appropriately to avoid chemicals being poured down the drain\". Despite this single advantage for Essay B, its foundational weaknesses\u2014a vague research question, no background, an incomplete method, and no variables section\u2014render it a far weaker piece of work. Essay A\u2019s robust and complete exploration in all other aspects makes it the superior essay.",
