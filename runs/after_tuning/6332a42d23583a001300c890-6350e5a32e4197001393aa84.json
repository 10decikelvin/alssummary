  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its focused research question, strong theoretical background, and sound experimental design, which are foundational to Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is clear, focused, and directly leads to a feasible and scientifically valid investigation. Its background section effectively explains the underlying principles of chemical kinetics, collision theory, and the Arrhenius equation, creating a robust theoretical framework that justifies the methodology. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources...\", is fundamentally flawed because it introduces a confounding variable (\"different water sources\"), making it impossible to isolate the effect of salinity alone.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is entirely appropriate for its research question, detailing a classic kinetics experiment with clear procedures for controlling variables. Essay B's background information fails to explain the key scientific principle of why salinity affects dissolved oxygen, a critical omission. While Essay B's safety and environmental sections offer slightly more specific control measures, for example stating acids \"will be disposed after neutralisation,\" this minor advantage cannot compensate for the significant weaknesses in its core scientific planning. Essay A's approach is methodical and scientifically rigorous, from its well-justified choice of reaction (noting it is second order) to its clear identification of all variables. Essay B's flawed experimental design and weaker theoretical background place it at a much lower level of achievement for this criterion.",
