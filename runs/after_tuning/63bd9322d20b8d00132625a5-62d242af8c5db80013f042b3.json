  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions and methodologies. Essay A's RQ, 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion?', is solid but could benefit from explicitly stating the measured variable (e.g., temperature change of water). Essay B's RQ, 'How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 \u00b0C, 40.0 \u00b0C, 60.0 \u00b0C, 80.0 \u00b0C, 100.0 \u00b0C) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?', is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying the independent variable's range and the dependent variable's measurement method. The background information in Essay B is more thorough, directly linking concepts like EDTA titration to the research question. While both have well-structured methodologies, Essay B's inclusion of a detailed procedure for preparing solutions ('1. 0.4653g of EDTA powder is measured out...') adds a layer of precision missing from Essay A's more generalized steps ('Weigh out the required mass...'). Both students address safety, but Essay B's safety section is more comprehensive, detailing specific risks like ammonia inhalation and providing specific mitigation strategies. Essay B also thoughtfully considers environmental impacts ('waste management'), whereas Essay A's mention is more generic. Ultimately, Essay B is superior due to its more detailed and well-defined research question, clearer methodology, and more thorough risk assessment.",
