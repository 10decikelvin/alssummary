  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it provides a complete and high-quality exploration, whereas Essay B is incomplete and lacks critical components of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is exceptionally strong, stating, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question is highly specific, detailing the exact independent variable values and how the dependent variable will be quantified. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks the necessary detail regarding variable ranges or measurement techniques.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A presents a comprehensive and well-justified methodology. The section \"Choice of Materials and Method\" thoughtfully explains the selection of the lux sensor over other options, and the control variables are meticulously outlined in a table with reasons and methods for control. Essay B's provided text cuts off before any methodology or detailed variables section, presenting only an incomplete table header, which is a critical omission.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are essential for an experimental investigation. It identifies specific chemical hazards (e.g., \"Potassium bromate(V) (KBrO\u2083) (TOXIC, OXIDISING)\"), lists mitigation measures (\"experiment is performed in the fume cupboard\"), and details environmental actions, such as how \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" Essay B provides no such section, a major failure for an experimental report. While both essays offer relevant background information, Essay A's thoroughness in all other aspects of experimental design makes it unequivocally superior.",
