  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more focused, detailed, and methodologically sophisticated approach to the investigation, which are key markers of excellence in Criterion B.\n\nFirstly, Essay B's research question is significantly stronger and more detailed than Essay A's. Essay B specifies the exact values and range for the independent variable: \"How does the temperature... at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content...\". In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen...\", is less precise, lacking a specified range for the salt concentration and introducing a confounding variable (\"different water sources\") that broadens the scope without adding focus.\n\nSecondly, Essay B provides a more thorough and relevant background, including a \"Comparison of Method\" section that justifies the choice of complexometric titration over alternatives like FAAS. This demonstrates a deeper level of preliminary research. While Essay A's background on the Winkler method is correct, Essay B's exploration of a more complex analytical technique and its justification shows greater personal engagement and understanding.\n\nThirdly, Essay B's identification and control of variables are more comprehensive. It presents an extensive table of controlled variables, such as \"Time taken for the... milk heated,\" with clear explanations for why control is necessary. Essay A identifies its variables correctly, but the level of detail and justification in Essay B is far greater.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations appropriately for experimental work, Essay B's is more specific. For example, it explains the specific risks of ammonia (\"ammonia gas will be released...is irritating and corrosive\") and includes a thoughtful environmental point about minimizing food wastage. Essay A's safety points are good, such as noting that \"Sulfuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin,\" but Essay B's overall treatment of these aspects feels more thorough and integrated into the experimental plan.",
