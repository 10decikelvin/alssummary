  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question\u2014\"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\"\u2014is exceptionally well-formulated, specifying the independent variable with its range, the dependent variable, the active agent, and the precise analytical technique. In contrast, Essay A's research is split into two simpler questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", which lack the same level of detail and specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is more focused and demonstrates a deeper engagement with the topic, directly justifying methodological choices. For instance, it explains the selection of the pH range by noting that \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4,\" a critical detail that shapes the entire experiment. While Essay A's background on thermochemistry is relevant, it is more general and less integrated with the specific methodological design.\n\nThe methodology and variable control in Essay B are exemplary for an experimental investigation. It includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear justifications for each, such as \"Brand of Oranges used\" and \"Shaking speed (400 rpm)\", and even details preliminary trials that informed the final procedure. Essay A, being a data-based investigation, has a simpler methodology; its control to use \"only linear primary alcohols\" is appropriate, but it does not showcase the same level of rigorous experimental design and problem-solving as Essay B.\n\nFinally, as an experimental essay, Essay B correctly includes a specific section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, noting proper disposal methods: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\". Essay A, as a data-based investigation, is not penalized for omitting this section, but Essay B's thoroughness in meeting the requirements for its investigation type further highlights its superior quality. Overall, Essay B exhibits a much higher level of scientific rigor, detail, and personal engagement in its exploration.",
