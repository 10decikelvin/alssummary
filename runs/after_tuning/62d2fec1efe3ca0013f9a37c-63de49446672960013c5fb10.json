  "reasoning": "Essay B is stronger across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is more focused and detailed than Essay A's (\"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\"). Essay B specifies the substance, its source, and uses evaluative language (\"to what extent\"), which is a hallmark of a sophisticated research question.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is substantially more thorough and demonstrates a deeper level of research. It expertly weaves together concepts from organic chemistry (structure of pyridoxine), coordination chemistry (copper complexes), and analytical chemistry (spectrometry, Beer-Lambert law), showing a clear understanding of the principles behind its chosen methodology. Essay A's background is relevant but covers more standard textbook concepts like collision theory and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is superior due to its demonstrated personal engagement and problem-solving. The inclusion of a \"Development and pilot studies\" section, where the student addresses issues like insolubility and precipitation by incorporating filtration and micelle formation, is exemplary. Essay A's methodology is appropriate but standard, and a potential flaw is noted in the evaluation (\"I used 1 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of each acid...I could have used 2 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of HCl and 1 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of H\u2082SO\u2084\") rather than being addressed during the design phase.\n\nFinally, while both essays have good safety and environmental considerations, Essay B explicitly addresses all three components (Safety, Ethical, Environmental), whereas Essay A omits any mention of ethical considerations. Essay B also provides a more comprehensive list of controlled variables, such as \"The same cuvette will be used for every trial,\" indicating a more meticulous approach to experimental design.",
