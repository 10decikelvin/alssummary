  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating solid experimental design. However, Essay A is superior due to its exceptional precision in the research question and a more robust justification for its experimental parameters.\n\nEssay A's research question is exemplary in its detail: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This question is fully operationalized, including the specific independent variable values, the reactant mass, the measurement method, and the time frame. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is clear but lacks the same level of embedded detail, requiring the reader to look elsewhere for the specific volumes and mass ranges.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by a clear account of pre-testing which directly influenced the choice of independent variable values, stating, \"I decided to use lower concentrations of HCl in order to achieve a clearer trend.\" This demonstrates an iterative and thoughtful approach to the experimental design. Its controlled variables are also presented in a highly organized table with \"What,\" \"Why,\" and \"How\" columns, which is clearer than Essay B's table. Finally, Essay A's environmental considerations are slightly stronger as they are explicitly linked to stoichiometry to minimize waste: \"I used the stoichiometric ratios acquired from the chemical reaction equations in section 2.1... I calculated the minimum volume of HCl needed\".\n\nWhile Essay B is a very good investigation with strong personal engagement and thorough safety and environmental sections, Essay A's foundational elements\u2014the research question and the justification for the methodology\u2014are more precise and rigorously explained, giving it the edge.",
