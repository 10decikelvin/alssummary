  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior due to its rigorous and well-considered experimental design, a stark contrast to the fundamentally flawed approach in Essay A. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its high-quality research question: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\" This question is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, specifying the exact levels of the independent variable and the precise measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's research question is functional but lacks this level of specificity.\n\nThe most significant difference is in the methodology and control of variables. Essay B presents a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear justifications, demonstrating a strong understanding of experimental design. Conversely, Essay A contains a critical flaw that undermines its entire investigation. The author explicitly states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet... When a person takes a tablet, he does not change the mass... so to give a realistic answer, the mass of each tablet will be kept as is.\" This reasoning is scientifically unsound; failing to control for the mass of the reactant makes it impossible to compare the chemical effectiveness of the different active ingredients, which is the goal of the investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is scientifically robust, and its methodology is appropriate for the research question. While Essay A also provides relevant background and addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, its choice of a direct titration for carbonate antacids is less appropriate than a back-titration, which would yield more accurate results. Ultimately, the superior research question and, most importantly, the sound and well-controlled experimental design of Essay B make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
