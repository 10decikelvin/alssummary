  "reasoning": "While both essays present viable experimental investigations, Essay A demonstrates a superior approach to Criterion B. Essay B's primary strength is its highly focused research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", and its excellent background section, which uses Gibbs free energy calculations to scientifically justify the reaction's feasibility. However, its methodology contains a critical flaw; it investigates the effect of concentration by testing only two values: \"The concentration of copper (II) sulphate solution was shifted from 0.5M to 1.0M\". An investigation based on only two data points is insufficient to establish a meaningful relationship or trend, which fundamentally undermines the exploration.\n\nEssay A, in contrast, presents a much more robust experimental design. Although its research question is slightly less focused by including two independent variables (NaCl concentration and water source), its methodology is designed to collect sufficient data to analyze a trend, as shown in the provided graphs. The plan to compare two different measurement techniques (Winkler method and oxygen probe) also shows a higher level of investigative thought. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is significantly more detailed and specific. For instance, Essay A notes specific chemical hazards and disposal methods: \"Sulfuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin\" and \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\". This is far superior to Essay B's generic statement, \"I also wore gloves and laboratory glasses when carrying out the experiment,\" and its questionable environmental practice of disposing of copper (II) sulphate \"down the drain\". Because Essay A presents a more scientifically valid experimental design and a more thorough consideration of safety and environmental impacts, it is the better essay for this criterion.",
