  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and thorough explorations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and methodological rigor.\n\n**Research Question:** Both essays have excellent, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". Essay B asks, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". Both clearly state variables, specific conditions, and measurement techniques.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** While Essay A provides a very competent background, including the necessary theory and a commendable description of the titration needed to find the bleach concentration, Essay B's background and methodological development are superior. Essay B's \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section is particularly strong, as it details the thought process and preliminary trials that led to the final procedure. For example, it explains the rationale for choosing a lux sensor over other methods: \"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... it only did so at an instant and did not log continuous data... a lux sensor... resulted in continuous and reliable data\". This demonstrates a more sophisticated level of independent thinking and problem-solving in the experimental design.\n\n**Variables and Controls:** Both essays do an excellent job of identifying and justifying their independent, dependent, and controlled variables in clear tables.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays are experimental and provide appropriate safety precautions. However, Essay B's environmental consideration is more thoughtful. While Essay A correctly notes that its chemicals required proper disposal (\"disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor\"), Essay B goes a step further by actively modifying the procedure to minimize waste: \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" This proactive approach to environmental impact shows a higher level of awareness and responsible planning.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A is a very strong and well-executed investigation. However, Essay B edges it out due to its superior demonstration of the scientific process, particularly in the detailed justification and development of its methodology, and its more proactive approach to environmental considerations.",
