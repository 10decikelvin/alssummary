  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and attention to detail across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" It clearly defines the independent variable with a precise range, the dependent variable, and a key controlled variable (time). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...?\" is clear but lacks the same level of quantitative detail.\n\nSecond, the identification and control of variables in Essay B are flawless, whereas Essay A contains a significant conceptual error. Essay A incorrectly identifies its independent variable as \"Mass of sample before titrating,\" when the independent variable is actually the source of the sample (chalk, seashell, rangoli) and the methodology used. Essay B correctly identifies its independent variable as \"Voltage (volts/V)\" and provides excellent justification for both the choice of variable and the range being tested. Furthermore, Essay B's discussion of controlled variables explains not only *what* will be controlled (e.g., \"Distance between the electrodes\") but also *how* it will be controlled (\"using a wooden splint... marked with either end of the beaker\").\n\nThird, Essay B's background research is more thorough, citing external studies and linking the investigation to established scientific principles like \"Faraday's first law of electrolysis\" to build its hypothesis. While Essay A's background is relevant, it is less comprehensive.\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a model handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It explicitly addresses all three sections separately. It correctly states, \"There are no ethical issues to be considered for this experiment,\" which is the proper way to address this criterion. Its environmental section is highly specific, suggesting methods like neutralizing acid (\"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\"). Essay A provides good safety and environmental details but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a notable flaw for an experimental investigation.",
