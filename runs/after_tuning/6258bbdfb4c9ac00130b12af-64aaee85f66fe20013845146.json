  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the overall scientific rigor, detail, and completeness. Essay A's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\", is highly specific, clearly outlining the exact range of the independent variable and the methods of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's question is clear but lacks this level of quantitative detail. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is exceptionally thorough, including sections on chemical preparation, standardization, and a \"Justification for methodology\" that explains procedural choices. Essay B's procedure is a simple list of steps lacking such detailed rationale.\n\nA critical weakness in Essay B is its incomplete handling of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations, which are mandatory for an experimental investigation. While Essay B lists some \"Safety Precautions,\" it entirely omits any mention of ethical or environmental impact. This is a significant flaw, especially given its use of dichloromethane, a hazardous chlorinated solvent. Conversely, Essay A excels in this area, providing a detailed risk assessment table and dedicated sections for ethical and environmental concerns. For example, Essay A states its environmental protocol: \"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\" This comprehensive approach in Essay A showcases a much deeper engagement with the practical and responsible aspects of scientific exploration, making it the clear winner. While Essay B outlines a functional experiment, Essay A presents a far more polished, detailed, and scientifically robust investigation.",
