  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and demonstrate strong performance in Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its more detailed research question, more thorough justification of methodological choices, and more comprehensive control of variables.\n\nEssay B's research question is exemplary: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\" It is highly specific, outlining the independent variable and its range, the dependent variable, the adsorbent, and the quantification method all within a single sentence. Essay A's question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is also strong and focused but lacks the same level of integrated detail.\n\nBoth essays feature excellent background information and demonstrate strong methodological development through pilot studies. However, Essay B's \"Preliminary Trials\" section provides a clearer rationale for key experimental parameters, such as why the pH range was limited to 1.0-5.0 to avoid precipitation and why a 30-minute adsorption time was chosen. Similarly, Essay B's presentation of controlled variables in a table with detailed justifications for their significance is more rigorous and clear than Essay A's list format. For example, Essay B explains *why* temperature must be controlled: \"Increasing the temperature of the system would cause an increase in the concentration of H\u2083O\u207a ions...reducing availability for Cu\u00b2\u207a ions.\"\n\nFinally, while both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay A has a slightly more specific safety section, noting the explicit hazards of each chemical: \"Copper(II) sulfate: copper(II) sulfate can cause irritation to the eyes...\". In contrast, Essay B's safety statement is more general: \"...solutions can cause irritation when in contact with eyes or skin.\" Despite this minor point, Essay B's superior performance in the core exploratory aspects\u2014the research question, methodological justification, and variable control\u2014makes it the stronger piece of work.",
