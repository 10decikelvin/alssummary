  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor across all assessed components. Essay B's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is supported by a sophisticated and highly relevant theoretical background. It correctly identifies the Arrhenius equation and derives the second-order integrated rate law, `1/c - 1/c\u2080 = kt`, which directly informs its methodology and data analysis plan. In contrast, Essay A's methodology contains a fundamental flaw that invalidates its results, a weakness the student themselves identify: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This means the titration measures total acidity, not just ascorbic acid, making the method inappropriate for the stated research question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's design is more thorough. It justifies its choice of temperature intervals, stating they are \"large enough to give us a noticeable change in the rate constants... allowing for the construction of a graph with a clear trend.\" This foresight is absent in Essay A. The most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides specific and relevant safety precautions for multiple hazards: \"Ethyl acetate is flammable... As sodium hydroxide is corrosive, gloves were worn at all times... temperatures were dangerously hot, such as 333 K\". It also explicitly addresses environmental disposal (\"ethyl acetate was flushed down the sink with large quantities of water\") and ethical issues (\"There were no notable ethical... issues\"). Essay A's safety section is dangerously minimal, omitting standard precautions like safety goggles, and completely fails to address ethical or environmental aspects, which is a critical omission for an experimental investigation. While Essay A's research question is clear, its flawed methodology and incomplete safety considerations make it significantly weaker than the chemically sound, theoretically robust, and procedurally complete investigation presented in Essay B.",
