  "reasoning": "Both essays describe competent experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of detail, thoughtfulness, and engagement with the experimental design process. Essay B's research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is highly specific and focused. Its background information provides a relevant and detailed explanation of heterogeneous catalysis and active sites, which is directly applicable to the investigation. The most significant strength of Essay B lies in its meticulous control of variables, presented in a clear table with justifications, such as controlling surface area by stating \"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" Furthermore, its environmental considerations are exemplary, referencing the \"12 Principles of Green Chemistry\" and specifying that waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\".\n\nEssay A presents a solid investigation with a clear research question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\". The background on redox titration is appropriate, and the methodology is standard and well-suited to the question. However, it falls short of Essay B's depth. For instance, while its safety precautions are adequate, its environmental section is a critical weakness, stating only \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is insufficient for a lab-based experiment involving chemical reagents. While Essay A's foundation is sound, Essay B's meticulous planning, justification for its unique methodological approach, and comprehensive handling of all Criterion B elements, particularly variable control and environmental impact, make it the stronger piece of work.",
