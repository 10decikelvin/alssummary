  "reasoning": "Both essays describe well-conceived experimental investigations, but Essay A demonstrates a superior quality of exploration. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its detailed justification for the methodology and its meticulous planning. The \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section explicitly details a process of trial and error, stating, \"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately... the built-in lux sensor in the data logger could determine the changes in colour.\" This narrative of refining the procedure embodies the spirit of exploration. Furthermore, Essay A's handling of variables is exemplary; its table specifies not only the control variable but also the \"Reason for Controlling\" and \"Method of Control,\" a level of detail that demonstrates a deep understanding of experimental design.\n\nEssay B is also a strong submission with a highly focused and detailed research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii... of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting...?\" The background information is relevant, and it correctly identifies safety, ethical, and environmental considerations for an experimental lab. However, it falls short of Essay A in its justification of the experimental design. The variables are simply listed, lacking the detailed rationale seen in Essay A. Additionally, while the methodology is present, it lacks the reflective element of overcoming preliminary challenges that makes Essay A's exploration so compelling. Both essays have excellent, specific research questions, but Essay A's thorough, well-documented, and reflective approach to developing its procedure and controlling variables makes it the stronger piece of work for Criterion B.",
