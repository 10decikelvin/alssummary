  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all evaluated elements of Criterion B. The foundation of Essay B's strength is its research question: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2...in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This question is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, specifying the analytical method, conditions, and variable ranges. In stark contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is vague and lacks the specificity required for a high-quality investigation.\n\nEssay B builds on this strong foundation with a deeply researched and relevant background section that not only explains the \"Photo-Fenton reaction\" but also provides a compelling real-world rationale related to industrial water pollution. Essay A's background is superficial, offering little more than a textbook definition of solubility. The methodological design in Essay B is far more sophisticated, highlighted by its \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to refining the procedure; for example, it explains the concentration of MO was adjusted because initial absorbance was \">2\". Essay A's methodology is adequate but lacks this level of scientific refinement.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of variables and safety. Essay B presents its controlled variables in a clear table, justifying why each is important and how it was controlled, such as using \"an opaque cardboard box...to prevent outside light from interfering with the experiment\". Essay A's variable section is confusing and incomplete, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable. Lastly, Essay B includes specific safety precautions (\"prevent chemical burns and exposure to carcinogens\") and addresses environmental impact by stating \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\". Essay A's safety notes are generic, and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, a critical failure for an experimental investigation.",
