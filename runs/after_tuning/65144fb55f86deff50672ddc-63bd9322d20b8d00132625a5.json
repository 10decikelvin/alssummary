  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a slightly more robust and well-considered experimental design within the constraints of a school laboratory.\n\nEssay A presents a well-defined research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10-12 m) of central metal ions...affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol)...\". The background information is thorough, explaining concepts like d-orbital splitting and ligand exchange. The methodology is appropriate, and the variables are correctly identified. However, the evaluation section reveals significant systematic errors, such as the assumption of octahedral geometry for all complexes (e.g., \"[Cu(NH3)4]2+ instead of the assumed [Cu(NH3)6]2+\"), which fundamentally impacts the validity of the results for at least one data point. Furthermore, the handling of safety and environmental considerations is somewhat generic, stating general precautions like wearing goggles and using a well-ventilated room.\n\nEssay B, while lacking a formal \"Background\" section, integrates the necessary theoretical context into its introduction and other sections. Its research question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", is clear, though it could benefit from specifying the range of masses. The methodology is straightforward and appropriate. A key strength of Essay B is its \"Strengths and Limitations\" section, which is presented in a clear table format. It astutely identifies significant sources of error like heat loss and incomplete combustion, proposes concrete improvements (\"Use a draught shield,\" \"use a different spectrophotometer\"), and correctly classifies errors as systematic or random. This demonstrates a deeper level of critical reflection on the experimental process compared to Essay A. While Essay A's discussion of uncontrolled variables is also good, Essay B's is more structured and detailed. The safety and environmental considerations in Essay B are also more specific, mentioning the need for ventilation due to soot and the non-biodegradable nature of paraffin wax.\n\nUltimately, while both students conducted reasonable investigations, Essay B shows a superior understanding of experimental design and error analysis. The structured evaluation of limitations and the specific, actionable improvements suggested demonstrate a more mature scientific thought process. Essay A's failure to account for the known variable geometry of the copper complex is a more significant flaw in its experimental design than the heat loss issues acknowledged in Essay B. Therefore, Essay B is the stronger submission.",
