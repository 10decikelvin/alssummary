  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally superior due to its more detailed and meticulous approach to experimental design and control. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-focused, stating not only the independent and dependent variables but also the specific values to be tested and the precise analytical method: \"How does the temperature... at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". This level of detail sets a clearer investigative path than Essay B's question, which is good but less specific. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables is exhaustive, with each variable linked to a clear method of control and a justification for why it's important. For instance, it correctly identifies \"Concentration of EDTA solution\" and explains, \"If a more diluted EDTA solution is used, Mg\u00b2\u207a ions may not be bonded as leftovers... therefore it will be difficult to do the titration.\" This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the experimental subtleties compared to Essay B's more general list of controls. Essay A also provides more specific safety precautions, such as stating \"Ammonia buffer is used in the fume cupboard\" due to the release of irritating ammonia gas, which is more robust than Essay B's more generic advice to follow \"the safety rules of the laboratory at all times.\"\n\nEssay B is still a very strong piece of work, particularly in its background section, which provides a sophisticated theoretical foundation by linking chemical kinetics, collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Arrhenius equation. This theoretical depth is impressive. Additionally, Essay B's environmental considerations are stronger, as it correctly identifies potassium hydroxide waste as hazardous and specifies its disposal method. However, its slightly less specific research question and less detailed justification for variable control and safety measures place it just behind Essay A. While both essays are excellent, Essay A's thoroughness in the practical design and risk assessment aspects of the investigation gives it the edge.",
