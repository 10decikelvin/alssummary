  "reasoning": "Both submissions present strong and well-structured investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to the requirements of Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Both essays have clear, focused, and well-formulated research questions. Essay A asks, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created.\" Essay B asks, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\" Both questions clearly state the independent and dependent variables and the method of measurement, making them equally strong in this regard.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Both essays provide relevant background information. Essay A's connection to the Maillard reaction in baking is well-explained, and its justification for using \"real food\" instead of \"model foods\" demonstrates good critical thinking. Essay B's background on anemia and the chemistry of iron solubility and redox titrations is also very thorough and scientifically sound. Both methodologies are detailed, logical, and appropriate for their respective research questions. Essay B includes a particularly strong section justifying its choice of titrant concentration, which shows excellent forethought.\n\n**Variables:** Both essays clearly identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Essay A's table of controlled variables is very well-organized and explains the potential impact of each variable not being controlled. Essay B's table is also comprehensive, listing numerous variables and how they will be controlled.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** This is the key area where Essay B excels. It provides specific, well-considered points for all three aspects. For safety, it notes that HCl is an irritant and glassware is fragile. For ethics, it addresses chemical waste: \"only the required amount of chemicals were provided... limiting the amount wasted.\" For environmental impact, it gives specific disposal instructions: \"Acidified KMnO4 should not be poured down the drain...it should be disposed into a sealable container.\" In contrast, Essay A only addresses safety (\"Oven (High Temperatures): Heat-proof gloves were worn\"). It completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant weakness for an experimental investigation.\n\nWhile both essays demonstrate a high level of understanding and planning, Essay B's comprehensive treatment of all required components, especially its detailed and specific consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental issues, makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
