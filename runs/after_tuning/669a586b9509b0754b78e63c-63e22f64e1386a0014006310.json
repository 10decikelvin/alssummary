  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong, well-structured investigations with clear and highly specific research questions. Essay B's two-part question is particularly ambitious and well-focused: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\". Similarly, Essay A's research question is exemplary in its detail, specifying the exact concentrations and measurement parameters: \"What is the average rate of reaction... of 0.5 g of crushed antacids... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". Both also provide relevant, focused background information and appropriate methodologies.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and refined experimental design process. It explicitly describes a \"Pre-test\" section, justifying the choice of variables: \"When pre-testing, I noticed that the rate of reaction... was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution, due to this I decided to use lower concentrations of HCl in order to achieve a clearer trend.\" This shows a higher level of personal engagement and scientific diligence in the planning stage.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A addresses all three aspects thoroughly and specifically for an experimental investigation. It discusses safety precautions for HCl, explicitly states that \"This experiment has no ethical considerations,\" and provides specific environmental disposal details: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water.\" In contrast, while Essay B has a solid safety section, it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental concerns, despite the section being titled \"Safety, Environment and Ethical Considerations.\" For an experiment involving the combustion and disposal of numerous organic alcohols, this is a critical flaw.\n\nDue to its more rigorous experimental planning (evidenced by the pre-test) and its complete and specific handling of all required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay A is the superior piece of work.",
