  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent experimental investigations, but Essay B is superior due to its exceptional detail and completeness across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question is a model of clarity and specificity, stating: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm\u00b3 s\u207b\u00b9) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO\u2083 and MgCO\u2083) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, 0.100 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, 0.250 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, 0.500 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, 1.000 mol dm\u207b\u00b3), measured through the production of CO\u2082 (cm\u00b3) in 2 minutes?\". This level of detail, specifying exact concentrations and measurement parameters, provides a much sharper focus than Essay A's otherwise solid question. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section, demonstrating a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design which is a hallmark of excellent exploration.\n\nThe most significant differentiator, however, lies in the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B addresses all three required components for an experimental investigation thoroughly. It provides a detailed safety table for each chemical and explicitly addresses the other two criteria, stating, \"This experiment has no ethical considerations...\" and detailing environmental protocol: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\". In stark contrast, Essay A completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw for an experimental IA. While Essay A presents a well-structured investigation with a clear aim, relevant background, and good variable control, Essay B's meticulous attention to detail in its research question and its complete fulfillment of the safety, ethical, and environmental requirements make it the demonstrably better submission for Criterion B.",
