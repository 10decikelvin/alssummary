  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong explorations for their respective investigations. Essay B, however, is marginally superior due to its more thorough and sophisticated approach across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nBoth research questions are excellent, being focused, specific, and measurable. Essay A asks, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\", while Essay B asks, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". Both clearly outline variables, concentrations, and measurement techniques.\n\nEssay B demonstrates a slightly deeper conceptual understanding in its background section by adeptly linking the equilibrium constant to Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Le Chatelier's principle, providing a more robust theoretical framework. While Essay A's background on kinetics and the Arrhenius equation is relevant and well-explained, Essay B's integration of multiple advanced concepts is more impressive. Furthermore, Essay B's two-part methodology, which involves creating a calibration curve before determining Kc, is a standard and highly appropriate technique for this type of investigation and is explained clearly.\n\nThe key differentiating factor is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this analysis. Essay A provides a very good table for safety and environmental disposal, stating for its chemicals to \"Dispose according to local legislation.\" However, it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations. Essay B excels here, addressing all three components distinctly and thoroughly. It details specific safety risks, like how potassium thiocyanate \"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas,\" and explicitly addresses ethics: \"It is crucial to use these chemicals ethically and responsibly.\" It also covers environmental impact: \"These chemicals may all pose a risk to aquatic organisms and may cause longterm adverse effects in the aquatic environment.\" This completeness makes Essay B a more well-rounded and diligent piece of scientific planning.",
