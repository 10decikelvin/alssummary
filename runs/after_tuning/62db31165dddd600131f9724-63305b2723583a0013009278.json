  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger across all aspects of the Exploration criterion. Its research question, 'How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?', is exemplary in its clarity and focus, precisely defining the independent and dependent variables while also stating a key control (time). In contrast, Essay A's question, 'What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?', is acceptable but lacks this level of specificity. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is detailed and its control of variables is explicitly outlined in a table, explaining *how* each variable is controlled. Essay A's variables section is weaker, failing to describe control methods and incorrectly identifying the dependent variable as the volume of titrant rather than the calculated concentration. Most critically, Essay B includes a thorough and specific safety and environmental considerations section, noting that 'Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic to aquatic organisms and hazardous to aquatic environment' and outlining proper disposal. Essay A's safety section is generic ('Safety goggles and a lab coat should be worn') and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation.",
