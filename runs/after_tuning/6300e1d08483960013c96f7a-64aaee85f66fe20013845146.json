  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its significantly more rigorous and detailed experimental design, methodology, and consideration of specific safety precautions. First, while both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's is more detailed, specifying not just the variables but the core technique: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea... using dichloromethane in a separating funnel.\" In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts... affect the volume of melted ice?\", is adequate but less specific about the methodology.\n\nSecond, the methodology in Essay B demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor. It outlines a complex liquid-liquid extraction with precise measurements and controls, such as waiting for the \"tea solution reaches 35\u00b0C\" and repeating the extraction step multiple times. Essay A's method is overly simplistic and lacks crucial controls; for instance, melting the ice in an open \"baker\" exposes the experiment to uncontrolled heat exchange with the surroundings. Furthermore, Essay B's controlled variables are more meticulous, exemplified by the instruction to \"Poke exactly 32 holes around the top of the foil covering\" to ensure a consistent evaporation rate, a level of detail absent in Essay A.\n\nFinally, Essay B includes specific and relevant safety precautions tailored to the chemicals used, stating the need to \"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane as it can cause several skin issues and irritations.\" Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, which is a critical flaw for an experimental investigation. Although both essays fail to explicitly address environmental considerations (a notable weakness for Essay B, given the use of a hazardous solvent like dichloromethane), Essay B's overwhelming strength in methodology, variable control, and safety makes it the better submission for Criterion B.",
