  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The foundation of Essay B's strength lies in its highly specific and focused research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This contrasts with Essay A's clear but less detailed question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", which does not specify the pH ranges being investigated within the question itself.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information and experimental design are far more sophisticated. It expertly weaves together complex concepts like Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and the Beer-Lambert law to justify its methodology. The inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" to refine the procedure shows a high degree of planning and scientific rigor. In contrast, while Essay A's methodology is appropriate, its plan for controlling variables is weaker, particularly for temperature, which is to be controlled by \"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard area away from sunlight\" for five days, a method far less precise than Essay B's use of a temperature-controlled water bath.\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a comprehensive and specific treatment of all required considerations. It details specific safety risks, such as \"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\" from potassium thiocyanate, explicitly addresses ethical considerations (\"It is crucial to use these chemicals ethically and responsibly\"), and provides detailed environmental disposal instructions (\"Before discharge into sewage plants, iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\"). Essay A has a solid safety section but completely omits any mention of ethics and provides a very generic environmental note: \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory.\" This comprehensive approach in Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and well-rounded exploration.",
