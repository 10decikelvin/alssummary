  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is far more focused and detailed. It states: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question is exemplary as it specifies the exact independent variable values and explicitly states how the dependent variable will be quantified. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity regarding measurement and scope.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology and background demonstrate superior scientific thinking. The background provides a rich context, linking the BZ reaction to collision theory, redox, and autocatalysis. Crucially, Essay B includes a \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that justifies the experimental design, explaining why a lux sensor was chosen over other methods: \"While the colourimeter was able to measure the colours... it only did so at an instant and did not log continuous data over time\". This shows thoughtful preliminary work. Essay A's methodology is fundamentally appropriate, but its procedure is presented in a chaotic, non-sequential order (e.g., starting with step \u2460, jumping to \u2464, then \u2465, then \u2462), making it extremely difficult to follow.\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B excels in its treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, whereas Essay A is severely deficient. Essay B identifies specific hazards for multiple chemicals (e.g., \"Potassium bromate... is a strong oxidizer, toxic if swallowed, and may cause cancer\") and details responsible waste management: \"resulting solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician.\" It even describes reducing the experiment's scale to minimize environmental impact. Essay A's safety section is incomplete\u2014it mentions acetic acid but omits the significant hazard of Sodium Hydroxide\u2014and entirely fails to address any environmental or ethical considerations, a major omission for an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal.",
