  "reasoning": "While both submissions show a basic understanding of experimental design, Essay A is superior due to its more complete and structured presentation. Essay A clearly states its research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", provides relevant background information citing sources, and lists the independent and dependent variables, even if the dependent variable could be stated more precisely. The methodology is presented as a full, step-by-step procedure. In contrast, Essay B is incomplete, starting mid-procedure (\"7. After 2 minutes, extinguish the candle...\"). It lacks a clear introduction, a defined research question (only implied by the title), and a list of variables, which are fundamental components of a scientific report. While Essay B offers a slightly more detailed consideration of environmental impact (\"Paraffin wax is not biodegradable, and its residue after it burns emits toxic fumes\"), the overall structure and completeness of Essay A make it a stronger example of scientific planning and communication. The presence of a full methods section in Essay A allows for a complete assessment of its viability, which is not possible for the partial information provided in Essay B.",
