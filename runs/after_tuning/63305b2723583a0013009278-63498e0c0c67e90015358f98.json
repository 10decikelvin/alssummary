  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong research questions that are focused and clearly define the independent and dependent variables. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is exemplary in its specificity, including the exact levels of the independent variable and a key controlled variable (time). Essay B's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is also very good, clearly outlining the variables and the method of analysis.\n\nIn terms of methodology, both essays provide detailed procedures. Essay A's procedure is exceptionally clear and easy to follow step-by-step. Essay B also provides a detailed procedure, including a separate calibration experiment, which demonstrates a thorough understanding of the technique used. Both essays have excellent tables outlining the controlled variables and how they will be managed.\n\nThe key differentiator lies in the \"Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations\" section. Essay A provides a thorough list of safety precautions (\"Gloves were worn,\" \"well-ventilated space,\" \"Safety goggles\") and, crucially, addresses the environmental impact and disposal methods for its materials (\"Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic... disposed as a hazardous waste,\" \"batteries... were recycled\"). Essay B mentions safety precautions (\"Lab coat and gloves were worn\") but completely omits any discussion of the environmental impact or disposal of the chemical waste, which is a significant weakness for an experimental investigation. While neither essay explicitly mentions \"ethical considerations,\" Essay A's more comprehensive approach to the safety and environmental aspects makes it a stronger example for Criterion B. Therefore, due to its more complete and thoughtful consideration of the experimental design as a whole, particularly regarding safety and environmental responsibilities, Essay A is judged to be superior.",
