  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior because it presents a complete and well-structured investigation, whereas Essay B is critically incomplete in several foundational areas. Both essays are experimental investigations and present strong, focused research questions; Essay A asks \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies,\" while Essay B asks \"...how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\". However, Essay A excels by providing detailed and relevant background information, which establishes the chemical principles and personal context for the investigation. In contrast, Essay B's provided text lacks any meaningful background, jumping almost directly into an incomplete procedural list.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and variables sections. Essay A provides a complete, step-by-step procedure for two distinct experimental methods, allowing for a comparative analysis as stated in its RQ. It also presents a full table of variables, and although it incorrectly identifies the independent variable as \"Mass of sample before titrating\" instead of the sample type, the attempt to identify and control variables is thorough. Essay B, on the other hand, provides an incomplete methodology, starting at step 6, and completely omits any section identifying the independent, dependent, or controlled variables, which is a major flaw. While both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns, with Essay A noting that improper disposal could \"affect soil pH, thereby disrupting the ecosystem\" and Essay B warning to \"avoid chemicals being poured down the drain,\" this parity does not compensate for Essay B's missing core components. Essay A's comprehensive approach to background, methodology, and variable analysis makes it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
