  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior depth in its experimental design, background theory, and critical self-evaluation, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused and leads to a sophisticated investigation. The background successfully links concepts of reaction rates, activation energy, the Arrhenius equation, and even pKa values to build a well-supported hypothesis. The methodology is appropriate for determining activation energy, and the identification of variables is thorough. Critically, within the variables table itself, the student shows impressive reflection, noting a potential flaw in their choice of acid concentrations (\"I used 1 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of each acid... In order to have more accuracy in the result I could have used 2 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of HCl and 1 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of H\u2082SO\u2084... the concentrations of H\u207a would have also been equal.\"). This level of foresight is commendable. The safety and environmental considerations are specific and practical, for example, \"The iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste and the propanone solution should be disposed of in the organic waste.\"\n\nEssay B's research questions are also clear and appropriate, and its methodology is a classic, well-described calorimetry experiment. The background information is relevant, and the variables are clearly identified. However, it lacks the depth of Essay A. The investigation is more standard, and the evaluation, while present, points out more generic errors like heat loss. Most significantly, Essay B completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations. For an experiment involving the combustion of multiple organic alcohols, the lack of environmental consideration (\"Formation of Soot... is an indicator of incomplete combustion\") is a serious oversight.\n\nIn direct comparison, Essay A's more complex investigation into chemical kinetics, its more detailed theoretical background, its proactive self-critique within the planning stage, and its inclusion of environmental disposal procedures make it a more thorough and higher-quality piece of work for this criterion.",
