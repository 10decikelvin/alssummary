  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior due to its exceptionally detailed and well-justified experimental design, which demonstrates a much deeper engagement with the scientific process. Its research question is a model of clarity and focus: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This level of specificity, including concentrations, variable ranges, and measurement techniques, provides a very strong foundation. In contrast, while Essay B's research question is clear, \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\", it lacks the same degree of precision.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and control of variables. Essay A's methodology is clearly informed by preliminary testing, a hallmark of excellent exploration. For example, it explains, \"the reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data in the colorimeter, so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" This shows a thoughtful, iterative approach to the design. Conversely, Essay B has a critical flaw in its experimental design by choosing not to control the mass of the tablets, stating, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This undermines the validity of the entire investigation, as any difference in neutralized acid could be due to differing tablet masses rather than the effectiveness of the active ingredients.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's documentation of variables and safety precautions is far more comprehensive. The variables are presented in a detailed table that justifies each choice, and the safety section provides a chemical-by-chemical breakdown of risks and mitigation strategies, including environmental disposal instructions like, \"Do not wash down the sink as that is an environmental hazard. Dispose according to local legislation.\" While Essay B does address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, its treatment is much more generic. Essay A's only minor weakness is the omission of an explicit \"ethical considerations\" statement, but its overall rigor, from the focused RQ to the robust methodology, makes it the clear winner.",
