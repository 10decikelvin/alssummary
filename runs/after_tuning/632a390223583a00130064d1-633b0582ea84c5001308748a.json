  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it presents a far more thorough and well-considered experimental design. Essay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is highly specific, clearly defining the independent variable's range. Its methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining a replicable procedure for both sample creation and data collection using modern tools like LabQuest 2 and Tracker software. The variable control is exemplary, with a comprehensive table for controlled variables and, notably, a section on uncontrolled variables like \"Uniform Depth of Sample,\" which showcases a high level of critical thinking about experimental limitations. Furthermore, Essay A includes an outstanding \"Risk Assessment\" table that explicitly and thoughtfully addresses safety (\"Handling of glass\"), environmental (\"Disposal of bioplastics\"), and ethical concerns (\"Use of edible materials\").\n\nWhile Essay B presents a competent plan for a data-based investigation, it falls short in several key areas. Its research questions, \"Does the number of carbon atoms... affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\" and \"...affect its boiling point?\", are less focused and sophisticated than Essay A's. Although its background information is relevant, its methodology and variable identification are less detailed. The most significant failing of Essay B is the complete omission of a dedicated section for safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. While the background discusses the environmental context of alcohols as a fuel source, it does not address the considerations of the investigation process itself, which is a requirement of the criterion. In contrast, Essay A's comprehensive approach to planning, variable control, and risk assessment makes it a much stronger example of a well-designed scientific exploration.",
