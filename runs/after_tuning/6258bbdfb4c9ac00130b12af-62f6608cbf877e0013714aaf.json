  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its superior scientific context and theoretical underpinning, which is a core component of Criterion B. While Essay A is exceptionally well-structured, Essay B demonstrates a deeper engagement with chemical principles. Essay B's background is exemplary; it not only describes the Arrhenius equation but also mathematically derives the integrated second-order rate law (`\\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t`), which forms the entire basis for its experimental design and data analysis. This direct, mathematical link between theory and method is a hallmark of a sophisticated exploration. In contrast, Essay A's background is relevant but largely descriptive, explaining what Acid Value and Saponification Value are without the same level of theoretical depth.\n\nEssay A excels in its procedural elements. Its research question is more detailed and self-contained: `Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...`. Furthermore, its identification of controlled variables in a table with \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\" columns is more thorough than Essay B's bulleted list. Essay A's risk assessment is also superior, using a detailed table that addresses multiple specific hazards such as `Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)` and the risk of flasks bursting during reflux.\n\nHowever, Essay B's foundational strength in its background section is the deciding factor. It establishes a robust scientific context that justifies not just the 'what' but the 'how' of the investigation from first principles. Its methodology, while complex, is perfectly suited to the derived equations. Although Essay A is stronger in its presentation of variables and safety, Essay B's profound integration of chemical kinetics theory into the experimental design demonstrates a higher level of scientific exploration and understanding, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
