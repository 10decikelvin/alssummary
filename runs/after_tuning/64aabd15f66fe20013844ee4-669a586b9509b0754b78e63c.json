  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong, focused, and detailed research questions suitable for an IB Chemistry IA. Essay A asks, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands in the market has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid measured in moldm-3 using acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\" and Essay B asks, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, ... 1.000mol dm^-3)...?\" Both are exemplary in their specificity. However, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and well-planned exploration overall. A key strength of Essay B is its inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section, which justifies the chosen range of concentrations and the duration of the experiment, indicating a reflective and iterative approach to experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B's control of variables is more robust; for example, it explicitly states, \"The stirring will be controlled using a magnetic stirrer, stirring at the same speed,\" while Essay A only identifies stirring as a systematic error in its limitations table.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides a comprehensive safety table detailing specific hazards, precautions like \"Use nitrile gloves, a lab coat and safety goggles,\" and emergency actions for each chemical. It also explicitly addresses environmental impact, stating, \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water,\" and ethical considerations, noting, \"This experiment has no ethical considerations, other than keeping in mind the minimisation of waste.\" In stark contrast, Essay A's safety section is dangerously minimal, claiming, \"Gloves are not necessary for this experiment due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH,\" and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental concerns. This omission is a critical flaw for an experimental investigation. While Essay A shows excellent chemical insight by identifying \"Other Acids in Orange Juice\" as a major limitation, Essay B's superior planning, proactive variable control, and comprehensive handling of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects make it the clearly better submission under Criterion B.",
