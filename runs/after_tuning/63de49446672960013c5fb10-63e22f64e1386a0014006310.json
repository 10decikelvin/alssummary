  "reasoning": "While both essays present well-structured research questions, Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality in its scientific exploration, making it the superior submission. Essay A's primary strength lies in its sophisticated background and methodology. The author provides a detailed, relevant background explaining not only the Beer-Lambert law but also advanced concepts like crystal field theory to justify the use of a copper(II) complex. Furthermore, the methodology section includes a \"Development and pilot studies\" section, where the author demonstrates excellent scientific problem-solving by addressing issues like insoluble tablet fillers and precipitate formation, stating, \"To remove these contaminants from the solution, I decided to filter it... To address this issue [precipitate], I chose to implement the concept micelles formation.\" This level of independent work and application of advanced chemical principles is a hallmark of an outstanding exploration.\n\nEssay B, while competent, investigates a more standard topic with a simpler methodology. Its research question is clear and specific, asking, \"What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...?\". The background information correctly defines key terms like homologous series and enthalpy, and the calorimetry procedure is appropriate for the question. However, the overall scientific approach lacks the depth and ingenuity of Essay A. The methodology is a standard, and notoriously inaccurate, school-level experiment, which does not showcase the same degree of personal engagement or complex problem-solving.\n\nMost critically, Essay B fails to meet key requirements for an experimental investigation. While it has a thorough safety section, it completely omits the required ethical and environmental considerations. The heading \"Safety, Environment and Ethical Considerations\" is present, but no content follows for the latter two. In contrast, Essay A explicitly, if briefly, addresses these, stating for ethics, \"To adhere by the principles of green chemistry and avoid wastage, the minimal necessary quantity of chemical substances will be used,\" and for environment, \"Chemical waste must be disposed of in the correct bin.\" This omission in Essay B is a significant flaw. Therefore, due to its superior scientific depth, demonstrated problem-solving, and complete fulfillment of all formal requirements, Essay A is decidedly better.",
