  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and detail across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is exceptionally clear, specific, and focused. This is supported by an extensive, well-researched background section that cites scientific literature and delves into complex chemistry, such as how \"phosphoserine residues in caseins enable caseins to bind with calcium,\" providing a strong justification for the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"To what extent do different types of salts... affect the volume of melted ice?\", is acceptable but less specific, and its background on freezing point depression is correct but fundamentally simpler.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B employs a standard and appropriate analytical technique (complexometric titration) with a detailed, repeatable procedure. Furthermore, its treatment of variables is exemplary, not only identifying controlled variables but also thoughtfully considering uncontrolled variables like \"Colour assessment during titration\" and \"Storage conditions of milk.\" Essay A's method is logical in principle, but contains a potential flaw in its sequential timing of trials which could compromise the control of surrounding temperature. Finally, and most critically, Essay B includes a thorough and specific risk assessment, addressing safety (\"Ammonia solution was handled with caution and only under a fume cupboard\"), environmental (\"ammonia buffer solution can be toxic to the aquatic life... diluted with extensive quantities of water before disposal\"), and ethical considerations. Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, environmental, or ethical concerns, which is a major failure for a hands-on experimental investigation.",
