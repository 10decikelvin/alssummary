  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused research question, extensive and relevant background research, and a meticulously designed methodology refined by preliminary trials. Essay B's research question, \"What is the pseudo order of reaction...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3,\" is exceptionally specific, defining the scope, method, and precise variable range. In contrast, Essay A's question is clear but standard. Furthermore, Essay B's background information on the \"Photo-Fenton Reaction\" and the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2\" shows a deep engagement with scientific literature that directly informs the experimental design, such as the choice to keep H2O2 concentrations below a specific threshold. Essay A's background on neutralization is relevant but far more fundamental.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and control of variables. Essay B's methodology was thoughtfully developed, as evidenced by its discussion of preliminary trials: \"it was observed that there was a major change between the first reading at t=0 and the second reading at t=15... Hence, aliquots were subsequently pipetted out every 4 minutes... to better model the full kinetics of the reaction.\" Conversely, Essay A contains a critical methodological flaw in its handling of variables. The student explicitly states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This decision undermines the scientific validity of comparing the neutralizing effectiveness of the active ingredients, as any difference could be due to mass rather than chemical composition. While both essays adequately address safety and environmental considerations, Essay B's overall scientific rigor, from its conception to its procedural design, is of a much higher quality.",
