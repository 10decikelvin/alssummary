  "reasoning": "Essay B provides a significantly stronger demonstration of Criterion B. Its superiority begins with the research question. Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is focused, specific, and clearly testable with one independent and one dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", introduces two independent variables (anion type and temperature), making the investigation less focused and more complex than necessary.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section is more scientifically rigorous and directly relevant. It not only defines specific heat capacity but also provides a detailed chemical explanation for the hypothesis, stating that ions are \"held in a rigid matrix of water molecules\" which reduces the energy required to activate them, thus lowering the specific heat capacity. Essay A's background defines solubility but offers a very weak justification for its hypothesis, merely stating \"\\( K N O_{3} \\) will have a higher solubility than \\( K_{2} S O_{4} \\). Since Potassium Nitrate will be smaller in size,\" which overlooks more significant factors like lattice enthalpy and the sulfate ion's charge.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is also stronger. It correctly identifies the independent variable (\"concentration of the potassium nitrate solution\") and presents controlled variables in a clear table with justification. Essay A's identification of variables is confusing; it lists \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as independent variables, which is an inaccurate representation of its own experiment. Finally, Essay B comprehensively addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, explicitly stating \"I did not use any materials from living organisms therefore there were no ethical precautions needed\" and \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\". Essay A mentions safety precautions but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical flaw for an experimental investigation.",
