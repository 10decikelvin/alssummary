  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior grasp of experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship to be investigated. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...\", is a less effective yes/no question and is overly ambitious for a school laboratory, a fact borne out by the student's own evaluation showing negligible temperature changes. Most critically, Essay B correctly identifies its variables, clearly stating the independent variable is \"Temperature of lemon juice\" and the dependent is \"Concentration of Ascorbic Acid\". Essay A, however, fundamentally misunderstands experimental variables, incorrectly stating the dependent variable is \"Different types of substances\" and the independent variable is \"Temperature change,\" which is a severe conceptual error. While Essay A provides a more detailed safety and environmental section and a very complex theoretical background, its flawed experimental design, evident in the misidentification of variables and an inappropriate methodology for the expected small energy changes, makes it the weaker submission. Essay B's strong foundation in its research question and variable identification demonstrates a much clearer and more scientifically sound plan of exploration.",
