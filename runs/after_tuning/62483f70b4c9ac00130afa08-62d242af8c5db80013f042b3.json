  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay A is superior due to its more sophisticated research question, stronger scientific context, and more relevant environmental considerations.\n\n**Research Question & Background:**\nEssay A's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is highly effective because of its evaluative nature (\"to what extent\"). This sets up a more analytical investigation than Essay B's descriptive question. The background in Essay A is exemplary; it connects the investigation to a significant global issue (climate change), explains the underlying chemistry with Le Chatelier's principle, and, most importantly, provides a critical review of three different measurement techniques, which masterfully justifies both the choice of the Winkler method and the evaluative framing of the research question. Essay B's question is also strong and specific, stating \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk... affect its calcium content (in mg) by using... EDTA complexometric titration?\". However, its background, while relevant, begins anecdotally (\"My mother insisted I keep the milk refrigerated\") and lacks the depth and critical comparison of methods seen in Essay A.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:**\nBoth essays provide clear, appropriate, and detailed methodologies. Essay B's use of tables to outline the independent, dependent, and controlled variables is exceptionally clear and thorough. For instance, in its controlled variables table, it lists \"Concentration of EDTA solution (0.05moldm\u207b\u00b3)\" and explains its importance: \"If a more diluted EDTA solution is used... it will be difficult to do the titration.\" This level of detail is a significant strength. Essay A also correctly identifies all variables, but its paragraph format is slightly less organized. However, Essay A includes a crucial detail from preliminary work: \"when collecting the sample of water from the tap, the water stream should be slow and constant as not to aerate the water,\" demonstrating personal engagement and refinement of the procedure.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:**\nBoth essays correctly identify themselves as experimental investigations and address these aspects well. Essay B provides a very detailed safety table, explaining the hazards of ammonia and the rationale for using a fume cupboard. Essay A's risk assessment is also specific, listing chemicals like \"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive\" and required precautions. Both explicitly state there are no ethical issues. However, Essay A demonstrates a stronger understanding of environmental responsibility related to the experiment itself. It provides a specific disposal instruction: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\". In contrast, Essay B's environmental point about reducing \"food wastage\" is valid in a general sense but is less focused on the chemical and environmental impact of the lab work itself.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay B is very well-structured, particularly in its handling of variables, Essay A's superior research question, more scientifically compelling background, and more pertinent environmental considerations make it the stronger piece of work.",
