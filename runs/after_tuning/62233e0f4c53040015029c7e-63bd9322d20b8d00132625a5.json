  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a more robust approach to the scientific method, particularly in its methodology and consideration of experimental limitations.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is clear but could be more specific regarding the concentrations and volumes used. The background information is relevant, but the explanation of the buffer's function could be clearer. The procedure section is detailed, but it lacks specific safety and environmental considerations, which is a significant omission for a hands-on experiment involving chemicals like sodium hydroxide.\n\nEssay B, investigating \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", presents a well-defined research question. While the provided text doesn't include the full background or methodology, the section on \"STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS\" and \"SAFETY, ETHICS AND ENVIRONMENT\" is exemplary. The student clearly identifies systemic and random errors (\"Heat loss to the surroundings,\" \"Incomplete combustion,\" \"Kitchen scale,\" \"Usage of thermometer\") and proposes specific, relevant improvements (\"Use a draught shield,\" \"use an electronic balance\"). This demonstrates a deeper understanding of experimental design and error analysis. The explicit mention of safety (\"Personal protection equipment should be worn\") and environmental concerns (\"Paraffin wax is not biodegradable, and its residue after it burns emits toxic fumes\") is comprehensive.\n\nWhile Essay A provides a complete experimental plan, Essay B's detailed consideration of error, safety, and environmental impact shows a more thorough and critical approach to the investigation. The lack of any safety or environmental discussion in Essay A is a major weakness compared to Essay B's detailed treatment of these aspects. Therefore, Essay B is the stronger submission.",
