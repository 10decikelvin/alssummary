  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong plans for their respective investigations. Essay B has a clear and focused research question: \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\". Its background information appropriately discusses reaction kinetics, catalysts, and the Arrhenius equation. The methodology is detailed, including the preparation of solutions and the experimental procedure.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior. Its research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is more specific and detailed, clearly defining the exact values of the independent variable and the time constraint. The background section not only covers the relevant electrochemical principles but also cites multiple previous studies, demonstrating thorough preliminary research. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, providing a step-by-step procedure, a full materials list with uncertainties, and a separate table analyzing potential errors. Crucially, Essay A explicitly addresses all three required considerations: safety, environmental, and ethical. While Essay B has good safety and environmental sections, it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a requirement of the criterion. Therefore, due to its more detailed research question, comprehensive methodology, and complete coverage of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay A is the stronger submission.",
