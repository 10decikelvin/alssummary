  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk...is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is exceptionally strong; it is focused, specific, and outlines the independent variable with its exact levels, the dependent variable, and the precise analytical method. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is far too broad, featuring two independent variables without specifying the salts, solvent, or temperature ranges. Furthermore, Essay A provides relevant and detailed background information on complexometric titrations and the effect of temperature on calcium phosphate solubility, creating a solid theoretical foundation. Essay B's background is superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility.\n\nThe planning and execution detailed in Essay A are far more rigorous. Essay A presents an exhaustive list of controlled variables in a clear table, providing justification for why each must be controlled, such as, \"The amount of calcium ions in the milk will be increased if the amount of sample used increases.\" Essay B's variables section is confusing, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as two separate independent variables, and its list of controlled variables is minimal and lacks justification. Most critically, Essay A excels in its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. It provides specific safety precautions, such as handling ammonia in a fume cupboard because \"Ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive,\" explicitly states that \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved,\" and even addresses environmental concerns by planning to use a minimal amount of milk to \"reduce the tendency of food wastage.\" Essay B, on the other hand, offers only a generic safety paragraph and completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for an experimental investigation.",
