  "reasoning": "Both essays have strong points, but Essay B demonstrates a more thorough understanding of the scientific process. Essay A's research question, 'What is the effect of different concentrations of iron(III) nitrate solution on the rate of reaction between iron(III) ions and iodide ions?', is well-defined. However, its experimental design lacks specifics, such as the volumes of reactants used or the method for measuring reaction time. In contrast, Essay B's research question, 'What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in lemon juice?', is also well-defined, and it is followed by a detailed methodology including a titration procedure and precise measurements. Furthermore, Essay B's inclusion of a chemical equation ('C6H8O6(aq) + I2(aq) \u2192 C6H6O6(aq) + 2H-(aq) + 2I(aq)') and an explanation of the underlying chemical principles (oxidation-reduction) showcases a deeper engagement with the scientific context. While Essay A's table of safety and environmental concerns is more structured, the prose explanation in Essay B ('The sodium hydroxide solution used is corrosive and can cause severe skin burns... the iodine solution can also cause mild skin irritation. Goggles and lab coats must be worn...') is equally sufficient and contextually relevant. Both essays provide clear results and conclusions, but the superior experimental design and background information in Essay B make it the stronger of the two.",
