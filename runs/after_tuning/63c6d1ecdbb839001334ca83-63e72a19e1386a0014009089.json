  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong research questions and detailed methodologies. Essay A's research question, 'How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...via titration...', is clear and specific about the variables and method. Similarly, Essay B's question, 'How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt...affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...', is well-defined. Both provide excellent background information relevant to their topics. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior approach to experimental design by explicitly stating a modification made after preliminary trials: 'In my trials, I noticed that when experimenting with HCl of pH range 2.0 to 4.0, the difference...was rather small...Therefore, I changed the range used to pH 2.0 to 6.0'. This shows a more developed and reflective scientific process. The most significant differentiator is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A addresses all three aspects thoroughly, noting 'wear gloves and if contact occurs, drench the area with plenty of water' for safety, 'only the required amount of chemicals were provided...limiting the amount wasted' for ethics, and specific disposal methods like 'Acidified KMnO4 should not be poured down the drain...it should be disposed into a sealable container' for environmental impact. In contrast, Essay B's 'SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES' section is weaker, presenting only a table of chemical hazards and first aid, and completely omitting any discussion of ethical considerations, which is a significant oversight. Therefore, due to its more complete and reflective approach to experimental design and safety considerations, Essay A is the stronger submission.",
