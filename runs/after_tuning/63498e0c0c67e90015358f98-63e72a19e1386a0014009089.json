  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong and well-structured investigations. Essay B is marginally superior due to its more thorough and precise approach across several key areas of Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Both research questions are excellent, clearly stating independent and dependent variables with units. Essay B's RQ, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\", is slightly more precise by including the uncertainty of the independent variable directly within the question. Essay A's RQ, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is also very strong, specifying the method of measurement.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Both essays provide relevant background information that connects to their methodology. Essay B, however, provides a more detailed explanation of the underlying chemical principles of the Winkler titration, including the balanced chemical equations (\"1. \\( 2 \\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}(\\mathrm{aq})+4 \\mathrm{OH}^{-}(\\mathrm{aq})+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightarrow 2 \\mathrm{MnO}_{2}(\\mathrm{s})+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{(1)} \\)...\"). Its procedure is also more detailed, providing the exact masses of reagents needed to prepare standard solutions (e.g., \"21.13g of MnSO\u2084\u00b7H\u2082O...dissolved in 50 cm\u00b3 of water\"), which enhances replicability. Essay A's methodology is good but slightly less detailed in the preparation phase.\n\n**Variables & Safety:** Both essays excel at identifying and justifying the control of variables, using clear tables. However, Essay B's safety section is more comprehensive. It presents a detailed table listing each chemical, its specific hazards, and corresponding first aid measures. Essay A's safety section is adequate (\"Lab coat and gloves were worn\") but less systematic.\n\n**Ethical & Environmental Considerations:** A significant weakness in both essays is the complete omission of any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. As both are experimental labs dealing with chemical disposal, this is a notable oversight. However, since both essays share this same flaw, it does not serve as a differentiator between them.\n\nOverall, while both are high-quality, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of precision and thoroughness in its research question, methodology, and safety protocols, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
