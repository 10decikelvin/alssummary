  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger scientific foundation in its exploration design, making it the superior essay despite its omissions in safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is focused, detailed, and establishes a clear relationship between variables using a specific analytical technique. This is supported by a scientifically rich background that explains the \"diverse ion effect\" and \"charge density\" as the underlying chemical principles. In contrast, Essay A's research question is a less sophisticated comparison, and its methodology contains a critical flaw in variable identification, incorrectly stating the \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable instead of the type of sample. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is well-planned, including a crucial calibration experiment (\"determine the wavelength at which absorbance was maximum\") and robust variable controls, such as maintaining temperature at a specific \"40\u00b0C\" using a magnetic stirrer. Essay A's methodology is weaker, with vague temperature control (\"the same Bunsen Burner was used\") and a problematic step where one sample \"took a day to completely dissolve,\" which undermines the comparability of the methods. While Essay A is commendable for its more thorough safety section and explicit environmental consideration regarding disposal (\"dumping them outside may affect soil pH\"), these strengths cannot compensate for the fundamental weaknesses in its experimental design. Essay B's superior research question, scientific background, methodology, and correct identification of variables firmly establish it as the better example of IB-level scientific exploration.",
