  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comparative evaluation of both essays against the core components of Criterion B. Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific engagement, complexity, and methodological rigor.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research question and background, Essay B is superior. While Essay A presents a clear and specific research question (\"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid... using acid-base titration...\"), Essay B's investigation is grounded in a more sophisticated context. Essay B justifies its research by identifying a specific gap in existing literature, stating, \"these researches were based on experiments conducted using model foods... Thus, I decided to research how different oils with varying saturation levels affected the Maillard reaction using real food.\" This demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking and engagement with the scientific process. Furthermore, Essay B's background provides a more in-depth explanation of complex concepts, linking the Maillard reaction to Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) and the principles of colorimetry via the Lambert-Beer Law.\n\nSecond, in terms of methodology and variables, Essay B is far stronger. Essay A's methodology suffers from a critical flaw: using NaOH titrates all acids in the juice (citric, malic, etc.), not just ascorbic acid. The student correctly identifies this limitation, noting \"Other Acids in Orange Juice... might have reacted with the NaOH,\" but this awareness does not fix the fundamental weakness in the experimental design itself. In contrast, Essay B's methodology is ambitious, well-structured, and appropriate for its complex research question. Essay B's control of variables is also exceptionally thorough, presented in a detailed table that explains not only the method of control but also the \"Possible Effects on Results,\" a level of detail not present in Essay A.\n\nFinally, regarding safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, both essays are weak. Both completely omit any mention of ethical or environmental factors. Essay A's safety section is minimal, dismissively stating, \"Gloves are not necessary... No other special safety precautions are required.\" Essay B's safety assessment is also brief but is more specific to the actual risks involved: \"Oven (High Temperatures): Heat-proof gloves were worn... Glassware (Fragile): Beakers and Volumetric Flasks were handled with high caution.\" While flawed, Essay B's approach is slightly more considered.\n\nIn conclusion, despite shared weaknesses in the safety, ethical, and environmental sections, Essay B is decisively better. Its superior background research, methodologically sound and sophisticated experimental design, and more thorough control of variables clearly outweigh the flawed core methodology presented in Essay A.",
