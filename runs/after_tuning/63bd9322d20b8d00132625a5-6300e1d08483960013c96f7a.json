  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear, focused, and testable research questions. Essay B, however, provides a stronger foundational understanding in its background section, explaining the concept of freezing point depression and linking it directly to the number of ions in the salt compounds, thus creating a solid theoretical basis for its hypothesis. Essay A's background information is not provided in the snippet. While both labs outline their independent, dependent, and controlled variables correctly, Essay A's methodology is incomplete, jumping from step 2 to step 7. In contrast, Essay B provides a full, replicable method. Regarding safety and ethical considerations, Essay A's section is more thorough, explicitly mentioning the use of PPE, proper ventilation, and the environmental impact of paraffin. Essay B only briefly mentions 'Safety, ethics, and environment' without providing any details. Despite this, the strength of Essay B's scientific grounding and complete methodology makes it the superior piece. It demonstrates a deeper understanding of the scientific principles being investigated and provides a clearer roadmap for the experiment.",
