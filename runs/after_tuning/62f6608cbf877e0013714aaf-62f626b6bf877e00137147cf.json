  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific exploration across nearly all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, clear, and supported by an excellent theoretical background. The background section thoroughly explains the Arrhenius equation and derives the second-order rate law (`\\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t`), directly justifying the proposed methodology. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is less focused as 'expiration date' is a vague variable. Furthermore, its introduction is critically weak, offering only a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution,\" without any relevant chemical theory.\n\nSecond, the methodology and variable control in Essay A are far superior. It clearly outlines the independent variable with a specific range (\"Four different temperature intervals were chosen at differences of 10 K: 303 K, 313 K, 323 K, 333 K\"), the dependent variable, and a comprehensive list of well-justified control variables. Essay B fails to explicitly list its variables, and its procedure is incomplete, describing a single titration but not how the independent variable (expiration date) would be investigated.\n\nFinally, while Essay B has a reasonably detailed safety assessment, it omits ethical considerations entirely. Essay A addresses all three required areas, stating for safety: \"Ethyl acetate is flammable... sodium hydroxide is corrosive,\" for ethics: \"There were no notable ethical or environmental issues,\" and for environment: \"ethyl acetate was flushed down the sink with large quantities of water.\" This comprehensive approach, combined with its profound strength in research question, background, and methodology, makes Essay A a much higher quality submission.",
