  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior due to its significantly more robust and well-defined experimental design. The research question in Essay A is highly specific, stating, 'How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited...?,' which clearly outlines the scope and range of the independent variable. In contrast, Essay B's question, 'How has concentration affected enthalpy change...?' is vaguer, and the methodology only specifies two concentrations (0.5M and 1.0M), which is insufficient for establishing a clear relationship. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is more detailed, providing a clear list of controlled variables and how they will be maintained, such as keeping the 'temperature of the solution... constant at 22.3 \u00b10.1 \u00b0C'. While both essays have good background sections, Essay A's is more directly linked to the quantitative aspects of its experiment through the inclusion of Faraday's Laws. Finally, Essay A's handling of safety and environmental considerations is more thorough, noting that 'Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic to aquatic organisms and hazardous to aquatic environment. Hence, it was disposed as a hazardous waste.' Essay B's discussion of these aspects is more generic. Although Essay A omits an explicit mention of ethical considerations, its overall scientific rigor and clarity make it the stronger piece of work.",
