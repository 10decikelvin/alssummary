  "reasoning": "Essay B is stronger as it demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach across all aspects of the exploration. While Essay A presents a solid investigation, Essay B excels in the specificity of its research question, the depth of its background research, and the detail of its procedural planning and risk assessment.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is significantly more focused and detailed than Essay A's, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\". Essay B precisely lists the concentrations of the independent variable, immediately clarifying the scope of the investigation.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay B is more comprehensive and directly linked to the methodology. It not only explains the underlying chemical principles like the Beer-Lambert law and collision theory but also demonstrates proactive problem-solving by detailing the preliminary titration needed to determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach. This shows a higher level of engagement than Essay A's more general background on BOD and the Winkler method.\n\nThird, the methodology in Essay B is more robust, notably including a \"Pre-Test\" section to determine the spectrophotometer's optimal wavelength and the bleach's initial concentration. This foresight in planning is superior to Essay A's methodology, which is adequate but lacks this preliminary validation. Furthermore, Essay B's table of controlled variables provides a clearer justification for *why* each variable is significant and must be controlled (e.g., \"Since the dependent variable of this experiment is the reaction rate, temperature must remain constant...\").\n\nFinally, Essay B's handling of safety and environmental considerations is far more specific. While both essays are experimental and address safety, Essay B's environmental statement (\"the chemicals potassium iodide and sodium thiosulfate (0.1M)... were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor\") is vastly superior to Essay A's vague mention of disposal \"in basin of school laboratory,\" demonstrating a more responsible and informed approach. Both essays fail to explicitly address ethical considerations, but this is a minor omission compared to the other areas where Essay B clearly excels.",
