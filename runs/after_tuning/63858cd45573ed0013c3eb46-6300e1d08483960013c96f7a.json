  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B, primarily due to its meticulous experimental design, thorough consideration of variables, and comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, which are entirely absent in Essay B.\n\nBoth essays present clear and focused research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", while Essay B asks, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\". Both also provide relevant background information. However, Essay A's methodology and variable control are far more rigorous. For instance, Essay A details specific and thoughtful controls, such as for the catalyst's surface area: \"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" In contrast, Essay B's methodology is flawed; the procedure implies sequential trials for each salt, which fails to properly control the \"Surrounding temperature and pressure\" variable over the duration of the experiment.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides a detailed risk assessment for each chemical, noting that \"Manganese dioxide... is harmful by inhalation or if swallowed\" and justifying the use of \"3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution\" to reduce risk. It also explicitly addresses environmental concerns, stating that waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\". Essay B, despite being an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental factors. This is a critical failure for Criterion B, as it demonstrates a lack of awareness of fundamental laboratory practices.\n\nWhile Essay B has a solid research question and background, its weak methodology and total lack of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations make it significantly weaker. Essay A presents a well-planned, controlled, and responsibly considered investigation from start to finish.",
