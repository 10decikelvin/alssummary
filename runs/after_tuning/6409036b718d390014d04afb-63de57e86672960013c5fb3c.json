  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of quality for Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally superior due to its exceptional demonstration of the experimental design process.\n\nFirst, both essays feature clear, focused, and highly specific research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ)... measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", while Essay B asks, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". Both specify the exact independent variable values and how the dependent variable will be measured, setting a strong foundation.\n\nThe background research in both is relevant and detailed. Essay A provides excellent theoretical context, linking the BZ reaction to reaction kinetics, collision theory, and autocatalysis. Essay B effectively grounds its research in a personal context (jewellery making) and connects its hypothesis to Faraday's law of electrolysis. Both are strong, but Essay A's theoretical depth is slightly more comprehensive.\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the methodology section. Essay B presents a clear, replicable, and well-controlled procedure. However, Essay A's \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section is exemplary because it showcases the iterative process of scientific exploration. The student details the limitations of initial approaches, stating, \"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results...Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter...it only did so at an instant and did not log continuous data...Ultimately...the built-in lux sensor in the data logger could determine the changes\". This narrative of trial, error, and refinement demonstrates a much deeper level of personal engagement and critical thinking in the design phase than a simple, polished procedure.\n\nFinally, both essays handle safety, environmental, and ethical considerations well. Essay B is slightly more formal by explicitly stating, \"There are no ethical issues to be considered\". However, Essay A demonstrates a more proactive environmental consideration by stating, \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" While both are excellent, Essay A's profound reflection on the methodological development makes it the stronger example of scientific exploration.",
