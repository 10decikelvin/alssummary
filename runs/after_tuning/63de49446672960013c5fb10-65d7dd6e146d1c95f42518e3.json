  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a research question regarding the effect of temperature on vitamin C content. Both investigations mention the same method: titration of vitamin C with DCPIP. The difference between the papers is that Student B's methodology is clearer and has more scientific language, for example, it mentions the use of 'standardised' iodine. While Student A does give some reasoning for the chosen methodology and temperatures, Student B's explanation about why a pH buffer is used and how starch is used as an indicator is better.  Additionally, Student B mentions personal safety considerations, whereas student A does not. Neither of the texts mention environmental considerations but as they are not producing any toxic or large quantities of chemical waste this is not crucial. In summary, Student A has a good experiment but lacks detail, while Student B is more thorough.",
