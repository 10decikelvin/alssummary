  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay A demonstrates a slightly higher level of scientific exploration. Essay A's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This specificity in concentrations, temperatures, and measurement technique sets a very clear and ambitious scope. While Essay B's question is also good (\"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices...and their vitamin C...concentration measured by redox titration?\"), Essay A's is more precise.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background is more theoretically rigorous, discussing the reaction mechanism, rate laws, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly integral to the investigation's goal of finding the activation energy. The methodology in Essay A is also strengthened by a dedicated \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies key procedural decisions, such as the choice of heating method and the maximum temperature. This demonstrates a more mature and iterative experimental design process.\n\nEssay B's main strength over Essay A lies in its explicit and thoughtful consideration of all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. It specifically addresses ethical concerns (\"the least possible amount of fruits was used...to minimize the waste\") and environmental impact (\"the heating plate...was powered off...when it was not used\"), areas where Essay A is less complete (omitting ethics entirely). However, Essay A's safety section is more detailed, breaking down risks by specific chemical.\n\nUltimately, Essay A is superior because the core scientific planning\u2014the research question, the depth of the supporting theory, and the method development demonstrated through preliminary trials\u2014is more sophisticated and thorough.
