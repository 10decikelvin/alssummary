  "reasoning": "Both essays describe valid experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher quality of exploration across nearly all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is significantly more detailed and focused. It explicitly states the ranges for both independent variables and the specific measurement technique: \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\". In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy.\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity regarding the variable range in the question itself.\n\nSecond, Essay B's background research and rationale are more comprehensive. It not only provides the relevant chemical principles but also justifies the choice of methodology by considering and dismissing alternatives (\"the current determination method and fluorescence quenching method is widely used...it wouldn't be a good fit for the scope of this experiment\"). Essay A's background on kinetics is relevant and correct, but Essay B's inclusion of a strong real-world context (global warming's effect on marine life) and supporting literature graphs demonstrates deeper engagement.\n\nThird, while both essays identify variables correctly, Essay B's treatment of controlled variables is far more thorough. It provides an extensive list with specific reasons for control and detailed methods, such as controlling \"Exposure to atmospheric oxygen/air\" by ensuring \"the tip of the pipette is below the surface level of the water when retrieving solution.\" Essay A identifies appropriate controlled variables but with less detailed justification.\n\nFinally, Essay B's safety and environmental protocols are more specific. It lists disposal methods for individual chemicals (e.g., sulfuric acid: \"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink\") and mentions specific personal protective equipment (\"lab gloves, masks, lab coats and goggles\"). Essay A's safety measures are more generic, stating, \"Very careful operations during the experiment and following the safety rules of the laboratory at all times.\" While Essay A is a competent investigation, Essay B consistently shows greater depth, specificity, and scientific rigor in its design and planning.",
