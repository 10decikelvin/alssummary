  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay A is superior due to its more thorough scientific background and more rigorous identification and justification of variables.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying ranges for two independent variables and the measurement technique. Its background section is excellent, providing a clear rationale linked to global warming and justifying the choice of Winkler's titration over alternatives. Most impressively, the hypothesis is substantiated with detailed chemical principles, explaining how salinity affects \"dipole \u2013 induced dipole intermolecular bond[s]\" and how temperature relates to the \"kinetic energy\" of molecules.\n\nEssay B also has a well-formulated research question: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk...is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using...EDTA complexometric titration?\". The background is relevant and the methodology is appropriate. However, its scientific explanation lacks the depth of Essay A's. The crucial area where Essay A excels is its treatment of controlled variables. Essay A's table clearly separates \"Why was it controlled?\" from \"How was it controlled?\" for seven distinct variables, providing specific scientific reasoning for each (e.g., controlling atmospheric pressure because \"Dissolved oxygen increases with an increase in atmospheric pressure\"). Essay B's controlled variables table is less detailed, combining the 'why' and 'how' and offering more generic justifications like ensuring \"the accuracy of the result.\" Both essays handle safety, ethical, and environmental considerations well, with Essay A providing a chemical-by-chemical disposal plan and Essay B commendably addressing food waste.\n\nUltimately, Essay A demonstrates a deeper understanding of experimental design through its meticulous variable control and provides a more robust scientific context for its investigation, making it the stronger of the two.",
