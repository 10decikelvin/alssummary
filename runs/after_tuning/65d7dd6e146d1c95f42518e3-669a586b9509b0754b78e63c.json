  "reasoning": "Both essays have strong points. Essay A presents a well-defined research question: 'How do varying concentrations of salt water... affect the rate of seed germination...?' It also provides a detailed, replicable methodology. However, its discussion of ethical considerations is completely absent, which is a significant omission. Essay B, on the other hand, provides a more thorough background, citing sources and explaining the chemical reactions involved. Its research question, 'how does a changing pH level affect the rate of reaction of antacid tablets?' is specific and focused. The methodology is also detailed and reproducible. Crucially, Essay B includes a dedicated 'Risk Assessment' section that addresses safety, ethical, and environmental aspects in detail, such as 'Handling of Corrosive Chemicals (HCl)'. While Essay A is good, the more comprehensive approach to safety, ethics, and background information makes Essay B the stronger submission for this internal assessment.",
