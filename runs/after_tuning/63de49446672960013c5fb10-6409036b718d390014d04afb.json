  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality Criterion B sections, demonstrating significant thought in their experimental design. However, Essay B is superior due to its more detailed and precise research question, its exceptional justification for the chosen methodology, and its more thorough consideration of safety and environmental factors.\n\nFirst, while both research questions are focused, Essay B's is more detailed and self-contained. Essay B asks: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question immediately specifies the independent variable's range and the precise metrics for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6...\", is clear but requires the reader to look at the variables section to understand the specific temperatures being investigated.\n\nSecond, both essays excel in detailing the development of their methodology, but Essay B's account is more compelling. Essay B provides a clear narrative of troubleshooting its measurement technique, moving from visual observation to a colorimeter and finally to a lux sensor, explaining the rationale at each stage: \"While the colourimeter was able to measure the colours... it only did so at an instant and did not log continuous data over time... the built-in lux sensor in the data logger could determine the changes in colour\". Essay A also shows excellent problem-solving by using filtration and micelles to deal with impurities and precipitation, but Essay B's step-by-step refinement of the core data collection method demonstrates a slightly deeper level of methodological development.\n\nFinally, Essay B's treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations is more robust. It lists specific hazards for each primary chemical, such as for Potassium Bromate: \"may cause fire or explosion, is a strong oxidizer, toxic if swallowed, and may cause cancer\". Furthermore, its environmental consideration is directly linked to an action taken to improve the experiment: \"...the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" While Essay A correctly identifies hazards and disposal methods, its statements are slightly more general, and its environmental point is less developed.\n\nIn summary, Essay A is a very strong submission with a well-developed method. However, Essay B's superior precision in the research question, more detailed methodological development, and more specific and applied safety and environmental considerations make it the better of the two.",
