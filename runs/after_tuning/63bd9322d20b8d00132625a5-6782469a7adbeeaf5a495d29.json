  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all key criteria for a scientific investigation. \n\n**Research Question:** Essay B presents a highly specific and focused research question: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2 in the degradation of Methyl Orange, in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light, through the use of Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometry (UV-Vis), for concentrations of H2O2 between 1.77 mmol dm-3 and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This clearly defines the scope, variables, and methodology. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", is less precise and lacks defined parameters.\n\n**Methodology & Control of Variables:** Essay B provides a detailed, step-by-step procedure for solution preparation and the experiment itself. It also features a comprehensive table of controlled variables with justifications for why they must be kept constant. Essay A's procedure is a simple list of steps lacking crucial details like quantities and specific controls, making reproducibility difficult.\n\n**Context & Rationale:** Essay B offers a strong introduction and background, citing scientific literature and establishing a clear real-world context for the investigation (water pollution). This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the scientific problem. Essay A's context is not provided in the excerpt.\n\n**Analysis & Evaluation:** Essay B includes a dedicated section for analyzing the results, interpreting the data in the context of reaction kinetics, and providing a thoughtful evaluation of limitations and potential improvements. While Essay A also has a \"Strengths and Limitations\" section, it is less detailed and the analysis appears to be less sophisticated.\n\n**Safety & Environmental Considerations:** Essay B explicitly addresses safety precautions and environmental impact, mentioning specific PPE and disposal methods. Essay A's safety section is more generic. \n\nOverall, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough, well-planned, and scientifically rigorous approach to the investigation.",
