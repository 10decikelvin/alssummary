  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\", is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, specifying concentrations, the range of the independent variable, and the exact method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...\", is a less sophisticated yes/no question. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is robust, clearly linked to the background theory (Arrhenius equation, Beer-Lambert law), and refined through preliminary testing. Essay A's methodology proved unworkable, as its own evaluation section states \"the temperature differences are too small to be considered,\" indicating a critical design flaw. A major weakness in Essay A is the incorrect identification of variables, stating temperature change is the independent variable and the substances used are dependent, which is fundamentally incorrect. Essay B, however, correctly identifies and provides extensive detail on controlling its independent, dependent, and numerous controlled variables. Finally, Essay B's safety, environmental, and ethical considerations are exemplary, presenting a detailed table with specific chemical hazards, mitigation strategies, and disposal instructions, whereas Essay A's are much more generic.",
