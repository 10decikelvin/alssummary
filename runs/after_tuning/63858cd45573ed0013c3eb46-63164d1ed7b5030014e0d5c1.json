  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly more thorough and sophisticated approach to Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core components, Essay B begins with a slightly stronger research question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\". The phrase \"To what extent\" is more evaluative than Essay A's \"How does... impact...\". However, Essay A compensates with a more detailed and focused background section. It provides a deeper theoretical context by explaining heterogeneous catalysis and the role of active sites, stating, \"heterogenous catalysis is characterized by the adsorption of reactant molecules to these active sites, meaning their availability can greatly limit the rate of heterogeneous reactions.\" This directly justifies why changing the mass of the catalyst (the independent variable) is a meaningful investigation. Essay B's background is relevant but more descriptive of the technique rather than the chemical degradation process.\n\nSecond, regarding the methodology and variables, both are appropriate. Essay A shows strong personal engagement by modifying the typical definition of rate, explaining, \"I then graphed my results and used the derivatives of the lines of best fit to create another graph of the rate vs. mass of catalyst... instead of [\u0394conc]/[\u0394t]\". Both essays identify and justify their variables well. Essay A's attempt to control for the surface area of the catalyst, \"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure,\" although difficult to perfect, shows a high level of awareness of confounding variables.\n\nFinally, the consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects is a key differentiator. Both essays handle safety well, identifying specific chemical hazards. Essay A, however, provides a much stronger environmental consideration. It states, \"the experiment was designed with waste prevention in mind... Manganese dioxide catalyst remaining... were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\". In contrast, Essay B is dismissive, simply stating, \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is a weaker handling of this requirement for an experimental investigation. This thoroughness in Essay A, combined with its stronger theoretical background, makes it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
