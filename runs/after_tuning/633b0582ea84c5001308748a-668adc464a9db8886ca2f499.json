  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across most elements of Criterion B. The primary differentiator is the quality of the research question. Essay B's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally focused and detailed. It specifies the exact concentrations of the independent variable and the precise method of measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology and background are more thoroughly integrated and detailed. The background information provides a deep dive into the specific chemical principles needed for the experiment, including the Beer-Lambert law, the chemistry of chromophores, and the redox titration required to determine the initial bleach concentration. This directly justifies the comprehensive experimental methodology that follows. Essay A has a relevant background, but it is more general. While Essay A's methodology is appropriate for a data-based investigation, clearly stating its sources (\"ChemPub and Chemeo\"), Essay B's experimental plan, including a preliminary test to find the bleach concentration, shows a higher level of scientific engagement.\n\nFinally, as an experimental investigation, Essay B correctly and thoroughly addresses safety and environmental concerns. It includes a detailed \"Safety Data Sheet\" table for all chemicals and explicitly states how hazardous waste was handled: \"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay A, being a data-based study, appropriately omits these sections. However, Essay B's successful execution of these required components further elevates its quality, making it the superior example of Criterion B.",
