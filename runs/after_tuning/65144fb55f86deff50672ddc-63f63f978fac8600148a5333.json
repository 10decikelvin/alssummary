  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality Criterion B sections with strong research questions and detailed methodologies. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of planning and experimental control.\n\nEssay A's research question is highly specific: \"How does an increase in ionic radii...of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol)...calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". Its background is relevant, and its safety, ethical, and environmental sections are appropriate for an experimental investigation, noting specific chemical hazards like \"Ammonium hydroxide, when inhaled, can irritate lungs\" and disposal methods like \"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\". A significant weakness, however, arises from its core assumptions. The methodology assumes all metal ions will undergo a simple ligand exchange and form octahedral complexes, which the student later identifies as a major systematic error for copper, iron, and manganese, undermining the validity of a large portion of the data.\n\nEssay B's research question is equally strong and specific: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". Its key strength lies in its proactive and meticulous experimental design. The background thoughtfully justifies the chosen pH range to avoid a known confounding variable, stating \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4... Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" Furthermore, its table of controlled variables is exceptionally thorough, including nuanced factors like \"Brand of Oranges used,\" \"Pre-treatment of Orange Peels,\" and \"Shaking speed (400 rpm),\" demonstrating a much deeper consideration of potential sources of error than Essay A.\n\nIn conclusion, while both essays meet the basic requirements of Criterion B well, Essay B is superior. Its experimental design is more robust and demonstrates a higher level of foresight by anticipating and controlling for numerous potential confounding variables, whereas Essay A's design contains fundamental flaws that compromise the validity of its results.",
