  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger than Essay B across several key aspects of Criterion B. The primary differentiator lies in the depth of the background information and the thoroughness of the safety, environmental, and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is more detailed and specific within its own phrasing: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration...measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This level of detail, specifying both the exact values of the independent variable and the metrics for the dependent variable, is superior to Essay B's question, which, while clear, requires the reader to look elsewhere for the concentration range. Furthermore, Essay A's background section provides a robust theoretical foundation, linking the investigation to collision theory with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution graph. It also includes an excellent \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which justifies the use of a lux sensor over alternatives, demonstrating authentic personal engagement and preliminary investigation.\n\nSecond, while both essays have appropriate methodologies, Essay A excels in its risk assessment. Essay A provides specific hazards for each chemical used, such as \"Potassium bromate...toxic if swallowed, and may cause cancer,\" and details specific mitigation like using a fume cupboard. In contrast, Essay B's safety section is generic, stating chemicals \"could cause skin and nasal irritations\" without specific details.\n\nMost critically, Essay A includes an outstanding environmental consideration section. It not only mentions proper disposal (\"solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\") but also demonstrates proactive environmental thought by explaining how the procedure was scaled down \"by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" Essay B completely omits any mention of environmental impact or disposal, which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation generating chemical waste. While Essay B's methodology, including a proper calibration curve, is sound, it does not compensate for the lack of depth in its background and the critical omission of environmental considerations, making Essay A the better submission.",
