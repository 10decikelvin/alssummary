  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for the Exploration criterion. They both present focused and well-defined research questions, provide relevant background information, and detail a logical, safe, and ethical methodology. However, Essay B is marginally stronger due to its more thorough and reflective approach to the experimental design.\n\nEssay A has a clear research question: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\". It provides good background, a detailed procedure, and a comprehensive table of controlled variables. The safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are also well-documented.\n\nEssay B, however, excels in the finer details. Its research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is exceptionally clear and focused. The background information not only explains the chemistry but also justifies the choice of titrant concentration with a preliminary calculation. Crucially, the methodology section in Essay B mentions a modification based on preliminary results: \"...when experimenting with HCl of pH range 2.0 to 4.0, the difference between the volume of KMnO\u2084 used was rather small thus, resulting in inconclusive results. Therefore, I changed the range used to pH 2.0 to 6.0...\". This demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and iterative design. Furthermore, Essay B's evaluation of potential errors is more sophisticated, distinguishing between random and systematic errors and suggesting specific, practical improvements like using a colorimeter. While Essay A is very competent, Essay B's deeper justification, reflection, and refinement of its methodology make it the superior example of scientific exploration.",
