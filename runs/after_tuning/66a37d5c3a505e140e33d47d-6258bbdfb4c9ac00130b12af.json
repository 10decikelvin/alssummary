  "reasoning": "Both essays represent strong experimental investigations and meet the core requirements for Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of complexity, depth, and thoroughness in its experimental design and justification.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is slightly more ambitious by tackling two dependent variables. Its methodology is significantly more advanced, involving standardization of solutions, reflux apparatus, and two separate, complex titration procedures. This is further supported by the inclusion of a \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains choices like chemical concentrations and heating methods, and a \"Preliminary Experiment\" section, which shows excellent planning. In contrast, Essay A's RQ, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices...and their vitamin C...concentration measured by redox titration?\", is also well-formed, but the corresponding methodology is a more standard and straightforward titration.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify and control variables, Essay B's control measures show a more nuanced understanding of potential confounding factors, citing \"Microbial Contamination\" and \"Light\" as variables to be controlled. Furthermore, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are more robust. Its safety section is a detailed risk assessment table that addresses multiple specific chemical hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"Hazardous liquids (HCl, KOH & ethanoic KOH)\". Its environmental consideration correctly focuses on the proper disposal of chemical waste, stating \"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\" Essay A's considerations are adequate but less specific; for instance, its environmental point is about energy consumption (\"it was powered off and unplugged when it was not used\"), which is less critical than chemical disposal in this context.\n\nUltimately, while Essay A is a very competent and well-executed investigation, Essay B's superior methodological complexity, detailed planning evidence, and more thorough risk assessment make it the better example of Criterion B.",
