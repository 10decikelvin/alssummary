  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it demonstrates a more cohesive and well-considered approach to the experimental design, particularly regarding its research question and risk assessment. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is well-formulated, using evaluative language (\"To what extent\") that frames a focused investigation. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is less specific about the range of the independent variable and awkwardly phrased. While Essay B provides a strong theoretical background, including a correct calculation of Gibbs free energy to establish feasibility (\"$\\Delta G_{\\text {cell }}^{\\theta}=-212300 k J$\"), its execution of the safety and environmental considerations is critically flawed. Essay B presents a direct contradiction, stating \"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways as they are hazardous and toxic\" while its procedure states, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain,\" which is an incorrect and environmentally irresponsible disposal method. Essay A, however, provides specific and relevant safety precautions such as \"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware, and check for cracks before heating on a hot plate\" and explicitly addresses all three areas of risk assessment without contradictions. Therefore, Essay A's solid foundational elements (RQ, variables, methodology) combined with its accurate and specific risk assessment make it a better example of Criterion B.",
