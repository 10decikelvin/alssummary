  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B across all evaluated elements of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its highly focused and detailed research question: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This question precisely defines the independent variable's range, the dependent variable, the biosorbent, and the analytical technique. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks specificity regarding the temperature range or measurement method.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background information is directly relevant and provides a strong chemical justification for the experimental design, explaining why the pH range was limited to below 5.4 to avoid the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082. The methodology is complete, logical, and includes thoughtful steps like using a centrifuge to remove particulates. Essay B's methodology is critically incomplete, as it is missing the entire procedure, apparatus list, and chemical list.\n\nEssay A also excels in its identification and control of variables, offering detailed chemical reasoning for each control, such as how temperature affects pectin breakdown. Finally, as an experimental investigation, Essay A correctly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific details, noting that \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\". Essay B, also an experimental investigation, entirely omits this mandatory section, which is a major flaw. The combination of a superior research question, a complete and justified methodology, and the inclusion of all required safety and environmental protocols makes Essay A the clear winner.",
