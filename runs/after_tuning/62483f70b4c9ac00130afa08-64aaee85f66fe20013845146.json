  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger foundation in its research question and background, which are critical components of Criterion B. The research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is highly focused, specific, and contains evaluative language (\"To what extent...a good way\") that sets up a sophisticated investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question is a statement of intent: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\". While focused, it lacks the analytical depth of Essay A's question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background section is exemplary. It connects the investigation to a real-world context (\"Paris Agreement,\" \"fish kill\"), explains the underlying chemistry with Le Chatelier's Principle, and critically evaluates alternative measurement techniques before justifying the choice of the Winkler method. This demonstrates a comprehensive and well-integrated understanding. Essay B's background is adequate but less developed, presenting a series of definitions on Dichloromethane and Caffeine without weaving them into a compelling scientific narrative that fully justifies the experimental design.\n\nBoth essays have appropriate methodologies and correctly identify their variables. However, Essay A includes a section on learnings from \"preliminary trials,\" which shows a higher level of personal engagement and methodological refinement. The most significant difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring these sections. Essay A provides specific safety precautions for named chemicals (\"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive, wear goggles\"), explicitly addresses ethics (\"There are no major ethical issues\"), and provides a clear environmental disposal instruction (\"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting\"). Essay B has a decent safety section but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw, especially when using a hazardous organic solvent like dichloromethane.\n\nOverall, Essay A is superior due to its sophisticated research question, in-depth background research, and its complete and specific handling of all required safety, ethical, and environmental aspects.",
