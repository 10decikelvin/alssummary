  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more rigorous and detailed approach to experimental design, particularly in its research question and handling of variables. Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This level of specificity, including concentrations, the exact temperature range, and measurement technique, is a hallmark of excellent experimental planning. In contrast, while Essay A's question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is good, it lacks the same degree of quantitative precision.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's presentation of variables in a detailed table, explaining *why* and *how* each is controlled, is exemplary. For instance, for the concentration of reactants, it states, \"By keeping the volume and concentration constant throughout the experiment, it ensures the same number of moles are used,\" which is a clear justification. Essay A correctly identifies its variables but does not provide this level of detailed reasoning for their control. Essay B also provides a more thorough safety and environmental risk assessment, detailing specific hazards and disposal methods for each chemical used, such as for Sulfuric acid: \"Dispose according to local legislation. Neutralise with lime or soda ash.\" While Essay A does address safety and environmental concerns, stating for its waste to be diluted \"in a minimum ratio of 1:2\", Essay B's approach is more comprehensive. Both essays provide relevant background information, but Essay B's direct connection of theory (Arrhenius equation, Beer-Lambert law) to its methodology showcases a slightly deeper integration of concepts into the experimental design.",
