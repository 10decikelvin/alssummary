  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality, experimental investigations with strong personal engagement. Essay B's research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created,\" is exceptionally clear and focused, specifying both the variables and the precise measurement technique. Essay A's question is also good but slightly less focused as it investigates two independent variables (protein and fat) simultaneously. Both essays provide excellent, relevant background information; Essay A demonstrates a deep understanding of coordination chemistry in milk (\"The phosphoserine residues in caseins enable caseins to bind with calcium, forming calcium-phosphate bonding in casein micelles\"), while Essay B provides a superb justification for its chosen wavelength in colorimetry (\"brown... corresponds with a violet-blue as its complementary colour... this violet-blue corresponds with 420 nm\").\n\nMethodologically, both are strong and appropriate. Essay A uses a standard complexometric titration, while Essay B's method of baking, extraction, and colorimetry is ambitious and well-planned. Both identify and control variables effectively in detailed tables. Essay A has a slight edge here by also identifying and discussing uncontrolled variables, such as \"Storage conditions of milk,\" which demonstrates a higher level of reflective thinking on the experimental design.\n\nThe definitive difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides a complete and thorough risk assessment. It addresses safety (\"Ammonia solution was handled with caution and only under a fume cupboard\"), ethical considerations (\"No ethical concerns were identified\"), and environmental impact (\"The ammonia buffer solution can be toxic to the aquatic life. Therefore, they were diluted with extensive quantities of water before disposal...\"). In contrast, Essay B addresses safety (\"Oven (High Temperatures): Heat-proof gloves were worn\") but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. For an experimental investigation, this is a critical flaw. Because Essay A fully and competently addresses all required components of Criterion B, it is the superior submission.",
