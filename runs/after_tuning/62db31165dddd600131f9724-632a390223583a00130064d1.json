  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger across all elements of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is highly specific and focused, clearly defining the range of the independent variable. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail. Essay B also provides a much more thorough methodology and identification of variables; it includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables with justifications (\"Table 2 - Controlled Variables\") and even considers uncontrolled variables, demonstrating a sophisticated experimental design. Essay A, however, presents an entirely empty variables table, which is a critical omission. Furthermore, Essay B conducts a thoughtful and explicit risk assessment, covering safety (\"Handling of glass\"), environmental (\"Disposal of bioplastics...should be compostable\"), and ethical considerations (\"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted\"). Essay A completely lacks any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental factors, which is a major flaw for a lab-based investigation. While Essay A's background on ascorbic acid oxidation is relevant, Essay B's comprehensive background, detailed methodology, and meticulous attention to variables and safety make it demonstrably superior.",
