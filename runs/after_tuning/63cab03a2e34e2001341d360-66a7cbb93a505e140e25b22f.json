  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its excellent coherence, thoughtful experimental design, and complete fulfillment of the Criterion B requirements. The most significant flaw in Essay A is the direct contradiction between its research question, which states it is \"comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies,\" and its detailed methodology, which describes a primary data collection experiment (\"Dissolved 91 grams or 0.602 moles of Manganese Sulfate...\"). This fundamental incoherence undermines the entire exploration. In contrast, Essay B presents a highly focused and logical investigation. Its research question, \"How do different active ingredients... in different brands of indigestion tablets... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\", is clear, specific, and perfectly aligned with its described methodology.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking in its variable selection. While both essays correctly identify variables, Essay B provides a sophisticated justification for *not* controlling the mass of the tablets, stating, \"to give a realistic answer, the mass of each tablet will be kept as is.\" This reflects a mature understanding of how to design an experiment for real-world applicability. Essay A simply lists its controlled variables without such justification.\n\nFinally, while Essay A provides an exceptionally detailed safety assessment (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\"), it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations and its environmental note is generic (\"Laboratory standards were followed...\"). Essay B correctly addresses all three required components. It explicitly states, \"There are no ethical considerations for this experiment,\" and provides a specific environmental plan: \"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker, this is because hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes if poured down the drain.\" This completeness makes Essay B a more well-rounded and compliant response to the IB criteria. The critical flaw in Essay A's research design and its omission of a required section make Essay B the clear winner.",
