  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more scientifically rigorous approach to the investigation. Its research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused, clear, and investigates a sophisticated relationship between variables. The background section is excellent, providing a detailed theoretical framework that directly supports the hypothesis and methodology by discussing reaction rates, pKa values as a measure of acid strength, collision theory, and the Arrhenius equation. This level of detail shows a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry. The methodology is appropriate, outlining a kinetics study where reaction rates are measured at different temperatures to calculate activation energy, which is the correct procedure for answering the research question. The identification of independent, dependent, and controlled variables is precise and accurate. Finally, the safety and environmental considerations are specific and relevant, noting that \"iodopropanone is a lachrymator\" and that waste should be segregated into \"inorganic waste\" and \"organic waste.\"\n\nEssay B, while ambitious in scope, is significantly weaker in its execution. The research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources: chalk, rangoli powder, and seashells, as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\", is clear, but the subsequent sections lack scientific rigor. The background is largely narrative and lacks the theoretical depth of Essay A. Most critically, the methodology contains significant flaws that undermine the validity of the results; for example, it states \"50 cm\u00b3 of 2.0 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl was added... using a measuring cylinder\" and \"25 cm\u00b3 of the solution... was added to another conical flask... using a measuring cylinder.\" Using a measuring cylinder for these critical volume measurements in a titration introduces a very large uncertainty and is inappropriate for this technique. The identification of variables is also confused, listing \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable when it is the type of sample (chalk, rangoli, seashell) that is being intentionally changed. While Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are adequate, the fundamental flaws in its experimental design and theoretical grounding make it a weaker submission.\n\nTherefore, Essay A is superior due to its focused research question, strong theoretical background, appropriate and detailed methodology, and correct identification of variables.",
