  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental designs. Essay A has a clear research question: \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\". It provides relevant background information on milk chemistry and outlines a suitable complexometric titration procedure. The variables are correctly identified, and the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are addressed.\n\nHowever, Essay B is superior due to its greater depth and precision. Its research question is more focused and detailed: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\". This specificity is a hallmark of excellent experimental design. The background information in Essay B is also more thorough, including the relevant chemical equations and a full calculation justifying the concentration of the titrant used. Furthermore, Essay B\u2019s discussion of controlled variables includes a justification for the chosen range of the independent variable, directly linking it to the real-world context of the problem. While both essays discuss potential limitations, Essay B\u2019s section on weaknesses is more detailed, specific, and insightful, offering concrete improvements like using a colorimeter to standardize the endpoint. This higher level of detail, justification, and critical reflection makes Essay B the stronger submission.",
