  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B. Essay A presents a well-structured and clear investigation with a focused research question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". Its background information is relevant, its variables are thoroughly considered, and its safety, ethical, and environmental sections are detailed and specific, for example, noting that sulphuric acid \"must be neutralized first then disposed of... with sodium carbonate.\" Essay A is an exemplar of a methodically sound and complete experimental design.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a superior depth of exploration and personal engagement in the development of the methodology itself. While its research question is also excellent and specific, the key differentiator is the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section. Here, the student details a clear process of trial and error, stating, \"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately, through using a data logger... I found that the built-in lux sensor... could determine the changes in colour.\" This narrative of problem-solving and refining the data collection technique showcases a more authentic and sophisticated scientific process. Furthermore, Essay B's environmental considerations include a proactive step to minimize waste during the design phase: \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA,\" which reflects a higher level of consideration than post-experiment disposal alone. Although Essay A is flawless in its execution of the requirements, Essay B's detailed account of methodological development and its more complex topic demonstrate a more profound and personal level of exploration.",
