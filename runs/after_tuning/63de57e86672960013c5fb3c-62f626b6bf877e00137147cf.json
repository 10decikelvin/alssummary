  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the core components of IB Chemistry's Criterion B. Essay A is demonstrably superior across all assessed elements.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a research question that is not only clear but also exceptionally detailed and focused. It states: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". This specificity in the independent variable range and a key controlled parameter (time) sets a strong foundation for the entire investigation. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", lacks this detail, failing to specify the range of expiration dates or how \"significant\" variation will be measured.\n\nSecond, the background and methodology sections of Essay A are thorough and scientifically sound. The background logically connects personal interest to the relevant chemistry, including redox half-equations and Faraday's law. The methodology is a complete, replicable, step-by-step procedure. Essay B, however, is critically deficient in these areas; it offers virtually no scientific background beyond a single sentence defining titration and provides only an incomplete fragment of a procedure, omitting crucial sample preparation steps.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its treatment of variables. It explicitly identifies independent, dependent, and controlled variables, and for each controlled variable, it justifies why it must be controlled and describes precisely how this will be achieved (e.g., \"using a wooden splint... to ensure the same distance between the electrodes\"). Essay B entirely omits a dedicated variables section, a significant flaw in experimental design.\n\nFinally, while both essays are experimental and require safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations, Essay A handles them more completely. Essay A addresses all three aspects with specific details, such as naming hazardous chemicals (\"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive\") and providing concrete disposal instructions (\"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\"). Essay B provides good specific safety warnings but omits any mention of ethics and offers only a generic environmental statement: \"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately\". Due to its comprehensive, detailed, and scientifically robust approach, Essay A is the far better example of Criterion B.",
