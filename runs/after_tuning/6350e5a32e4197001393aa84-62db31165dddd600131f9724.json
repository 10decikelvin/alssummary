  "reasoning": "While Essay B demonstrates a stronger theoretical foundation in its background information, Essay A is superior overall as it provides a complete and well-structured exploration that meets all the required components of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's strength lies in its excellent background section, which provides deep context on the role of ascorbic acid as an antioxidant against free radicals and establishes clear personal engagement. It expertly links the hypothesis to underlying chemical principles, stating, \"The increased kinetic energy...would increase the rate of reaction, as according to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve theory.\" However, its research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is less specific than Essay A's, lacking details on ranges or measurement techniques. More critically, the provided text for Essay B is incomplete, omitting the methodology, a full variables list, and any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which are essential for an experimental investigation.\n\nConversely, Essay A presents a complete exploration. Its research question is more detailed, specifying sample volume and a controlled variable: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". Essay A includes a full, replicable methodology, correctly identifies all variables, and provides a thorough section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. For instance, it specifies disposal procedures: \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation so it minimises the risk to the environment.\" Although the scope of Essay A's investigation is perhaps overly ambitious (comparing water sources and measurement methods), it successfully addresses every required element of the criterion, making it a more complete and competent submission. The presence of a full methodology and explicit S/E/E considerations makes Essay A fundamentally better than the incomplete submission of Essay B.",
