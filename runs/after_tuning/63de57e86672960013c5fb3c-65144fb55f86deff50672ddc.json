  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the core components of IB Chemistry Criterion B: Exploration. While both essays present strong research questions and relevant background information, Essay A demonstrates a significantly more robust and complete experimental design.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exemplary in its clarity and specificity, detailing the exact independent variable values and a key controlled variable (time). Its methodology is presented in a clear, logical, step-by-step format that is easily replicable. Crucially, the 'Variables' section is outstanding; it not only identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables but also provides strong justification for the chosen range of the independent variable (\"2 to 6 volts are the most acceptable... their advice will be explored but also challenged\") and details the specific methods for managing each controlled variable. The safety, ethical, and environmental sections are thorough and specific to an experimental lab, correctly identifying hazards like H\u2082SO\u2084 and proposing concrete disposal methods like neutralization.\n\nEssay B's research question is also strong and specific: \"How does an increase in ionic radii... of central metal ions... (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting...?\" The background information is scientifically rich. However, the essay's structure and content for the methodology and variables are critically flawed. A dedicated 'Variables' section is absent, and the 'Methodology' section appears incomplete, starting abruptly at step 6. This lack of a clear, complete, and well-defined experimental plan is a major weakness for Criterion B. While its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are present and relevant, they cannot compensate for the fundamental gaps in the experimental design. Essay B does contain a very strong self-evaluation section that identifies significant flaws in its own methodology (e.g., \"the change in color from both [Fe and Mn] metal complexes... is due to the oxidation of the metal... and was not a result of a ligand exchange reaction\"), but this excellent reflection only serves to highlight the weakness of the initial exploration design itself.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A is superior because it presents a complete, well-reasoned, and meticulously planned investigation. Its clear and justified methodology and variable control demonstrate a much stronger fulfillment of Criterion B's requirements for a high-quality exploration design, which is paramount over a well-evaluated but flawed design.",
