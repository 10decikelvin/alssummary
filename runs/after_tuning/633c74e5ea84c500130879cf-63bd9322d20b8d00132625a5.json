  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more clearly defined and focused research question: 'How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?' compared to Essay B's question, 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?'. While both could be more specific, Essay A's framing is slightly better. Essay A provides a more thorough 'Background' section, referencing scientific definitions of solubility. Essay B's introduction is minimal, jumping directly into the experimental procedure without adequate context. In terms of methodology, Essay A's description of using a hot water bath and a temperature probe demonstrates a more controlled experimental setup than Essay B's less precise calorimetry method, which is highly susceptible to heat loss. Essay B does acknowledge this limitation, suggesting 'use a draught shield' as an improvement, but the initial method is less rigorous. While Essay A's list of controlled variables ('Boiling temperature', 'Cation group') is brief, it correctly identifies key parameters. Essay B does not explicitly list its controlled variables, which is a significant omission. For safety, Essay B is superior, stating, 'Personal protection equipment should be worn at all times during the experiment to prevent injuries such as burns,' and identifying specific hazards like fumes from paraffin wax. In contrast, Essay A only vaguely mentions 'surgical masks, gloves, and laboratory goggles.' Neither essay excels in its environmental considerations, though Essay B at least notes that 'paraffin wax is not biodegradable.' Ultimately, Essay A's stronger research question, clearer methodology, and more detailed background information make it the better of the two submissions, despite its weaker safety and environmental sections.",
