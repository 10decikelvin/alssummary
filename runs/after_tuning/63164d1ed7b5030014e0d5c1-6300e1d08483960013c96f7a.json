  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its more rigorous experimental design and its complete fulfillment of all Criterion B components, particularly safety considerations. While both essays present clear and focused research questions, Essay A's methodology and attention to detail are significantly stronger.\n\nBoth essays begin well with strong research questions and relevant background information. Essay A asks, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\" and provides a detailed chemical background on the redox titration used for quantification. Similarly, Essay B asks, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\" and effectively explains the theory of freezing point depression, even including the formula \"\u0394Tf = molality * Kf * i\".\n\nHowever, the quality diverges significantly in the methodology and variables. Essay A's method is more scientifically sound; it specifies repeating trials by \"taking 3 readings for each specified time amount\" and outlines strong variable controls, such as using a water bath to maintain a constant temperature of \"100 degrees Celsius\". In contrast, Essay B's methodology fails to mention any repeat trials, which is a major flaw in experimental design. Furthermore, it omits a critical controlled variable\u2014the initial mass or volume of the ice cubes\u2014and its method for controlling temperature (\"Experimenting in the same place and time\") is far less precise than Essay A's approach.\n\nThe most critical distinction is in the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A, an experimental investigation, correctly includes a \"Risk Assessment\" section. It provides specific safety precautions, such as to \"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware\" and notes how to handle chemicals like the iodine solution. It also explicitly addresses the other areas, stating \"No significant ethical concerns\" and \"No significant environmental concerns.\" Essay B, which is also an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethics, or environmental impact. This is a crucial failure for an experimental IA, making Essay A the clear winner.",
