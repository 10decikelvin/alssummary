  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent investigations, but Essay B is superior due to its significantly greater precision, depth, and thoroughness across all assessed elements of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". It clearly outlines concentrations, the exact range of the independent variable, the method of measurement, and the final value to be calculated. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is clear but less specific about the pH values, which are later described imprecisely as \"natural pH\", \"acidic pH of 3.0 - 4.0\", and \"alkaline pH of 9.0 \u2013 10.0\".\n\nThe background information in Essay B is more focused and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the underlying theory, directly linking the reaction mechanism, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation to justify its methodology. Essay A provides relevant information on BOD and the Winkler method, but it is more descriptive. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is strengthened by a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, indicating a more thoughtful and refined experimental design process.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety and environmental considerations is a major differentiator. Essay B provides a detailed, chemical-specific table outlining risks and mitigation, for example noting that iodopropanone is a \"lachrymator\" and that sulfuric acid waste should be neutralized with \"lime or soda ash\". Essay A's safety table is adequate, but its environmental consideration is a single, vague sentence: \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\". While both essays fail to explicitly address ethical considerations, Essay B's meticulous approach to safety and specific environmental protocols makes it a much stronger submission for Criterion B.",
