  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a higher quality of exploration (Criterion B) than Essay A. The superiority of Essay B begins with its research question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\" This phrasing is more sophisticated than Essay A's \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", as \"to what extent\" invites a more detailed, evaluative investigation. Furthermore, Essay B correctly identifies its dependent variable as \"Vitamin C content (ascorbic acid) of bell pepper 100g sample(mg),\" which is the final calculated value. In contrast, Essay A makes a significant error by stating its \"dependent variable will be the temperature difference after heating the solution,\" when the actual dependent variable is the specific heat capacity, which is calculated *from* the temperature difference. This indicates a weaker grasp of experimental design in Essay A.\n\nWhile both essays propose appropriate methodologies, Essay B's is more thoroughly detailed, including the preparation of the starch indicator solution. Essay B also provides a much stronger risk assessment. Its safety precautions are highly specific to the planned experiment, mentioning risks from the hot plate (\"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware, and check for cracks before heating\") and the iodine solution (\"Avoid getting iodine solution in eyes, on skin or on clothing\"). Essay A's safety points, such as \"Wearing safety goggles to prevent any glass...if a beaker falls and breaks,\" are comparatively generic. Finally, both essays explicitly address ethical and environmental concerns, fulfilling the criteria, but Essay B's overall precision in its research question, variable identification, and safety protocols makes it the clearly stronger example of Criterion B.",
