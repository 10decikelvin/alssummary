  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear, focused, and testable research questions. Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is strong because it specifies the independent and dependent variables as well as the method of calculation. Essay B's question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is similarly effective by explicitly stating the variable range. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior overall approach to the investigation's design. Its identification of variables is more thorough, as it not only details the controlled variables with justifications but also thoughtfully considers uncontrolled variables like \"Uniform Depth of Sample\" and the \"Rate of Water Evaporation,\" showing a deeper level of critical thinking about the experimental limitations. While Essay A's methodology is appropriate, Essay B's procedure is exceptionally detailed, outlining the use of specific software like Tracker and hardware like the LabQuest 2 sensor. The most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides an adequate safety section but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental impacts. In contrast, Essay B provides a comprehensive table covering all three aspects, with specific safety protocols, a thoughtful ethical discussion on using \"edible materials for an experiment,\" and clear instructions for environmental disposal, stating that the bioplastics \"should be disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes.\" This comprehensive and insightful approach makes Essay B stronger in Criterion B.",
