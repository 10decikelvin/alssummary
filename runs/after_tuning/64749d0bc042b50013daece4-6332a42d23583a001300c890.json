  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong, viable experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of rigor and thoroughness in its experimental design, making it the superior example for Criterion B.\n\nThe primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally well-formulated research question and its meticulous approach to variables. The RQ is not just clear, but highly specific: \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L)...measured through Winkler's titration?\" This level of detail sets a clear, focused scope from the outset. In contrast, Essay B's RQ, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction...?\", is perfectly acceptable but lacks the specific operational parameters that elevate Essay A.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's treatment of controlled variables is outstanding. It presents a comprehensive table detailing not only *what* was controlled, but *why* it needed control and *how* it was controlled. For example, it considers subtle factors like \"Exposure to atmospheric oxygen/air\" and explains its control: \"The main water solution was stored in a large BOD flask...all transfer pipette solutions were introduced under the surface of the solution to reduce the amount of oxygen introduced.\" Essay B's list of controlled variables is adequate but less extensive and lacks this depth of justification.\n\nBoth essays have relevant background information and appropriate methodologies. Essay A effectively uses literature graphs to substantiate its hypothesis, which is a nice touch. Regarding safety, both are good, but Essay A is more specific about disposal for multiple chemicals (\"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink\" for sulfuric acid) and lists explicit PPE (\"lab gloves, masks, lab coats and goggles\"). While Essay B correctly identifies hazards, its control measures are slightly more generic (\"Very careful operations during the experiment and following the safety rules of the laboratory at all times\").\n\nIn summary, while Essay B represents a solid IB Chemistry investigation, Essay A's precision in the research question and its exceptionally detailed and well-justified control of variables demonstrate a more sophisticated understanding of scientific exploration.",
