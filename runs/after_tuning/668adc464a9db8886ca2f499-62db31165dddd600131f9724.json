  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it provides a complete and detailed exploration of its research question, fulfilling all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B, while having a solid introduction and background, is critically incomplete.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly specific and focused research question: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". This is superior to Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", which lacks specific parameters like the temperature range or measurement technique.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology is thorough, replicable, and includes a crucial pre-test to determine the initial concentration of the commercial bleach. The variables are also clearly identified and justified; for instance, the control variables table explains why temperature must be controlled: \"temperature of the solvent affects the collision of molecules which in turn affects the reaction rate.\" In contrast, Essay B's text cuts off before detailing the methodology or variables, leaving a massive gap in its experimental design.\n\nFinally, Essay A demonstrates a strong awareness of safety and environmental protocols. It includes a detailed safety table for all chemicals and provides specific disposal instructions: \"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay B, which also describes an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw. While both essays have strong background information sections, Essay A's completeness in all other required areas makes it the clear winner.",
