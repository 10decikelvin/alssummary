  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its significantly stronger theoretical foundation, more precise experimental design, and correct identification of variables. Essay B's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused and establishes a clear relationship to be investigated. Its background section is exemplary, directly deriving the necessary theoretical framework from the Arrhenius equation and the second-order integrated rate law, demonstrating a high level of understanding. In contrast, Essay A's research question is a simpler comparison, and its background is more narrative-based than theoretical.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the handling of variables. Essay B correctly identifies the independent variable as \"The absolute temperature\" and the dependent variable as \"The rate constant,\" showing a clear grasp of experimental design. Essay A, however, makes a critical error by identifying the \"Independent\" variable as the \"Mass of sample before titrating,\" which is actually a controlled variable. This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how the experiment is structured. While both essays provide appropriate procedures and good safety considerations, Essay B's are more rigorously grounded. For instance, Essay B explicitly mentions all three considerations, stating, \"There were no notable ethical or environmental issues associated with this experiment,\" whereas Essay A omits any mention of ethics. Ultimately, Essay B's strong conceptual clarity and flawless experimental design make it a much higher-quality submission for Criterion B.",
