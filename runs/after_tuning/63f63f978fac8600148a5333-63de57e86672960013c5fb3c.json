  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B content, but Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific exploration and chemical understanding. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". Its background information is scientifically rigorous, detailing the specific functional groups in orange peels (pectin, cellulose) and explaining the effect of pH on biosorption using chemical principles like Le Chatelier's Principle. The most significant strength of Essay A is its \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which details a thoughtful, iterative process of methodological refinement. For example, the student notes, \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated... Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation.\" This demonstrates a mature scientific approach where the procedure is developed and justified based on empirical findings.\n\nEssay B is also very competent. Its research question is clear and specific: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". The personal engagement is clear, the background on electrolysis is solid, and the variables are well-controlled. Furthermore, its safety, ethical, and environmental section is exemplary, providing specific disposal methods such as neutralizing acid before disposal (\"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\").\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior because its exploration feels more authentic and in-depth. The justification for its methodology is more robust, including a comparison between spectrophotometry and titration, and the preliminary work showcases genuine scientific problem-solving. While Essay B follows a standard procedure very well, Essay A's exploration demonstrates a deeper engagement with the scientific process itself, from developing the rationale to troubleshooting and optimizing the experimental design.",
