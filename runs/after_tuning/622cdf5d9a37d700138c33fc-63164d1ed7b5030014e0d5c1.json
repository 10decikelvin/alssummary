  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its complete fulfillment of the Criterion B requirements, particularly regarding risk assessment, despite Essay A's more sophisticated scientific premise. Essay A presents a highly detailed and focused research question: \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created.\" Its background information is excellent, identifying a specific gap in the literature concerning real versus model foods, and its table of controlled variables is exemplary. However, Essay A critically fails by only addressing safety in its risk assessment, completely omitting any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is also clear and focused. While its scientific scope may be less ambitious than Essay A's, its execution of Criterion B is more thorough. Crucially, Essay B contains a dedicated \"Risk Assessment\" section that explicitly addresses all three required components. It details specific safety precautions, and then explicitly states \"B. Ethical Concerns: No significant ethical concerns\" and \"C. Environmental Concerns: No significant environmental concerns.\" Although brief, this explicit consideration meets the assessment criteria that Essay A misses. Therefore, because Essay B provides a complete and correct exploration by addressing safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, it is the superior submission.",
