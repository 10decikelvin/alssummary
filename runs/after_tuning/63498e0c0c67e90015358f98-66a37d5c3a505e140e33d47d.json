  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\", is superior in its detail, specifying the exact values for the independent variable and using the evaluative phrase \"To what extent\". In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is clear but lacks this level of initial specificity.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are strong, with appropriate procedures and excellent tables detailing controlled variables. Essay A's use of a spectrophotometer and a calibration curve is a sophisticated approach, and its controlled variables table is detailed. Similarly, Essay B's redox titration is a standard and appropriate method, and its variable table is also comprehensive.\n\nHowever, the most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. As both are experimental investigations, all three aspects are required. Essay B explicitly addresses all three, noting safety precautions like using \"tongs to prevent skin burns,\" ethical considerations by aiming to \"minimize the waste of such products,\" and environmental impact by stating the heating plate was \"powered off and unplugged when it was not used.\" While the environmental point is minor, its inclusion shows completeness. Essay A addresses safety well but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for an experimental investigation. This omission, combined with the slightly less detailed research question, makes Essay A weaker overall.",
