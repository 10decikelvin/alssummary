  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its greater depth, clarity, and critical thinking regarding the experimental design.\n\nFirst, both essays feature excellent, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", which is appropriately evaluative. Essay B asks, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", which is specific and clearly outlines a complex correlational study.\n\nHowever, Essay B's background information provides a richer and more detailed chemical context. While Essay A thoroughly explains the principles behind dissolved oxygen and the Winkler method chemistry (e.g., `Mn(OH)\u2082 + \u00bc O\u2082 + \u00bd H\u2082O \u2192 MnO(OH)\u2082`), Essay B delves deeper into the specific molecular interactions relevant to its samples, discussing how \"phosphoserine residues in caseins enable caseins to bind with calcium, forming calcium-phosphate bonding in casein micelles.\" This level of detail provides a stronger scientific foundation for comparing the different milk types.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the treatment of variables. Essay A correctly identifies its variables. In contrast, Essay B presents its controlled variables in a highly organized table and, crucially, identifies *uncontrolled* variables. By acknowledging potential issues like \"Colour assessment during titration\" and \"Storage conditions of milk,\" Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated and critical awareness of the experiment's limitations from the outset.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide good, specific safety and environmental considerations appropriate for their experimental work, Essay B's is slightly more comprehensive. For instance, its risk assessment specifies handling ammonia \"only under a fume cupboard\" and includes a thoughtful environmental point on sourcing milk from \"recycled cartons\". Although a minor point, it reflects a more holistic approach. Overall, Essay B's superior background depth and exceptional handling of variables make it the better submission.",
