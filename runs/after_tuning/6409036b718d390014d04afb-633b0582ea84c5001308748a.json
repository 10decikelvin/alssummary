  "reasoning": "Essay A is a superior example of Criterion B exploration due to its highly specific research question, detailed and justified methodology, and thorough consideration of variables and safety. First, Essay A's research question is exemplary in its detail, specifying not only the independent variable but also the exact values to be tested and their uncertainty: \"varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C)\". It also details precisely how the dependent variable will be measured: \"measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute\". In contrast, Essay B's research questions are clear but lack this specificity, asking more generally, \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\". Second, Essay A's methodology demonstrates significant personal engagement and problem-solving, explaining the iterative process of selecting a measurement tool: \"Initially, using a stopwatch... yielded mediocre results... experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately... I found that the built-in lux sensor... could determine the changes\". Essay B, being a data-based study, has a much simpler methodology focused on identifying sources: \"The data will be collected through ChemPub and Chemeo\". While appropriate for its type, it doesn't show the same depth of exploration. Finally, Essay A excels in its risk assessment, as required for an experimental investigation. It identifies specific chemical hazards (\"Potassium bromate... toxic if swallowed, and may cause cancer\") and details both safety mitigation (\"performed in the fume cupboard\") and environmental actions (\"volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three... disposed of by a certified lab technician\"). Essay B, as a data-based investigation, appropriately omits these, but Essay A's comprehensive handling of these necessary components further highlights its overall quality and thoroughness.",
