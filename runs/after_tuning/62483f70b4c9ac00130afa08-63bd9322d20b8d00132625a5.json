  "reasoning": "Essay A is stronger because it provides a complete and well-structured experimental design. The research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\" is focused, includes specific variables (temperature), and indicates an evaluative approach. The background information is thorough, explaining the chemical principles behind the experiment (Le Chatelier's principle) and exploring different measurement methods. The methodology is detailed and precise, including specific volumes and concentrations like \"500cm\u00b3 sample\" and \"0.01M sodium thiosulphate solution,\" and even incorporates learning from preliminary trials. Furthermore, it explicitly identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. In contrast, Essay B's provided text is incomplete. While it has a good safety and environmental section, mentioning that \"paraffin wax is not biodegradable, and its residue after it burns emits toxic fumes\", it lacks the introductory and background information necessary to understand the context and rationale for the investigation. The procedure provided is only a fragment, starting from step 7. While the research question is clear, the overall planning and justification demonstrated in Essay A are significantly more comprehensive and well-communicated.",
