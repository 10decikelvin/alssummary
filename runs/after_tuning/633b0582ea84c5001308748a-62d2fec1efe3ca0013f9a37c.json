  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior to Essay A in meeting the requirements for Criterion B. While both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is more focused and leads to a more sophisticated experimental investigation. Essay A's research is split into two questions which, while related, are essentially two separate database lookups.\n\nThe methodology is the key differentiator. Essay B outlines a well-designed, hands-on experiment. The procedure is detailed, including specific concentrations (\"2.0M propanone\", \"0.005M iodine solution\") and volumes (\"2:2:2:4 cm\u00b3\"), as well as instructions for preparing solutions. Crucially, it demonstrates a high level of engagement by identifying potential weaknesses in its own method, stating, \"when performing the experiment at temperatures other than room temperature, I added all the reagents to a separate boiling tube, which was at room temperature. This means that for example when I added cooled reagents to a boiling tube, the temperature of the mixture most likely lowered and did not stay constant.\" This shows a thorough understanding of the experimental design. In contrast, Essay A's methodology, while appropriate for a database study, is inherently less complex, involving data collection from specified online sources.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its treatment of variables and safety. The variables are presented clearly in a table, and the controlled variables are well-justified. Essay B's \"Safety and environmental considerations\" section is specific and comprehensive, addressing chemical hazards (\"propanone is highly flammable, irritating to the eyes and degreases the skin\") and correct disposal procedures (\"iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste\"). Essay A, being a database study, does not require such a section, but its absence means it doesn't demonstrate the same depth of planning as Essay B.",
