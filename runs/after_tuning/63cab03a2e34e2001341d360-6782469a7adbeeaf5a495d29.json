  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better as it exhibits a higher level of scientific inquiry, particularly in its research question, background research, and methodological design. Essay B's research question is exceptionally strong, being both focused and highly specific: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction... in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This level of detail, specifying the wavelength and concentration range, sets up a far more rigorous investigation than Essay A's question, which is confusingly worded by mentioning \"comparing secondary data\" despite describing a primary data collection experiment.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background is superior because it clearly identifies a research gap, stating, \"This lack of information further highlights the importance of my research, in filling research gaps that currently exist.\" It also delves deeper into the relevant chemical kinetics, explaining concepts like the \"Scavenging Effect\". Essay A's background provides good general context on pollution but lacks this specific, targeted scientific depth. Methodologically, Essay B excels by explicitly detailing its preliminary trials and how they informed the final procedure: \"during preliminary trials, it was found that using different cuvettes resulted in vastly different absorbance values. To circumvent this, the same cuvette was used during data collection\". This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design not present in Essay A, which follows a standard, albeit correct, procedure.\n\nBoth essays have strong, specific risk assessments; for instance, Essay A notes \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer\" and Essay B includes precautions for \"when the UV-Lamp was in operation to prevent eye damage\". However, both have similarly vague environmental statements about following lab standards and both omit any discussion of ethical considerations. Despite these shared minor weaknesses, Essay B's superior research question, in-depth background, and more sophisticated methodological development make it the clear winner.",
