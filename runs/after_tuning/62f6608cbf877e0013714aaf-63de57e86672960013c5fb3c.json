  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and competent explorations of their chosen topics. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and attention to detail across multiple aspects of Criterion B, making it the superior piece.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, Essay B's is exemplary in its specificity: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" This question clearly defines the independent variable's exact range and a key controlled variable (time) within its phrasing. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is clear and focused but lacks this embedded detail, which is provided later in the variables section.\n\nSecond, while Essay A's background section is strong, demonstrating a high level of chemical theory by deriving the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction (\"\\( \\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t \\)\"), Essay B excels in the practical design of the experiment. Its controlled variables section provides meticulous detail on *how* variables will be managed, such as using a marked wooden splint \"to ensure the same distance is kept between the electrodes for all trials.\" Essay A's control variables are correctly identified but the description of their management is less detailed.\n\nFinally, the most significant difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this section. Essay A's section is adequate, noting that \"sodium hydroxide is corrosive, gloves were worn at all times.\" However, Essay B's treatment is far more comprehensive. It not only identifies the hazards of copper sulfate but also explains its environmental impact as a \"pesticide to algae... harmful to the environment and aquatic life\" and provides specific, alternative disposal methods like neutralization (\"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\") and reclamation (\"remainder pure copper sulphate solution can be heated up in an evaporating basin to form copper sulphate crystals\"). This depth of consideration for the practical and environmental implications of the experiment sets Essay B apart as a more thoughtful and complete exploration.",
