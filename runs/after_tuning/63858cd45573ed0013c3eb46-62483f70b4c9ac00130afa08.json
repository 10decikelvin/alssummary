  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate strong components of Criterion B, but Essay B presents a more sophisticated and well-contextualized exploration. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is inherently evaluative and more complex than Essay A's relational question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken...?\". Furthermore, Essay B's background is exceptional; it frames the investigation within the significant real-world context of global warming and dissolved oxygen levels, stating, \"The idea for this investigation came about due to recent mass media coverage relating to global warming...\". It then thoroughly researches and explains multiple methods for measuring dissolved oxygen before detailing the complex chemistry of the Winkler method, providing a robust justification for its evaluative question.\n\nEssay A is also very strong, with a clear research question, focused background, and an excellent, detailed approach to controlling variables. For instance, the effort to control the catalyst's surface area by specifying, \"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure,\" shows a high level of methodological thought. Both essays correctly identify their investigations as experimental and provide specific safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A notes waste \"were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal,\" while Essay B provides a specific disposal instruction to \"dilute...with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\". While Essay A's methodology and control of variables are commendable, Essay B's superior intellectual framing\u2014moving beyond observing a relationship to critically evaluating a standard chemical procedure against a backdrop of a major environmental issue\u2014makes it the stronger piece of work. The depth of its background research and the evaluative nature of its research question demonstrate a higher level of exploration.",
