  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior due to its more sophisticated research question, deeper scientific background, and a more appropriate and robust methodology. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", establishes a clear relationship between variables and specifies the analytical method, which is a hallmark of a focused investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid...?\", while clear, is less investigative in nature. Essay B's background provides a detailed explanation of complex chemical principles like the \"diverse ion effect\" and \"ionic atmosphere,\" showing a strong grasp of the underlying theory. Essay A's background is relevant but covers more basic concepts.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology. Essay B employs a sophisticated and appropriate method using spectrophotometry and a calibration curve, which is well-suited to its research question. Conversely, Essay A's methodology has a critical flaw, which it acknowledges in its limitations: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This flaw means the chosen acid-base titration cannot accurately isolate and measure only the ascorbic acid concentration, undermining the validity of the entire experiment.\n\nBoth essays correctly identify their independent, dependent, and controlled variables in clear tables. However, both also share a significant weakness in omitting any explicit discussion of ethical and environmental considerations, which is a requirement for an experimental investigation. Essay B's safety section is slightly more thorough, mentioning \"Lab coat and gloves were worn while handling the chemicals,\" whereas Essay A dismisses the need for gloves. Ultimately, the fundamental methodological soundness and greater scientific depth of Essay B make it the stronger piece of work for Criterion B.",
