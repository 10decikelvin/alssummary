  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across nearly all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is more sophisticated than Essay B's \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\". Essay A's question not only investigates a relationship but also includes a secondary, high-level goal (determining activation energy), indicating a deeper level of engagement. The background information in Essay A is extensive and highly relevant, thoroughly explaining collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Arrhenius equation (`k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)`), which directly underpins the entire investigation. In contrast, Essay B's background is more superficial; its explanation that \"The ions of potassium nitrate are held in a rigid matrix of water molecules\" is a simplistic and somewhat inaccurate description of ionic dissolution and its effect on heat capacity.\n\nSecond, the methodology and control of variables are more rigorously detailed in Essay A. It specifies five distinct temperatures and five repetitions for each, demonstrating a robust experimental design aimed at ensuring reliability. Essay A also provides a comprehensive list of controlled variables, including \"The amount... and the molarity of the reactants,\" \"Laboratory conditions,\" and \"Apparatus used,\" with clear justification. Essay B's methodology is appropriate, but its list of controlled variables is less exhaustive, and its own evaluation section highlights significant procedural flaws, such as \"The calorimeters used were too old, therefore the copper vessels experienced a lot of current overloads, sometimes melted,\" which casts doubt on the quality of the data collection.\n\nFinally, and most critically for an experimental investigation, Essay A shows a far superior treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A identifies specific chemical hazards (\"Oxalic acid may be very hazardous when in contact with skin\") and, crucially, addresses environmental impact with specificity. It correctly identifies a hazardous product, stating, \"Disposal of potassium hydroxide solution... can be hazardous to aquatic life,\" and outlines a proper disposal plan: \"The solution was carefully disposed of as a hazardous waste.\" Essay B's approach is generic and incomplete. Its safety precautions are not chemical-specific, and its environmental consideration is limited to \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box,\" which fails to assess the environmental impact of potassium nitrate or provide any specific disposal protocol, a significant omission for an experimental IA.",
