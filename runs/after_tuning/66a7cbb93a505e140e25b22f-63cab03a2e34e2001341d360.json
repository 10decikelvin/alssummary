  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it presents a coherent, focused, and well-designed investigation from start to finish, which is the core of Criterion B. In contrast, Essay B suffers from a fundamental contradiction between its research question and its methodology, which represents a critical flaw in the exploration's design.\n\nEssay A's research question is exemplary in its clarity and specificity: \"How do different active ingredients... in different brands of indigestion tablets... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\". This question clearly outlines the independent variable (antacid brand/active ingredient), the dependent variable (volume of HCl), and the method, providing a solid foundation. The background information is directly relevant, explaining neutralization and providing balanced chemical equations for each antacid. The methodology, variables, and safety/ethical/environmental sections are all present, logical, and appropriate for the experimental investigation.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating ambition with a complex chemical procedure (Winkler's method), is critically flawed by its inconsistent design. The research question explicitly states the investigation will proceed \"by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies,\" but the entire methodology section details a primary data collection experiment. This contradiction indicates a severe lack of focus and planning. While Essay B's \"Risk Assessment\" section is exceptionally detailed and specific (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\"), this strength in one sub-criterion cannot compensate for the fundamental incoherence of the overall exploration. Furthermore, it omits any mention of ethical considerations, which Essay A correctly addresses by stating none apply.\n\nUltimately, a well-structured and logical investigation, even if methodologically simple like Essay A's, is of higher quality than a technically complex but poorly conceived one like Essay B's. The clarity and consistency of Essay A make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
