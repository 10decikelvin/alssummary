  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across multiple key aspects of Criterion B. While both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's exploration is more scientifically rigorous and thorough.\n\nFirst, Essay B's methodology is valid for its research question, whereas Essay A's contains a fundamental flaw. Essay A aims to measure ascorbic acid concentration using acid-base titration, but correctly identifies its own limitation: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH\". This non-selective method makes it impossible to determine the concentration of ascorbic acid specifically, invalidating the entire experimental design. In contrast, Essay B's method of measuring the time to produce a set volume of foam is a valid, if imprecise, proxy for reaction rate, and is appropriate for its research question.\n\nSecond, Essay B's consideration of variables is more meticulous. It identifies the need to control the \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" and describes a specific, if imperfect, method of control: \"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a deeper level of planning than Essay A.\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which Essay A largely omits. Essay B specifically discusses the risks of MnO\u2082 and H\u2082O\u2082 and justifies using a dilute solution to mitigate risk. It explicitly addresses ethics (\"no evident ethical considerations\") and environment (\"Manganese dioxide catalyst... collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\"). Essay A's safety section is minimal, dismissively stating \"No other special safety precautions are required,\" and it completely fails to address any ethical or environmental aspects, a significant omission for an experimental investigation.",
