  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific thought and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is more sophisticated and detailed. It asks, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\". This question is highly specific, naming the method under evaluation, the variable being measured, the medium, and the independent variable, while also including evaluative language (\"To what extent... a good way\"). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear but less detailed.\n\nSecond, Essay B's background research is far more comprehensive. It not only explains the relevant chemical principles like Le Chatelier's Principle but also critically evaluates different methodologies for measuring dissolved oxygen (\"the colorimetric method, an electrochemical or optical sensor... and the Winkler method\"), providing a robust justification for its procedural choice. Essay A's background on freezing point depression is relevant, but it lacks this depth of research and justification.\n\nThird, Essay B's methodology and variable control are scientifically sound. In contrast, Essay A contains a critical design flaw. Its background correctly identifies that the number of ions is the key factor, yet its methodology controls for salt mass (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt using a balance\"), not moles. This fundamental error undermines the entire investigation.\n\nFinally, Essay B excels in its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are entirely absent in Essay A. Essay B provides a detailed \"Risk Assessment\" for specific chemicals like \"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive\" and offers specific disposal instructions: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting\". Essay A's complete omission of a risk assessment for a hands-on laboratory experiment is a critical failure.",
