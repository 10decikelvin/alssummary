  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of IB Chemistry internal assessments, but Essay A demonstrates a higher level of rigor and detail in its experimental design and justification, making it the superior piece for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally well-focused and specific, explicitly stating the independent variable's exact values and the precise measurement technique. Essay B's question is also strong but less detailed. Essay A's background is comprehensive, explaining not only kinetics and the Beer-Lambert law but also the practical necessity and chemical theory behind performing a titration to determine the concentration of the commercial bleach, which shows excellent foresight and chemical understanding.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A's use of a spectrophotometer provides a more objective and precise means of data collection compared to Essay B's reliance on visual observation of a color change, which is subject to human error and perception. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of controlled variables is exemplary, presenting them in a table with detailed explanations for *why* each variable is significant and *how* it will be controlled (e.g., \"The temperature of the environment is a factor that affects the speed of the molecules... [controlled by] conducting the experiment in an environment where the temperature is almost the same every time.\"). Essay B identifies its variables correctly but provides less detailed justification.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety and environmental concerns appropriately for an experimental investigation, Essay A's safety precautions are more specific (\"Use gloves, eye goggles, lab coat, face protection\"). Essay B does explicitly address ethics (\"There were no ethical issues...\"), which Essay A omits, but this is a minor point in the context of the overall superior planning, precision, and depth of understanding demonstrated in Essay A's exploration.",
