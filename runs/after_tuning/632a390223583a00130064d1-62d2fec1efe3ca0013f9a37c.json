  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong and well-structured investigations. Essay B has a very clear and focused research question: \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\". The background information provides excellent theoretical context, directly linking the rate law, pKa values, and the Arrhenius equation to the methodology. The method itself is classic and appropriate for determining activation energy. However, Essay A is superior for a few key reasons.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is more detailed by explicitly stating the range and intervals of the independent variable.\n\nSecond, while both essays do a good job identifying variables, Essay A's treatment is more thorough. It not only lists and justifies controlled variables in a clear table but also identifies \"Uncontrolled Variables\" like \"Uniform Depth of Sample\" and the \"Rate of Water Evaporation from Plastic\", thoughtfully considering their potential impact on the results. This demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking about the experimental design.\n\nThird, Essay A provides a more complete assessment of the investigation's context. While both essays have strong safety and environmental considerations appropriate for their respective experiments, Essay A also includes an \"Ethical\" consideration regarding the \"Use of edible materials\". Essay B completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a required component of this criterion for an experimental investigation. The inclusion of this aspect, alongside the more detailed variable analysis, gives Essay A the edge.\n\nFinally, Essay A's methodology incorporates modern technology like a \"Vernier LabQuest 2\" and \"Tracker Software\" to improve data accuracy, which is commendable. In contrast, Essay B relies on \"the naked eye\" to time the reaction, which it correctly identifies as a potential source of error. Therefore, due to its more thorough handling of variables and its complete coverage of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay A is the stronger piece of work for this criterion.",
