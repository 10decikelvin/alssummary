  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its rigorous and scientifically sound experimental design, particularly concerning the identification and control of variables. Essay A presents a highly specific and focused research question: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\". This RQ clearly defines the independent variable (temperature) with a precise range, the dependent variables (Acid Value and Saponification Value), and the methods. Furthermore, its 'Controlled Variables' table is exemplary, detailing not just what is controlled (e.g., \"Time period\"), but specifically how (\"Oil was heated for a time period of 60 minutes(3600s)\") and why (\"Time is one of the other variable which affects quantity of FFA in sample\"). Essay A also successfully addresses all safety, ethical (\"There were no ethical issues...\"), and environmental (\"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines...\") considerations as required for an experimental investigation.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B contains significant flaws in its experimental design. The most critical error is the misidentification of the independent variable. The essay states the independent variable is the \"Mass of sample before titrating,\" when in fact the independent variable is the *source* of the calcium carbonate (chalk, rangoli powder, or seashells). This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design. Additionally, the control of a key variable for the thermal decomposition method is extremely weak; the essay suggests controlling temperature by using \"the same Bunsen Burner... for each trial,\" which is an inadequate method for maintaining a constant and known temperature, a fact the student even acknowledges later in the evaluation. Finally, while Essay B addresses safety and environmental concerns, it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, failing to meet that specific criterion. While Essay B's research question is clear, the foundational weaknesses in its variable identification and control make Essay A the much stronger submission.",
