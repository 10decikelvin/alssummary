  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality Criterion B sections. Essay A's research question is exemplary: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator...?\" It is specific, providing the exact temperatures and how the dependent variable will be measured. Its background connects the abstract BZ reaction to reaction kinetics, collision theory, and even real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia research. The methodology is well-justified, particularly the section \"Choice of Materials and Method,\" which details the process of selecting the lux sensor over other options.\n\nEssay B also features a strong research question: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\" It clearly defines the independent variable's range and the dependent variable. The methodology is very thorough, including a detailed procedure for both creating the plastic and testing it with modern technology like Vernier sensors and Tracker software. A significant strength of Essay B is its identification of not just controlled variables but also uncontrolled variables, such as the \"Uniform Depth of Sample,\" showing a higher level of methodological reflection.\n\nWhile both essays are excellent, Essay B has a slight edge due to its more comprehensive approach. Essay B's safety, environmental, and ethical considerations section is superior. It not only addresses safety (\"Handling of glass...Transport glass containers with clamps or heat resistant gloves\") and environmental impact (\"they should be compostable and easily biodegradable\") but also includes a thoughtful ethical consideration: \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted.\" This level of consideration is absent in Essay A. Furthermore, the explicit identification of uncontrolled variables in Essay B demonstrates a more critical evaluation of the experimental design.",
