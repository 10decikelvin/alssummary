  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations with clear research questions and appropriate methodologies. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and detail, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\". It clearly states the independent variable (pH with specific levels), the dependent variable (mass of iron(II)), the source of the iron, and the precise analytical technique. The background information is thorough, linking the experiment to a real-world context (anemia) and providing detailed chemical principles, including the relevant redox equations and a justification for the concentration of KMnO\u2084 used. The methodology is meticulous, specifying precise glassware (e.g., \"25.00 \u00b1 0.03cm\u00b3 pipette,\" \"50.00cm\u00b3 burette\") and a systematic approach to controlling variables. The Safety, Ethical, and Environmental (SEE) section is also superior, providing specific disposal instructions for chemicals like HCl and KMnO\u2084, which is critical for a lab-based investigation.\n\nEssay B's research question is also good, but slightly less focused as it investigates two independent variables (temperature and type of juice). While the background information is adequate, it lacks the depth of Essay A's preliminary calculations. The methodology in Essay B is a significant weakness; it specifies using a measuring cylinder for the analyte (\"Measure 20 mL of certain juice using a 50 mL cylinder\"), which is far less precise than the pipette used in Essay A. Furthermore, a critical variable\u2014the duration of heating\u2014is not controlled, which would significantly impact the degradation of vitamin C and thus the validity of the results. The environmental considerations are also weak, focusing only on electricity usage (\"it was powered off and unplugged when it was not used\") and completely omitting any mention of chemical waste disposal.\n\nIn conclusion, while both essays follow the correct structure, Essay A exhibits a greater depth of understanding in its planning, demonstrates superior precision in its proposed methodology, and provides a more comprehensive and responsible consideration of safety and environmental impacts.",
