  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and demonstrate strong engagement with Criterion B, but Essay A is superior due to its more focused and well-supported exploratory phase. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3...1.000mol dm^-3)...?\". This specificity in substance mass, variable ranges, and measurement method provides a stronger foundation than Essay B's functional but less precise RQ: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures...\". Furthermore, Essay A's background section clearly links collision theory to the expected outcome, while Essay B's background admits a weakness, stating the \"Effect of increasing temperature on Saponification Value (SV) cannot be hypothesized due to lack of availability of research\". While both essays have excellent and appropriate methodologies with well-controlled variables, Essay A's mention of using pre-tests to refine the IV range demonstrates a stronger iterative design process. Finally, Essay A provides a more specific environmental plan, stating that \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\", whereas Essay B is more generic, mentioning chemicals were \"disposed of with lab guidelines\" without detailing them.",
