  "reasoning": "While both essays represent competent work, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of detail, precision, and scientific rigor in its planning. The research question in Essay B, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is significantly more precise than Essay A's, as it specifies the exact range of the independent variable and the method of measurement. Essay B's background information is also more thorough, providing a clear chemical equation and a calculation to justify the concentration of the titrant used. Furthermore, the justification for the chosen range of the independent variable in Essay B shows evidence of preliminary experimentation and refinement: \"I noticed that when experimenting with HCl of pH range 2.0 to 4.0, the difference between the volume of KMnO\u2084 used was rather small thus, resulting in inconclusive results. Therefore, I changed the range used to pH 2.0 to 6.0 to obtain an observable trendline.\" This level of planning and justification is less evident in Essay A. Finally, Essay B's discussion of environmental considerations is more specific, noting that KMnO\u2084 is \"'Toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects'\" and requires disposal in a sealed container, whereas Essay A provides more generic disposal advice. Although Essay A is a solid plan, Essay B excels in its meticulous detail and scientific justification throughout the exploration section.",
