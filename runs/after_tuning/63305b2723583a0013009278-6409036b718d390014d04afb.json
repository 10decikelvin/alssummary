  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed investigations. Essay A has a clear research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", which is focused and includes specific variables. The methodology is appropriate, and the safety and environmental considerations are well-addressed, noting that \"Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic to aquatic organisms and hazardous to the aquatic environment. Hence, it was disposed as a hazardous waste.\" However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and depth. Its research question, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", is more complex and specific. The background information in Essay B is more thorough, linking kinetic theory and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves directly to the hypothesis. Critically, Essay B's methodology includes a dedicated section on the \"Choice of Materials and Method,\" which details the preliminary work and rationale for selecting specific equipment, such as using a lux sensor over visual observation. This demonstrates a more thoughtful and rigorous approach to experimental design. While both essays correctly identify variables and address safety, Essay B's comprehensive justification for its experimental choices makes it the stronger of the two.",
