  "reasoning": "Essay B is unequivocally superior as it demonstrates a much stronger and more thorough approach to the experimental design process described in Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This question is focused, detailed, and measurable, specifying the exact range for the independent variable and the concentrations of reactants. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...\", is a broad feasibility query that lacks specific conditions or ranges.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its identification and control of variables. It correctly identifies the independent variable as \"Temperature of reaction solutions \u00b0C\" and the dependent variable as \"Absorbance,\" which is then used to find Kc. Its detailed table of controlled variables explains both *why* and *how* each is controlled. Essay A, however, makes a critical error by incorrectly identifying its variables, stating the \"Independent\" variable is the \"Temperature change\" and the \"Dependent\" is \"Different types of substances dissolved...\". This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is also more robust, including a section on \"Preliminary experiments\" which justifies key procedural choices, such as adding nitric acid and allowing 15 minutes for equilibrium. Essay A's methodology is followed by a lengthy evaluation explaining why the experiment failed due to issues like low concentrations, suggesting poor initial planning. Finally, Essay B provides comprehensive and specific safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. For instance, its environmental section notes that specific chemicals \"need to be neutralised\" before disposal. Essay A has good safety points but completely omits an ethical consideration and its environmental note is a generic statement to \"be disposed of in the designated container.\"",
