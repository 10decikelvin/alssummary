  "reasoning": "While both submissions attempt a quantitative investigation, Essay B is superior in its rigor, clarity, and depth. The research question in Essay B (\"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy.\") is more focused and scientifically sophisticated than Essay A's (\"What is the effect of different masses of stearin on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\"). Essay B provides a strong theoretical background explaining collision theory and the Arrhenius equation, directly linking them to the experimental goal. In contrast, the provided text for Essay A lacks this theoretical depth. \n\nFurthermore, the methodology and variable control in Essay B are clearly defined and well-structured, listing independent, dependent, and controlled variables explicitly. For instance, it specifies concentrations like \"0.5 M\" oxalic acid and temperatures like \"71\u00b0C, 61\u00b0C, 48.5\u00b0C, 36.5\u00b0C or 23\u00b0C\". Essay A's description of its variables and procedure is less clear. Finally, while both address safety, Essay B's risk assessment is more specific, correctly identifying the hazards of named chemicals (e.g., \"Oxalic acid may be very hazardous when in contact with skin\") and appropriate disposal methods (\"disposed of as a hazardous waste\"), showing a greater level of engagement with experimental design and safety protocols. Essay A's safety section is more generic in comparison.",
