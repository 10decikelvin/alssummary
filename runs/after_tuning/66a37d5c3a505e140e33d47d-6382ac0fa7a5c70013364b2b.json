  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong, focused, and detailed research questions suitable for an IB Chemistry investigation. Essay A asks, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\", clearly specifying variables, conditions, and measurement technique. Essay B's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\", is also excellent, setting up a robust comparison of methods. However, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and methodologically sound exploration.\n\nEssay A's methodology is appropriate and feasible within a school lab context. In contrast, Essay B's investigation contains a significant, self-identified flaw in its experimental design. The student correctly notes in their evaluation that the thermal decomposition method was flawed: \"I deduced that the thermal decomposition would yield more inaccurate results due to this systematic error\" because the Bunsen burner could not achieve the required decomposition temperature of 700-850\u00b0C. While this shows good reflection, it points to a fundamental weakness in the exploration's design. Essay A's design, using a standard titration and a heating plate, is sound and well-suited to its research question.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides a complete and thoughtful treatment of all three aspects. It specifically addresses safety (heating plate, iodine), environmental impact (\"excessive energy consumption\"), and includes a nuanced ethical consideration: \"Considering the inequality of access to food in poorer areas of the world, the least possible amount of fruits was used... to minimize the waste\". Essay B has a thorough safety section and a valid environmental point regarding disposal, but it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations. For an experimental IA, addressing all three components is required, and this omission is a critical flaw. Therefore, Essay A is superior due to its methodologically sound design and its comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements.",
