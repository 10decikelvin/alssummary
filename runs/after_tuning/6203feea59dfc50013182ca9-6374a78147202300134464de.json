  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is better. Both essays describe valid experimental investigations, but Essay A demonstrates a higher quality of exploration across most key criteria.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is more detailed and specific: \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\". It clearly outlines the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (BOD), a specific timeframe (5 days), and the analytical technique (Winkler method). Essay B's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is also specific with quantities but describes a simpler, more standard experiment.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology and variable control are more sophisticated and thoroughly explained. The experimental design, involving a 5-day incubation period and titrations, is more complex than the simple calorimetry in Essay B. Furthermore, Essay A's controlled variables are presented in a detailed table that not only lists the variables but explicitly states *how* they are controlled, such as \"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard area away from sunlight\" to control temperature. Essay B lists controlled variables but with less justification.\n\nThird, Essay A's treatment of safety is significantly more robust. It provides a table listing each key chemical, its purpose, and its specific \"Potential Dangers/Risks,\" such as \"Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\" for H\u2082SO\u2084. Essay B's safety assessment is much more general, stating only, \"I also wore gloves and laboratory glasses when carrying out the experiment.\" While Essay B does a better job of explicitly addressing ethical considerations by stating \"I took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions,\" which Essay A omits, this does not outweigh the superior experimental design and safety assessment in Essay A.\n\nIn summary, Essay A presents a more ambitious, better-planned, and safer investigation, making it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
