  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger due to its highly focused research question, meticulous experimental design, and deeper engagement with chemical principles. Essay B's research question is exceptionally specific, stating the exact independent variable values to be tested: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect... measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen... from different water sources...\", is less focused by introducing a second, poorly defined variable (\"different water sources\") which complicates the investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is supported by a \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that thoughtfully justifies the selection of the lux sensor over other options, demonstrating a mature approach to experimental design. Essay B also presents a superior table of controlled variables, providing clear \"Reason for Controlling\" and \"Method of Control\" for factors like \"Speed of Magnetic Stirrer,\" which is more detailed than Essay A's variable table. While both essays have strong safety and environmental considerations, Essay B shows a higher level of engagement by not only detailing disposal but also proactively reducing the experiment's impact, stating, \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" Although Essay A is a competent investigation that correctly identifies variables and follows a standard procedure, Essay B's precision, depth of background, and thoughtful methodological development mark it as the superior work in Criterion B.",
