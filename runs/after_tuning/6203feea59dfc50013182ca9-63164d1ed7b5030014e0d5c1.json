  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong, focused investigations appropriate for the IB Chemistry level. However, Essay B is superior due to its more complete and rigorous adherence to the formal requirements of Criterion B, particularly regarding the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is clear and specific, as is its methodology. The background information on BOD and the Winkler method is relevant and detailed. Its primary weaknesses lie in its controlled variables and its safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) section. The method for temperature control, \"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard area away from sunlight,\" is less precise than a dedicated incubator. More critically, while it addresses safety and provides a vague environmental note (\"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\"), it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a significant oversight in an experimental investigation.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is also clear and focused, using evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). Its methodology is appropriate, and its variables are well-defined with strong controls, such as keeping the \"Temperature Of Water Bath... constant at 100 degrees Celsius\". The key strength of Essay B lies in its comprehensive Risk Assessment. It provides specific safety precautions relevant to its procedure (\"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware\") and, crucially, explicitly addresses the other required components, stating, \"Ethical Concerns: No significant ethical concerns\" and \"Environmental Concerns: No significant environmental concerns.\" By explicitly stating that these factors were considered and deemed not significant, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough understanding of the formal requirements of a scientific investigation than Essay A, which simply omits ethics.\n\nTherefore, while both essays describe sound scientific work, Essay B's complete and explicit treatment of all Criterion B components makes it the stronger submission.",
