  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations, but Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated engagement with methodology and its more thorough scientific context.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying temperature... affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator...\", is highly focused and investigates a more complex chemical phenomenon. Its background information is exemplary, linking the specific reaction to broader principles like collision theory, Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, and autocatalysis, while also providing compelling real-world context like cardiac arrhythmia. The standout feature of Essay B is its \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which details a thoughtful, iterative process of experimental design, including rejecting alternatives like visual observation and a colorimeter in favor of a lux sensor, and even modifying the glassware for better results. This demonstrates a high level of personal engagement. Furthermore, its safety, ethical, and environmental section is robust, noting specific chemical hazards (\"Potassium bromate... may cause cancer\") and detailing practical environmental mitigation (\"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three... resulting solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\").\n\nEssay A's research question, \"...how does the temperature... affect its calcium content... by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is also clear and well-defined. The background information on calcium nutrition and EDTA titration is relevant and sufficient. The methodology is appropriate, and the justification for choosing complexometric titration over other methods is a strength. The variables are well-defined, and the safety precautions are thorough, for instance, correctly identifying the need to use a fume cupboard for the ammonia buffer. However, its environmental consideration, while present (\"reduce the tendency of food wastage\"), is less chemically rigorous than Essay B's focus on chemical waste disposal. Overall, Essay A is a very competent and well-structured investigation but lacks the depth of scientific inquiry and personal engagement in methodological development that makes Essay B exceptional.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is a strong piece of work that meets all the required criteria effectively, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific maturity, reflected in its sophisticated topic, in-depth background, and particularly its reflective and well-documented approach to developing a sound experimental methodology.",
