  "reasoning": "Essay A is better as it demonstrates a more thorough and consistently high-quality approach across all elements of Criterion B, particularly in the foundational research question. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\", is exemplary because it is highly specific, including the exact variable ranges, the substances being tested, and the precise measurement technique all within a single, focused sentence. In contrast, while Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear, it lacks this level of embedded detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A provides more specific safety considerations tailored to its procedure, noting that \"Iodine may cause severe skin and eye irritation and burns\" and that tongs will be used with the heating plate to \"prevent skin burns.\" Essay B's safety section is slightly more generic, stating \"All lab safety equipment was worn at all times,\" without explicitly mentioning the primary risk of flammability associated with ethanol and gasoline. While Essay B should be commended for its excellent justification of variable ranges and its inclusion of a dedicated \"Assumptions\" section, which shows deep critical thinking, Essay A's stronger foundational elements give it the overall edge. Both essays have well-structured methodologies and variable tables, but Essay A's superior RQ and more detailed risk assessment make it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
