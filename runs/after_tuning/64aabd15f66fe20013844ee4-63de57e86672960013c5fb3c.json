  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A. While both essays present well-defined and specific research questions, Essay B excels in its methodological soundness, depth of variable control, and comprehensive coverage of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is supported by a robust and appropriate methodology. In contrast, Essay A's methodology is fundamentally flawed for its research question. Essay A aims to measure the concentration of ascorbic acid but proposes an acid-base titration, a method that measures total acidity. The essay itself acknowledges this critical flaw in its limitations table, stating, \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This poor choice of methodology undermines the entire investigation from the outset.\n\nSecond, Essay B displays a more sophisticated understanding of controlled variables. It not only identifies key variables like \"The surface area of the electrodes\" and \"Distance between the electrodes\" but also provides detailed explanations of how and why they must be controlled. Essay A's variable table is adequate but lacks this level of detailed scientific justification.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) aspects reveals a significant gap in quality. Essay B provides a thorough risk assessment. It details specific safety precautions for corrosive chemicals (\"When handling sulphuric acid, wear gloves, a lab coat, and a pair of safety glasses\"), explicitly addresses ethics (\"There are no ethical issues to be considered\"), and offers specific, responsible environmental disposal methods (\"Sulphuric acid... must be neutralized first then disposed of\"). Essay A, despite being an experimental investigation, almost completely neglects this area. It provides minimal safety notes, such as \"Gloves are not necessary,\" and entirely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for Criterion B.\n\nIn summary, Essay B's sound methodology, superior control of variables, and exemplary handling of safety, ethical, and environmental protocols make it a much stronger example of a well-planned scientific exploration compared to Essay A.",
