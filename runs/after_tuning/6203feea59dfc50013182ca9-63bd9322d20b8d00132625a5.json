  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a stronger overall investigation design than Essay B, primarily due to its well-defined research question and a more robust methodology. Essay A's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is highly focused, specifying the independent variable (pH), the dependent variable (BOD), the duration, and the measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", lacks specificity regarding the range of masses or the measurement method. While both essays provide adequate background information, Essay A's methodology is significantly more detailed, outlining the specific concentrations of reagents (\"1% concentrated MnSO\u2084\", \"80.0% concentrated H\u2082SO\u2084\") and procedures (\"inverted and shaken in multiple attempts and left to settle for 10 minutes\"). Essay B's procedure is comparatively vague, missing crucial details like the exact mass of water used. Both essays correctly identify their independent and dependent variables. However, Essay A's handling of controlled variables is more comprehensive, presented in a clear table format that explicitly states how each variable will be controlled. Essay B mentions some controls like using the same equipment but lacks this level of detail. Finally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay A's approach is slightly more thorough by integrating specific chemical hazards and disposal plans directly into the experimental design section. Essay B's section is more general and its claim that \"paraffin wax is not biodegradable\" is a common misconception, weakening its credibility slightly. Therefore, due to the superior clarity, detail, and scientific rigor evident in its research question and methodology, Essay A is the better submission.",
