  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its scientifically sound methodology, more sophisticated research question, and comprehensive consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its appropriate choice of experimental design; it uses a redox titration with iodine, which is a standard and specific method for quantifying ascorbic acid. The background information directly supports this choice, explaining, \"The beverages (analytes) were titrated with iodine to oxidise ascorbic acid into dehydroascorbic acid... The endpoint...was indicated by the soluble starch...which detected the excess of iodine\". In stark contrast, Essay B employs a fundamentally flawed methodology. It proposes using an \"acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide\". This method will neutralize all acids present in the orange juice (citric, malic, etc.), not just ascorbic acid, making it impossible to answer the research question accurately. The student even acknowledges this fatal flaw in their limitations, stating, \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This choice of an inappropriate methodology is a critical failure in the exploration stage.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's research question is more detailed and focused on exploring a relationship: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime)...\". This is more complex than Essay B's simpler comparative question. Finally, Essay A provides specific and thoughtful safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It mentions using \"tongs to prevent skin burns\" from the heating plate, an ethical consideration to \"minimize the waste\" of fruit, and an environmental point about powering off equipment to reduce \"excessive energy consumption\". Essay B's coverage is critically weak, dismissing safety with \"Gloves are not necessary\" and completely omitting any mention of ethical or environmental issues, which is a significant oversight for an experimental investigation.",
