  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality across all assessed elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is significantly more focused and detailed. It specifies the exact conditions and measurements: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear but lacks the same level of scientific precision. Furthermore, Essay B's background is more sophisticated, linking the experiment to Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation, whereas Essay A's background, while relevant, is more foundational.\n\nSecond, the methodology and control of variables in Essay B are far more rigorous. Essay B presents a detailed, two-part procedure that includes a calibration curve and specifies precise measurements (e.g., \"5.00 cm\u00b3 (\u00b10.05 cm\u00b3) graduated pipette\"). Its table of controlled variables is extensive and well-justified. Essay A's methodology has a significant flaw in its sequential design, which fails to properly control for ambient conditions, and it is vague on controlling a key variable, the initial mass and surface area of the ice, simply stating \"identical ice cubes\".\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B includes a comprehensive section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, as is required for an experimental investigation. It specifically identifies chemical hazards (\"Potassium thiocyanate is harmful by inhalation...Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\") and outlines proper disposal (\"All 3 chemicals should be kept away from drains, surface and groundwater\"). Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethics, or environmental impact, which is a major deficiency for a lab-based investigation. Due to its superior research question, robust methodology, and complete inclusion of all required Criterion B components, Essay B is the clear winner.",
