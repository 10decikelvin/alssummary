  "reasoning": "Essay A is the better submission as it demonstrates a much stronger and more scientifically rigorous experimental design, which is the cornerstone of Criterion B. While Essay B presents a more complex chemical procedure and a more detailed risk assessment, its foundational design is critically flawed.\n\nEssay A's primary strength is its clear, focused, and testable research question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\". This question establishes a clear relationship between a quantifiable independent variable (\"Time spent in the water bath (min.)\") and a measurable dependent variable (\"Vitamin C content... of bell pepper\"). The variables are correctly identified, and the controlled variables, such as \"Type and brand of bell pepper\" and \"Temperature Of Water Bath,\" are relevant and demonstrate thoughtful planning to ensure a fair test. The methodology is appropriate, safe, and directly addresses the research question.\n\nConversely, Essay B is built on a weak foundation. Its research question is convoluted and contradictory, stating it will be \"comparing secondary data\" while also detailing an experimental procedure \"by using Winkler's method\". More importantly, its independent variable is identified as \"4 different Water bodies,\" which is not a valid scientific variable. The actual intended variable, \"pollution level,\" is not measured or controlled but is instead qualitatively and subjectively ranked. This fundamental flaw in the experimental design undermines the validity of any conclusions drawn. Although Essay B's methodology is procedurally detailed and its risk assessment is impressively thorough, citing specific dangers like \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer,\" these strengths cannot compensate for the poorly conceived investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A is superior because its entire exploration is logically sound, from its well-defined research question to its controlled variables and appropriate methodology. Essay B, despite its procedural detail, fails on the fundamental principles of experimental design, making Essay A the stronger example of Criterion B.",
