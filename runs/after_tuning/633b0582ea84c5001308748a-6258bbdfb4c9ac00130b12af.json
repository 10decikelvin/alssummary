  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better as it exhibits a much higher level of detail, specificity, and scientific rigor across all assessed elements of Criterion B. While Essay A presents a competent data-based investigation, Essay B's experimental design is planned and articulated with exceptional clarity.\n\nThe superiority of Essay B begins with its research question, which is far more detailed and focused. Essay B asks: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration.\" This RQ explicitly states the independent variable's range, the dependent variables, and the methods used. In contrast, Essay A's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this high degree of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology and control of variables are exemplary. It provides a step-by-step, reproducible experimental procedure, including chemical preparation and justification for the methods chosen. The variables section includes a comprehensive table outlining six controlled variables, with dedicated columns explaining \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\". For instance, it identifies \"Microbial Contamination\" and explains it's controlled because \"If contamination increased free fatty acid content will also increase.\" Essay A appropriately identifies its variables, including the control of using \"only linear primary alcohols,\" but its methodological description is brief and inherent to a simpler data-based study.\n\nFinally, as an experimental investigation, Essay B includes a thorough and specific risk assessment. The table details hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and provides concrete \"Precautionary Measures\" such as to \"Keep such liquid away from fire and hot objects\". It also explicitly addresses ethical and environmental considerations, noting \"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines\". Essay A is a data-based study, so the lack of a lab risk assessment is acceptable; however, Essay B's complete and thoughtful engagement with these crucial aspects for its investigation type highlights its overall higher quality.",
