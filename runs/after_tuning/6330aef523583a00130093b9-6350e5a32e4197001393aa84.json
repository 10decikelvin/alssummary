  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration of its topic compared to Essay A. The superiority of Essay B begins with its research question: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". This question is focused, detailed, and establishes a clear relationship between the independent and dependent variables while also specifying key controlled parameters. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\", is a less sophisticated feasibility question. A major flaw in Essay A is its fundamental misunderstanding of variables, incorrectly identifying the \"Independent\" variable as \"Temperature change\" and the \"Dependent\" as \"Different types of substances\". Essay B, however, correctly identifies its variables with clear justification in a table format.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its methodology and consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. Its procedure is meticulously detailed across multiple stages, appropriate for a complex titration. Both essays describe experimental work, but Essay B's approach to safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is far more thorough. Essay B explicitly addresses all three areas in a dedicated section, stating, \"No animal or human being was harmed for the success of this experiment\" for ethics and providing specific disposal instructions like \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation so it minimises the risk to the environment.\" Essay A, on the other hand, provides adequate safety rules but only mentions disposal briefly (\"the chemicals must be disposed of in the designated container\") and completely omits any ethical considerations, which is a significant oversight for an experimental investigation. While Essay A's background is relevant, Essay B's is more comprehensive, linking the chemical principles to a real-world context of fish farming and thoroughly explaining the Winkler method. Due to the superior research question, correct identification of variables, and comprehensive handling of methodology and S/E/E factors, Essay B is clearly the better submission.",
