  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better than Essay A. The primary distinction lies in the depth of scientific exploration and personal engagement evident in its methodology, as well as its comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is highly specific, including evaluative language (\"To what extent\") and the precise commercial product being tested. Essay A's question is clear but lacks this level of nuance. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology shows significant problem-solving; the author identifies an issue with precipitate formation and devises a sophisticated solution, stating, \"To address this issue, I chose to implement the concept micelles formation...Crystal violet was chosen for this investigation to instigate micelle formation.\" This detailed account of pilot studies contrasts with Essay A's more standard, though appropriate, procedure.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify variables, Essay B provides a more exhaustive list of controlled variables, enhancing its rigor. The most critical differentiator, however, is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B, an experimental investigation, explicitly addresses all three. It provides specific safety notes (\"SDS causes serious eye irritation\"), an ethical statement (\"To adhere by the principles of green chemistry and avoid wastage, the minimal necessary quantity of chemical substances will be used.\"), and environmental protocol (\"Chemical waste must be disposed of in the correct bin...according to state regulations.\"). Essay A, also an experimental investigation, provides adequate safety precautions but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw. Overall, Essay A represents a competent investigation, but Essay B exemplifies a superior level of scientific inquiry, methodological development, and thoroughness.",
