  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions. Essay A's RQ, 'Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?' is slightly less specific than Essay B's, 'How do varying temperatures (15.0\u2103, 20.0\u2103, 25.0\u2103, 30.0\u2103, 35.0\u2103 \u00b1 0.5\u2103) affect the buffer capacity of pH-balancing facial cleansers...'. Essay B clearly outlines the independent variable with specific temperatures and includes the precision of the measurement, which is a stronger formulation. Both provide adequate background, but Essay B's is more comprehensive, covering the chemical principles of buffers in detail ('Buffers function through a dynamic equilibrium between the weak acid and its conjugate base'). The methodology in both is generally appropriate, outlining step-by-step procedures. However, Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of controlled variables, presenting them clearly in a table with justifications ('Controlled Variables | Possible Effects on Data | Methods of Control'), whereas Essay A only implicitly controls variables without explicitly stating them. In terms of safety and environmental considerations, Essay A's risk assessment is generic, mentioning 'appropriate PPE' without specifics and vaguely referring to chemical disposal 'according to school regulations'. In contrast, Essay B provides a more detailed risk assessment, specifying the hazards of HCl ('can cause severe burns') and the use of a fume hood for ammonia. Therefore, despite both being competent, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach to experimental design.",
