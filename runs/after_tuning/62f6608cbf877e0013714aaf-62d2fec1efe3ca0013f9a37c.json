  "reasoning": "Both submissions are strong examples of IB Chemistry internal assessments, demonstrating clear research questions, methodologies, and consideration for variables. However, Essay A is superior due to its more rigorous theoretical foundation and its direct and sophisticated link between theory and experimental design.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is well-focused. Its real strength lies in the background information, where it derives the integrated second-order rate law: \"$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int_{c_{0}}^{c} -\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} c=\\int_{0}^{t} k \\mathrm{~d} t \\\\ \\frac{1}{2-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{c^{2-1}}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}^{2-1}}\\right)=k t \\\\ \\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t \\end{aligned} $$\". This demonstrates a deep understanding of chemical kinetics and directly justifies the proposed method of plotting 1/c vs. t to find the rate constant, k. The methodology, involving quenching the reaction and titrating samples, is appropriate and robust for determining concentration changes over time. The identification and control of variables is thorough, including subtle points like the \"Drop rate of burette\".\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is also excellent. The background information correctly links catalyst strength (via pKa values) to activation energy via the Arrhenius equation. The variables are well-defined in a clear table. However, the methodology relies on a \"clock reaction\" where the dependent variable is \"time taken for mixture to become colourless,\" which is determined by the \"naked eye.\" This is inherently more subjective and less precise than the titration method used in Essay A. While a valid approach, it is less sophisticated. Furthermore, Essay B omits any mention of ethical considerations, whereas Essay A explicitly states, \"There were no notable ethical... issues,\" fulfilling all aspects of the criterion.\n\nIn conclusion, while both essays are well-structured, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor in its theoretical background, its connection of theory to the chosen methodology, and its more precise experimental design.",
