  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured investigations. However, Essay A is superior due to its clearer, more precise methodology and stronger justification for its experimental parameters.\n\n**Research Question:** Both essays provide focused and well-defined research questions. Essay A's question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is excellent. It clearly identifies the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (mass of iron(II)), and the method of measurement. Essay B's RQ, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration,\" is also good but slightly less concise.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Essay A provides concise and highly relevant background information, directly linking pH to iron solubility and explaining the titration chemistry involved. A key strength is the \"Justification of concentration of acidified KMnO\u2084 used,\" which demonstrates preliminary calculations and thoughtful experimental design. Its methodology is clear, logical, and easy to follow. In contrast, while Essay B's background is also good, its methodology contains a significant error. It repeatedly refers to using a \"Soxhlet apparatus\" for heating the oil samples. A Soxhlet apparatus is used for extraction, not for controlled heating to specific temperatures. This suggests a misunderstanding of the equipment, which undermines the credibility of the experimental design. Essay A\u2019s method is more robust and clearly described.\n\n**Variables & Control:** Both essays do an excellent job of identifying and justifying their independent, dependent, and controlled variables in clear tables. Essay A's reflection on changing from 5 pills to 1 pill based on preliminary work (\"I realised that the iron pills were taking too long to dissolve\") is a sign of a well-considered experimental design process.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays address these aspects thoroughly. Essay B's use of a table for safety issues is very clear and well-organized. However, the superior methodology and clearer scientific reasoning in Essay A outweigh this structural advantage.\n\nOverall, Essay A demonstrates a stronger grasp of experimental design and chemical principles. The methodological confusion in Essay B is a significant flaw that makes Essay A the better of the two.",
