  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of the Exploration criterion. Essay B's research question, \"how different oils with differing saturated fat contents affect the rate of the Maillard Reaction,\" is well-focused and supported by a thorough background section that links baking, the Maillard reaction, and colorimetric analysis. Its table of controlled variables is particularly commendable for its detail. However, Essay A's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\", is exemplary in its precision, clearly defining all variables, ranges, and uncertainties from the outset. Essay A also provides a more robust and specific safety assessment, detailing hazards and first aid for each chemical used, such as noting that manganese sulphate is \"Harmful if swallowed\" and sulfuric acid \"Causes severe skin burns.\" In contrast, Essay B's safety section is more generic, mentioning only general precautions like wearing \"Heat-proof gloves\" for the oven. While both methodologies are detailed and appropriate, the superior precision of the research question and the more comprehensive approach to safety in Essay A make it the stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
