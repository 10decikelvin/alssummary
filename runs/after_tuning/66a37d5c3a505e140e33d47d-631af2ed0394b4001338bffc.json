  "reasoning": "This was a close decision as both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B. However, Essay B is superior due to its significantly more in-depth and scientifically rigorous background information and its more complex research question.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is highly detailed and sets up a complex correlational study. The background section is exceptional, delving into the specific chemistry of casein micelles, complexation equilibria, and the role of phosphoserine residues in binding calcium, citing multiple scientific sources. This demonstrates a far deeper level of preliminary research and chemical understanding than Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B's identification of variables is more sophisticated, including a dedicated section for \"Uncontrolled variables\" like \"Fortification of milk products,\" which shows a high level of critical thinking about the experimental design.\n\nEssay A presents a very well-structured and competent investigation. Its research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\", is also excellent\u2014it is clear, focused, and specifies all necessary parameters.
