  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all core components of Criterion B, particularly in the quality of its research question, the depth of its background information, and the rigor of its experimental design.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly focused and detailed research question: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This question is excellent because it specifies the exact values and uncertainty of the independent variable and clearly defines how the dependent variable will be quantified. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources...\", is weaker. It fails to specify the range of NaCl concentrations and introduces a major uncontrolled variable (\"different water sources\"), which fundamentally undermines the focus of the investigation.\n\nSecond, Essay A's background is scientifically rigorous and directly relevant, linking the BZ reaction to reaction rate theory, collision theory, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to build a strong theoretical foundation. Essay B's background is more superficial; while it explains the Winkler method, it lacks depth on the chemical principles governing why salinity affects dissolved oxygen. Essay A\u2019s methodology is also more thoughtfully developed, featuring a \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that justifies the selection of a lux sensor over other options and explains procedural adaptations, demonstrating personal engagement. Essay B's methodology is confusingly structured and attempts a secondary investigation comparing two measurement techniques, which detracts from its primary research question.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide adequate safety, environmental, and ethical considerations for their experimental work, Essay A's approach is more commendable. It not only outlines specific chemical hazards and disposal methods (\"resulting solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\") but also shows proactive environmental consideration by reducing the scale of the experiment (\"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint\"). Essay B's S/E/E section is acceptable, but the fundamental flaws in its research question and experimental design make it a much weaker example of scientific exploration. The clarity, focus, and scientific depth of Essay A make it the clear winner.",
