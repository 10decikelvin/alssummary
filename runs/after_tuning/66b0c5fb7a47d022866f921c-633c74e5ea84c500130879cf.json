  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is substantially better than Essay B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its clear, focused, and well-defined research question: \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\". This singular focus allows for a logical and controlled experimental design. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is fundamentally flawed as it attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously, which is inappropriate for this level of investigation.\n\nThis foundational difference is reflected throughout the rest of the sections. Essay A provides a thorough and relevant background, including balanced chemical equations and a justification for the hypothesis based on chemical principles. Essay B's background is superficial and lacks specific chemical detail. Furthermore, Essay A's identification and control of variables is exemplary; the controlled variables are presented in a table detailing not only *what* will be controlled, but *why* and *how*. Essay B, on the other hand, poorly identifies its variables and provides a vague, minimal list of controlled variables, such as \"Boiling temperature,\" without explaining how this would be managed.\n\nFinally, as both are experimental investigations, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is critical. Essay A addresses all three aspects specifically, stating \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\" for its environmental plan and explicitly noting \"No ethical considerations were considered.\" Essay B provides only generic safety advice and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant failure in meeting the criteria. Overall, Essay A demonstrates a comprehensive and methodologically sound approach to scientific exploration, whereas Essay B is weak in its fundamental design and execution.",
