  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its greater depth of theoretical background, more sophisticated methodology, and more thorough engagement with the scientific process. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature... of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration measured by redox titration?\", is focused and detailed, specifying variables and the measurement technique. Its background on vitamin C and redox titration is relevant and its procedure is clear. However, Essay B's research question is exceptionally precise, defining the exact concentration ratios to be tested: \"[What is the effect of] the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity...\". Furthermore, Essay B's background demonstrates a much deeper understanding by not only explaining buffer theory but also justifying the selection of the experimental system: \"...the carbonic acid component of the buffer system wasn't able to be obtained... Thus, I decided to investigate the carbonate-bicarbonate buffer system instead...\". This shows advanced problem-solving before the experiment even began. Methodologically, Essay B also excels by including a \"Development of Methodology\" section, which credits an adapted university-level experiment and justifies the choice of variables. While both essays correctly identify variables and address safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations, Essay B's use of a formal risk assessment table and a more chemically-specific environmental point (\"NaOH is... corrosive... but the majority of it is neutralised through the experiment\") shows a higher level of polish. Essay A is a very competent investigation, but Essay B's comprehensive theoretical foundation and meticulous planning make it the stronger piece of work.",
