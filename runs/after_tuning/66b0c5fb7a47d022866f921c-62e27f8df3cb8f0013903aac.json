  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. The most significant differentiator is the quality and specificity of the research question. Essay B's RQ is exemplary: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This question precisely defines the reactants, their concentrations, the independent variable with its exact range, the dependent variable, and the specific measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's RQ, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is significantly more thorough and focused. It provides a detailed theoretical framework, explaining the reaction mechanism, rate laws, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly relevant to the investigation. Essay A's background is relevant but comparatively brief, only touching on the basic combustion reactions and the general trend of enthalpy with carbon chain length.\n\nBoth essays have appropriate methodologies and correctly identify variables. However, Essay B again shows greater depth by explicitly mentioning \"Preliminary Testing\" which was used to refine the procedure, such as setting the maximum temperature to 60\u00b0C because \"the reaction at 70\u00baC was too quick\". This demonstrates a more mature and iterative scientific process.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations in Essay B is far more comprehensive. It presents a detailed table outlining the specific hazards of each chemical used (e.g., \"Pure Propanone...Highly flammable,\" \"Sulfuric acid...Causes severe skin burns\") along with corresponding mitigation strategies. Essay A's safety section is generic, stating \"All lab safety equipment was worn at all times.\" While Essay A correctly addresses environmental disposal, Essay B's chemical-specific approach is of a higher quality.",
