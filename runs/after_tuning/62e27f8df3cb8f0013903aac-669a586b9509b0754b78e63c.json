  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed investigations that would likely score well in Criterion B. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific exploration and rigor.\n\n**Research Question & Background:** Essay A's research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\", is exceptionally specific and targets a more complex chemical concept (activation energy) than Essay B's question about the average rate of reaction. Essay A's background is superior as it directly supports this complex goal by thoroughly explaining the multi-step reaction mechanism, the specific rate law, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, which is crucial for the data analysis. Essay B's background is good, explaining neutralization and collision theory, but it is more general and less sophisticated than Essay A's.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Both essays excel in this area. They both provide clear, logical, and repeatable procedures. Both feature excellent tables for variables, detailing not just what is controlled, but why and how. Both also include a section on preliminary testing, which justifies their choice of variable ranges and procedural details, a hallmark of a well-planned investigation. For example, Essay A justifies its temperature range by noting, \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data,\" while Essay B explains its concentration range was chosen because \"the rate of reaction...was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution.\"\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays handle these aspects well. Essay A provides a comprehensive safety table detailing risks and mitigation for each chemical, stating for propanone, \"use acetone in a well-ventilated area, wear protective gloves and safety spectacles.\" It also addresses environmental concerns, such as \"Do not wash down the sink as that is an environmental hazard. Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay B is slightly more complete by explicitly addressing all three components, stating, \"This experiment has no ethical considerations,\" and detailing its waste minimization strategy and disposal method: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water.\" While Essay B is more thorough in this specific subsection, the omission of a single sentence on ethics in Essay A is a minor flaw.\n\n**Conclusion:** Essay A is the stronger submission. Its choice of a more demanding research question, supported by a more detailed and advanced theoretical background, demonstrates a deeper level of scientific inquiry and understanding. While Essay B is a very competent and well-executed investigation, Essay A's exploration of activation energy via the Arrhenius equation represents a more sophisticated and challenging experimental design.",
