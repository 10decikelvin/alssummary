  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and well-developed investigation plan. Its research question, 'How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...', is more sophisticated and clearly defines the range of the independent variable. The background information in Essay B is more comprehensive, providing chemical equations and a clear justification for the concentration of the titrant used. Furthermore, Essay B excels in its handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It provides specific safety precautions for chemicals like HCl, discusses the ethical aspect of minimizing waste ('only the required amount of chemicals were provided'), and gives precise instructions for environmental disposal ('Acidified KMnO4 should not be poured down the drain... but disposed into a sealable container'). In contrast, Essay A's research question is slightly less focused, referring vaguely to '5 processed orange juice brands'. While its methodology is adequate, it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant failing for an experimental investigation. Although Essay A does identify key variables, Essay B's justification for the chosen range of its independent variable shows a deeper level of planning and thought.",
