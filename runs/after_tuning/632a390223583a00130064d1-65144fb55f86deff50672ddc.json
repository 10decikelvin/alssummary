  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its greater depth in chemical theory and more critical evaluation of its own methodology.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, both are clear and focused. Essay A's RQ is strong: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". Essay B's RQ is exceptionally detailed and precise: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". Essay B's inclusion of specific ions, units, and the measurement technique within the RQ itself demonstrates a slightly higher level of planning and focus.\n\nSecond, regarding the background and methodology, both are well-structured. Essay A provides a solid background on polymers, plasticizers, and Young's Modulus. Its methodology is meticulously detailed, with clear tables for controlled and uncontrolled variables, and incorporates modern technology like the LabQuest 2 and Tracker software. However, Essay B's background information shows a more profound understanding of complex chemistry, explaining d-orbital splitting, the spectrochemical series, and specific ligand exchange reactions. This theoretical depth is more impressive. Furthermore, while both have sound methods, Essay B's student demonstrates superior critical thinking by identifying significant potential systematic errors in their evaluation, such as the fact that copper complexes favor a square planar geometry and that the iron and manganese ions might undergo oxidation rather than the intended ligand exchange, stating, \"it was found that the change in color from both metal complexes upon the addition of ammonium hydroxide is due to the oxidation of the metal under alkaline conditions... and was not a result of a ligand exchange reaction.\"\n\nFinally, both essays have excellent safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A is particularly commendable for addressing the ethics of using edible materials. Essay B appropriately identifies chemical hazards and correct disposal procedures for inorganic waste. While both are thorough, Essay B's deeper chemical insight, more precise research question, and more critical analysis of its experimental design's potential chemical flaws ultimately make it the stronger piece of work.",
