  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is a model of excellence, as it is focused, specific, and details both the range of the independent variable and the method of measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section is comprehensive and highly relevant, discussing the chemistry of bleach, the Beer-Lambert law, and even the preliminary titration required to determine the initial bleach concentration. This shows a deep engagement with the topic. Essay A's background is adequate but less detailed. The methodology of Essay B is also superior, featuring a well-justified pre-test to determine the optimal wavelength for the spectrophotometer. This demonstrates a thoughtful and scientifically rigorous approach to experimental design.\n\nEssay B's treatment of variables is more precise; it correctly identifies the reaction rate as the dependent variable and explains how it will be derived from absorbance data. Essay A imprecisely states the dependent variable is \"the temperature difference\" rather than the calculated specific heat capacity. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are exemplary, providing a detailed table of specific chemical hazards and clear, justified disposal methods. Essay A's considerations are present but much more generic, stating only that \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box.\" While Essay A presents a viable experiment, Essay B's planning, detail, and scientific depth are far more advanced.",
