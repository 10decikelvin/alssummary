  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across several key components of Criterion B. The primary differentiator is the quality and specificity of the research question. Essay B poses a highly focused and detailed question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". This question is exemplary because it precisely defines the independent variable's range, the dependent variable's measurement, and a key controlled variable (time). In contrast, Essay A's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this high level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, as an experimental investigation, Essay B excels in its methodology and consideration of practical issues. The methodology section provides a comprehensive apparatus list with uncertainties, a detailed, repeatable procedure, and exceptionally well-defined controlled variables with justifications. Most importantly, Essay B includes a thorough risk assessment. It addresses safety by identifying specific chemical hazards like \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive and viscous liquid\" and prescribing appropriate PPE. It also provides specific and responsible environmental disposal methods, such as neutralizing the acid and managing copper sulphate waste.\n\nEssay A is a competent data-based investigation. Its background is relevant, and the methodology of using established databases like NIST is appropriate for its research questions. The variables are correctly identified. As a data-based study, the omission of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is acceptable. However, it cannot match the depth and rigor demonstrated in Essay B's comprehensive experimental design and its meticulous attention to the full scope of Criterion B, especially in the formulation of the research question and the handling of safety and environmental protocols.",
