  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental explorations, but Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids...in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3...1.000mol dm^-3)...in 2 minutes?\", is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying all variables, quantities, and ranges within the question itself. Essay A's research question is also focused, but less self-contained. The standout feature of Essay B's exploration is its meticulous handling of all required components; it includes a \"Pre-test\" section to justify the chosen methodology and variable ranges, demonstrating a thoughtful design process. Most critically, Essay B provides a comprehensive section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, stating \"This experiment has no ethical considerations...\" and detailing waste disposal: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water.\" In contrast, Essay A, while presenting a more novel and complex investigation into the Maillard reaction, has a significant omission. It includes a basic \"Risk Assessment\" but completely fails to address any ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major weakness for a lab-based investigation. Therefore, although Essay A's topic is arguably more creative, Essay B's rigorous and complete fulfillment of the Criterion B requirements makes it the superior essay.",
