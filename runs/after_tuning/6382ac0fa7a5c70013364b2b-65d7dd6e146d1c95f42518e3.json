  "reasoning": "The research question in Essay A, 'What are the effects of caffeine on the heart rate of Daphnia magna,' is specific enough, though lacking extensive detail on conditions. The introduction adequately establishes the context of caffeine's widespread use. However, the procedure lacks important details such as a clear control group, multiple concentrations of caffeine, or a proper time frame for observation. Safety considerations are mentioned but are generic, lacking specific details about handling caffeine solutions. Ethical considerations about using Daphnia are present and appropriate. Environmental considerations are also mentioned. Essay B's research question, 'How does the duration of light exposure affect the rate of photosynthesis in Elodea canadensis?', is clear and focused. The background provides relevant information about photosynthesis. The procedure is well-structured, including a control and systematically varied light exposure times. The data collected (bubble count) is a reasonable measure for a basic experiment. The safety considerations are relevant to the equipment used. A potential weakness is that it lacks a strong conclusion connecting results back to the broader biological context. In conclusion, both have strengths and weaknesses. However, the methodological design of Experiment B is stronger as it includes a more robust experimental setup with a clearer control and manipulated variable, leading to a more reliable investigation. The lack of a strong conclusion in B is less detrimental than the foundational design flaws in A.",
