  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations. Essay B is superior due to its more thorough and well-justified experimental design and its complete fulfillment of the safety, ethical, and environmental requirements.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core investigative components, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is supported by an excellent justification for the chosen variable range. Essay B states, \"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia, it is logical to start with it... Having 6 different volumetric concentrations increasing by the same amount (20%) increases the validity and applicability of the data\". This contrasts with Essay A's justification for pH levels, which is less specific. Furthermore, Essay B's controlled variables table is more detailed and thoughtful, considering factors like the \"Source of E10\" because \"the percentage of ethanol present must be kept constant\".\n\nSecond, the methodology in Essay B is more robust. It includes a specific serial dilution plan (\"Each of the volumes were calculated using the formula C\u2081V\u2081=C\u2082V\u2082\") and provides clear quantitative instructions for the calorimetry process. Essay A's methodology is appropriate, but Essay B's shows a greater degree of planning and foresight, including thoughtful \"Assumptions made when calculating enthalpy change\".\n\nFinally, and most decisively, Essay B's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is comprehensive, whereas Essay A has significant omissions. Essay B explicitly addresses all three points under its \"Risk Assessment\" section. For environmental considerations, it provides a specific and responsible disposal plan: \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company.\" For ethics, it correctly states, \"No ethical considerations were considered.\" Essay A, in contrast, completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, a clear flaw. Its environmental consideration is also weak, stating that waste was \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory,\" which is vague and likely inappropriate for the chemical reagents used. While both essays have good safety sections, Essay B's is slightly better for specifying the use of a \"ventilated fume cupboard\".\n\nIn summary, while Essay A presents a competent investigation, Essay B excels with a more deeply considered experimental design, stronger justifications, and a complete, specific, and appropriate risk assessment, making it the better submission for Criterion B.",
