  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations for an experimental investigation. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\", is excellent, clearly defining the scope, variables, and measurement technique. Similarly, Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is also highly focused and detailed. Both essays provide relevant background information, appropriate methodologies, and well-justified controlled variables.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a greater depth of understanding and thoroughness. Its background research is more comprehensive, referencing Faraday's law and citing previous studies (e.g., \"Aygar, A. M. (2009) reported that the mass difference...significantly increases as the voltage increases\"). While Essay A's background on Vitamin C is good, Essay B's integration of prior research elevates its quality. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology includes a detailed table of apparatus with specific uncertainties, such as \"Weighing scale | \u00b10.1g\", which demonstrates a more rigorous approach to experimental design.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A addresses these adequately, noting risks from the \"heating plate\" and iodine. In contrast, Essay B's consideration is exemplary. It specifically identifies the high corrosivity of Sulphuric acid (\"can cause rapid tissue destruction or serious chemical burns\") and then provides an outstanding environmental section. Instead of a general statement, it acknowledges that \"Copper sulphate is a pesticide...harmful to the environment and aquatic life\" and proposes multiple, specific disposal methods, such as neutralizing acid with sodium carbonate or mixing copper sulphate with \"saw dust which can be disposed of as solid waste.\" This level of specific, practical detail is far superior and demonstrates a much deeper engagement with the implications of the experimental work.",
