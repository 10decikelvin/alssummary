  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions and follow a standard scientific format, but Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design and scientific rigor. Essay A's RQ, 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?', is clear. However, its method is simplistic and lacks control over variables like heat loss, which it acknowledges as a significant limitation ('The experimental values of the enthalpies of combustion would be lower than the actual values...'). Essay B's RQ, 'Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions: Ag+, Br\u2212, Cl\u2212 and I\u2212 from enthalpy changes of precipitation reaction for: A g C l , A g I , A g B r and dissolution process of soluble salts of these ions?', is more ambitious and well-defined. While the student ultimately concludes their experimental setup was inadequate ('The change in temperature, the jump, was too small to continue further calculations.'), their detailed procedure, consideration of specific safety measures ('wear...goggles', 'store [silver nitrate] away from flammable materials'), and thorough exploration of potential error sources (like the lack of a proper calorimeter) showcase a superior understanding of the scientific process. Essay A's safety precautions are generic ('wear safety goggles'), and its experimental design is less controlled. Therefore, despite the inconclusive results, Essay B is the better submission due to its more complex research question, thorough methodology, and deeper engagement with potential sources of error.",
