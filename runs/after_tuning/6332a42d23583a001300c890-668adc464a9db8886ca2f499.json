  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of planning and scientific inquiry in its exploration. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying the exact concentrations to be tested and the precise measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, while focused, is less specific. Essay B's methodology is also more sophisticated; the inclusion of a \"Pre-Test\" to determine the unknown concentration of commercial bleach via titration and to find the peak absorbance wavelength shows a high degree of independent thought and preparation. This contrasts with Essay A's reliance on visual color change, a more subjective measurement. Furthermore, Essay B's discussion of controlled variables is more thorough, as it not only lists them but also explains their significance in a table, for example, \"Since the dependent variable of this experiment is the reaction rate, temperature must remain constant as the temperature of the solvent affects the collision of molecules which in turn affects the reaction rate.\" While Essay A provides a solid background and a clear procedure, Essay B's approach feels more rigorous and demonstrative of a higher level of scientific engagement. Both essays handle safety and environmental considerations well, but Essay B's more detailed experimental design and justification give it a clear edge.",
