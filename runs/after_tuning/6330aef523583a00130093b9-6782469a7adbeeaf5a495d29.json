  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A for Criterion B. The most significant differentiator is the identification and control of variables. Essay B correctly identifies its independent variable as \"[H2O2] would be varied 5 times at concentrations of 1.765 mmol dm\u207b\u00b3...\" and its dependent variable as the \"initial rate of reaction\" derived from absorbance changes. In stark contrast, Essay A fundamentally misidentifies its variables, stating the dependent variable is \"Different types of substances dissolved...\" and the independent variable is \"Temperature change...\", which is incorrect; the temperature change is the dependent variable. This error reveals a critical misunderstanding of experimental design in Essay A.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's research question is far more focused and detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction... in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This specificity, including the method, conditions, and concentration range, is exemplary. Essay A's question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...\", is clear but lacks the same level of scientific rigor and specificity.\n\nEssay B also excels in its background research and methodological planning. It provides a strong rationale by discussing the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2\", which directly justifies its chosen concentration range. The inclusion of \"Preliminary Trials\" to refine the procedure demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to the investigation. While Essay A's background is relevant, it is more general and lacks this level of specific research-informed planning. Finally, Essay B provides more thorough environmental considerations, stating that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC,\" which is more robust than Essay A's brief mention of a \"designated container.\"",
