  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across multiple key aspects of Criterion B. The primary reason for this decision is the appropriateness and complexity of the methodology in relation to the research question. Essay A's methodology is not only suitable but also well-justified and shows a high degree of student engagement. For instance, Essay A's procedure involves two distinct titrations, one with reflux, to determine both Acid Value and Saponification Value, and it provides a \"Justification for methodology\" section that explains choices like temperature range and chemical concentrations. In stark contrast, Essay B's methodology contains a fundamental chemical flaw, which the student themselves identifies in their evaluation: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This means the chosen method (a simple acid-base titration) is incapable of answering the research question, as it measures total acidity, not the specific concentration of ascorbic acid.\n\nSecondly, Essay A provides a far more comprehensive and specific treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is critical for an experimental investigation. Essay A presents a detailed table with five specific risks, such as \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"While reflux, there are chances of bursting of flask,\" accompanied by specific precautions. It also explicitly addresses ethical considerations regarding resource use (\"it was not either wasted or used in excess\") and environmental impact, noting that chemicals \"were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\" Essay B's coverage is critically lacking; its safety section is minimal, stating only that \"Gloves are not necessary... due to the usage of a low-concentrated... NaOH,\" and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations.\n\nFinally, while both essays have clear and focused research questions, Essay A's investigation into the effect of a continuous variable (\"effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures\") allows for a more sophisticated analysis than Essay B's comparison of a categorical variable (\"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands\"). The background information in Essay A is also more chemically rigorous and focused on the principles of the investigation (hydrolysis, saponification) compared to Essay B's background, which spends significant time on health benefits rather than the chemical underpinnings of the titration. Although Essay B correctly identifies controlled variables, its flawed methodology and failure to address key S/E/E aspects make it a much weaker submission.",
