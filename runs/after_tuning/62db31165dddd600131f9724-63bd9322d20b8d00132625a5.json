  "reasoning": "Both essays provide a reasonable attempt at fulfilling the criteria, but Essay A is slightly stronger overall due to a more focused research question and a more detailed methodology.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"What is the Relationship Between Temperature on Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Concentration in Lemon Juice?\", is clear and focused. The background information provided is relevant, explaining the role of Vitamin C and the chemical process of oxidation that will be measured. The methodology, though not explicitly provided in the excerpt, is implied to be a titration using an iodine solution, which is an appropriate method for determining Vitamin C concentration. The identification of variables is missing from the provided text, which is a weakness. However, the brief mention of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, while not detailed, shows an awareness of these aspects.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", is also clear. The background information is partially provided through the context of the results, discussing the expected differences in enthalpy. The methodology is present but incomplete in the excerpt. A significant strength of Essay B is its detailed 'Strengths and Limitations' table, which critically evaluates the experimental procedure and suggests improvements. This demonstrates a higher level of reflection than Essay A. The safety considerations are also more specific (\"Ensure that there is no close contact with the flame...\"). However, the provided text lacks a clear, upfront description of the variables and a complete methodology, which are crucial components of the investigation's design. The results presented in the graph show a significant discrepancy from literature values, which, while acknowledged, points to potential issues in the experimental design or execution not fully captured in the provided text.\n\nComparing the two, Essay A presents a more complete picture of the experimental plan from the outset, with a clear link between the background theory and the chosen methodology. Although it lacks a detailed variables table in the excerpt provided, the question is well-defined. Essay B, while showing strong evaluation skills, is less clear in its initial setup in the provided text. Therefore, Essay A is marginally better structured and more focused in its research question and background.",
