  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much deeper and more thorough engagement with all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is highly focused and specific, framing the investigation as an exploration of a relationship. In contrast, Essay A's research question is more of a title: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\". Furthermore, Essay B's background information is directly focused on the principles of heterogeneous catalysis and active sites, which is central to its investigation. Essay A's background is more general and contains a significant factual error, incorrectly stating that \"Caffeine also has four hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to the xanthine ring.\"\n\nMethodologically, Essay B shows a higher level of critical thinking in its experimental design and variable control. For example, it attempts to control the catalyst's surface area by specifying the grinding method: \"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of factors affecting reaction rates. Essay A's controlled variables, while present, are less sophisticated (e.g., \"Poke exactly 32 holes around the top of the foil\").\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this section. Essay B excels by explicitly addressing all three components with specific details. It discusses safety for both chemicals, states that \"there are no evident ethical considerations,\" and provides a clear environmental plan: \"Manganese dioxide catalyst... [was] collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\". Essay A addresses safety precautions for dichloromethane but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for an investigation using a hazardous chlorinated solvent. Overall, Essay B presents a more scientifically rigorous, thoughtful, and complete exploration.",
