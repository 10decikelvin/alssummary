  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its significantly higher level of scientific rigor, depth, and precision across all key elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirstly, Essay A presents a more sophisticated and specific research question: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This is far more detailed than Essay B's \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...reacting with blue food colouring...\". Essay A's question targets specific kinetic parameters (pseudo-order and order) and defines the exact concentration range, showing a clear, focused investigative goal from the outset.\n\nSecondly, the background information in Essay A is exemplary. It establishes a strong real-world context (dye pollution), delves into the specific chemical mechanism (Photo-Fenton reaction), explains advanced concepts like the \"Scavenging Effect,\" and explicitly identifies a research gap it aims to address: \"There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts.\" In contrast, Essay B's background is more superficial, relying on a personal anecdote about nosebleeds and providing a more basic overview of kinetics.\n\nThirdly, Essay A's methodology is more robust and thoughtfully designed. It justifies the choice of H2O2 concentrations based on literature to avoid the scavenging effect, a critical detail missing from Essay B. Essay A also describes informative preliminary trials that led to crucial adjustments: \"during preliminary trials, it was observed that there was a major change between the first reading at t=0 and the second reading at t=15...Hence, aliquots were subsequently pipetted out every 4 minutes\". This demonstrates a genuine investigative process. Essay B's methodology is adequate but less rigorous; for example, its control variables table contains a contradiction, stating the volume of bleach is \"1.5cm\u00b3\" while the procedure describes preparing samples by diluting \"9 cm\u00b3 of commercial bleach\".\n\nFinally, while Essay B has a more detailed safety table, Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental section is sufficient and integrated well. Essay A mentions specific hazards and precautions (\"googles were worn when the UV-Lamp was in operation to prevent eye damage\") and appropriate disposal (\"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\"). The superior scientific depth of Essay A's research question, background, and methodology far outweighs the more detailed format of Essay B's safety section.",
