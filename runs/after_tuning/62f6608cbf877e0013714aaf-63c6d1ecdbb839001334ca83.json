  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of a well-planned investigation. However, Essay B demonstrates a slightly superior level of detail and engagement with the scientific process. Its research question is highly specific, stating not just the variables but also the exact range to be tested and the method of measurement: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted...via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\". Essay A's question is good but less detailed. Essay B's background information is excellent, linking the chemistry to a real-world context (anemia), providing the relevant chemical equations, and justifying the concentration of the titrant used. While Essay A also provides a solid theoretical background, including the Arrhenius equation, Essay B's inclusion of a justification calculation shows a deeper level of preparatory work. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology section mentions adapting the experimental design based on preliminary trials, which is a hallmark of excellent scientific practice. Finally, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental section is more comprehensive, correctly identifying KMnO4 as toxic and requiring specific disposal, whereas Essay A suggests a less ideal disposal method for its reagents.",
