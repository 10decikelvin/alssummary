  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The fundamental strength of Essay A begins with its research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact values of the independent variable and the concentrations of reactants. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity regarding the range of concentrations to be tested.\n\nThis initial strength in Essay A is supported by a deeply informed background section that connects the investigation to advanced concepts like Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Le Chatelier's principle, demonstrating a sophisticated theoretical grasp. Essay B's background is relevant but far more simplistic. Methodologically, Essay A presents a robust, two-part experiment including the creation of a calibration curve and discusses preliminary trials, which indicates thorough planning. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only listing variables but also explaining precisely why and how they must be controlled. Essay B's methodology oversimplifies the physics by assuming `E=Pt=Q`, which fails to account for inevitable heat loss to the surroundings and calorimeter, a significant systematic error.\n\nFinally, Essay A's treatment of safety and environmental considerations is specific and detailed. It identifies particular chemical hazards, stating, \"Potassium thiocyanate... Contact with acids liberates toxic gas,\" and provides explicit disposal advice: \"...iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\" Essay B's safety section is generic (\"Wear rubber gloves\"), and its environmental plan is vague (\"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\"). While both are experimental investigations requiring these sections, Essay A's execution is far more rigorous and scientifically sound, making it the clear winner.",
