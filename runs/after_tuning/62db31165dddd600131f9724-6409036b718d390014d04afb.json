  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality across all elements of Criterion B. Firstly, its research question is significantly more detailed and focused. Essay B asks: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This specifies the exact independent variable values with uncertainty and clearly defines how the dependent variable will be measured. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity.\n\nSecondly, Essay B's background information and methodological planning are far more sophisticated and demonstrate deeper engagement. It not only explains the underlying redox chemistry but also delves into the complex mechanism of oscillating reactions and justifies the choice of measurement equipment through a thoughtful \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, detailing a trial-and-error process. Essay A provides relevant but standard background on vitamin C oxidation and titration. Furthermore, Essay B's variable control is exemplary, presented in a table that provides the \"Reason for Controlling\" and \"Method of Control\" for seven different variables, a level of detail entirely absent from Essay A's incomplete table.\n\nFinally, and most critically for an experimental investigation, Essay B includes a thorough and specific section on \"Safety, Environmental and Ethical Considerations.\" It identifies specific hazards for key chemicals like \"Potassium bromate... may cause fire or explosion, is a strong oxidizer, toxic if swallowed\" and outlines mitigation strategies. It also thoughtfully addresses environmental impact by stating, \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw that makes its exploration fundamentally incomplete and unsafe. Due to its superior research question, depth of background, rigorous methodology, and comprehensive safety analysis, Essay B is the clear winner.",
