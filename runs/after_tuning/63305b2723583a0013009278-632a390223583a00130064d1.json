  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations, but Essay A is superior in its methodology and control of variables. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is specific and details the exact independent variable values to be tested. The background information directly explains electroplating theory and Faraday's Laws, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the hypothesis. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also well-defined. However, its methodology has significant uncontrolled variables that undermine the reliability of its results. Essay B correctly identifies \"Uniform Thickness of the Plastics\" and \"Rate of Water Evaporation from Plastic\" as uncontrolled variables, noting that inconsistencies could lead to \"premature ripping\" and affect the plastic's properties. Essay A, while not perfect, demonstrates better control over its variables, for example by combining solutions to \"ensure that the concentration of electrolyte is the same in all of the trials\". Essay A also provides more specific safety precautions, stating, \"Gloves were worn...risk of minor electrocution...skin irritation...well-ventilated space...fumes of zinc sulphate heptahydrate may cause respiratory irritation.\" Essay B's safety points are more generic, such as \"Handling of glass\" and \"Working with hot solutions\". While both essays address environmental considerations, Essay A's experimental control is more robust, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
