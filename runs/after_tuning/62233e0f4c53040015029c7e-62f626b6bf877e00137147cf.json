  "reasoning": "Essay A is better because it demonstrates a much stronger scientific foundation for its investigation, which is the core of Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in its detailed background information and clear identification of variables. The background section successfully connects the core concepts of buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and the temperature dependence of pKa, stating \"pKa is not constant towards the temperature change and as the temperature increases, the value of pKa slightly decreases... therefore the pH is temperature-dependent.\" This provides a solid theoretical basis for the research question. Furthermore, Essay A excels in its methodology by explicitly defining its independent, dependent, and controlled variables in detailed tables, explaining not only how they will be controlled but also their significance.\n\nEssay B, while having a well-phrased research question (\"...how significant is the variation in calcium content...\"), suffers from critical foundational weaknesses. The provided text contains virtually no background information explaining the principles of complexometric titration, the chemistry of EDTA, or the scientific reason why calcium content might change with a milk's expiration date. It also completely fails to identify and list its variables, a fundamental component of experimental design. While Essay B's risk assessment is significantly more thorough and specific than Essay A's, citing multiple chemical hazards and mitigations like \"Ammonium chloride buffer should be opened and put into a fume cupboard,\" this strength cannot compensate for the lack of scientific context and poor methodological planning. Essay A's safety section is weak and incomplete, stating a hazard for acetic acid but failing to provide a minimization strategy, and it omits environmental considerations entirely, which is a notable flaw. However, as per IB assessment principles, a well-conceived and justified investigation (Essay A) is superior to one with a poor scientific foundation (Essay B), even if the latter has a better safety section.",
