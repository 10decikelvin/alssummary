  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially stronger across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused and clearly leads to a scientific investigation. It supports this with a comprehensive background that correctly derives the second-order integrated rate law and links it to the Arrhenius equation, providing a robust theoretical foundation for the experiment. In contrast, Essay A's research question, while present, is less specific as it fails to define the range or intervals for the \"expiration date.\" More significantly, Essay A's background section is critically insufficient, containing only a single generic definition: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry...\".\n\nMethodologically, Essay B excels by explicitly defining the independent, dependent, and multiple controlled variables with clear justifications for each. Its procedure is logical and directly linked to the theory established in its background. Essay A, however, provides a list of procedural steps but fails to formally identify any variables, which is a major flaw in experimental design. Furthermore, while both essays are experimental, Essay B demonstrates a more complete consideration of relevant factors by addressing safety (\"sodium hydroxide is corrosive, gloves were worn\"), ethics (\"There were no notable ethical... issues\"), and environment (\"ethyl acetate was flushed down the sink with large quantities of water\"). Essay A provides a solid risk assessment but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, making its exploration less complete.",
