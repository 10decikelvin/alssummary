  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior because it demonstrates a more thorough and well-considered approach to the investigation. While both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is more focused and detailed by including the specific range of the independent variable and a key controlled variable (time). The methodology in Essay B is also more robustly presented, with a clear, step-by-step procedure. Most significantly, Essay B excels in its handling of safety and environmental considerations. It explicitly identifies hazards such as \"skin irritation\" and \"respiratory irritation\" from specific chemicals and outlines preventative measures like wearing gloves and ensuring ventilation. Furthermore, it addresses the environmental impact, noting that \"Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic to aquatic organisms\" and explaining the proper disposal of both chemical waste and batteries. In contrast, Essay A's safety section is minimal and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant weakness for an experimental investigation.",
