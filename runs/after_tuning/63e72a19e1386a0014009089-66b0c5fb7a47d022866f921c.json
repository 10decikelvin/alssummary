  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured investigations. Essay A features a meticulously detailed research question: \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\", which is a key strength. However, its safety section is incomplete, mentioning only manganese sulphate while omitting other key reagents like concentrated sulphuric acid, and it completely fails to address environmental or ethical considerations. Essay B, while having a slightly less detailed research question, excels in its overall methodology and risk assessment. The author provides a strong justification for the chosen concentrations and explicitly states the assumptions made in the experiment. Crucially, Essay B contains a comprehensive \"Risk Assessment\" section that addresses safety (\"All lab safety equipment was worn... All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\"), environmental concerns (\"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\"), and ethical considerations (\"No ethical considerations were considered\"). This thorough approach to the practical and safety aspects of the investigation demonstrates a superior level of planning and awareness, making Essay B the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
