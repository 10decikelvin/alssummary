  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused research question, deep integration of chemical theory into its methodology, and meticulous experimental design. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is specific and uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\"), setting a clear direction for analysis. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen... from different water sources...\", is less focused by attempting to investigate multiple water sources at once and lacks specificity regarding the range of concentrations.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its development of a sophisticated methodology grounded in strong background research. It identifies a potential problem (a colorless solution unsuited for spectrometry) and provides a well-researched solution by forming a colored copper(II) complex, explaining the underlying crystal field theory. It then documents pilot studies to solve a subsequent precipitation issue, justifying the use of Crystal Violet and SDS to form micelles: \"the amount of precipitate formed was significantly reduced when Methyl violet was used... Therefore, Crystal violet was chosen for this investigation\". This demonstrates a high level of personal engagement and scientific problem-solving. Essay A's methodology is appropriate but lacks this depth and contains a critical omission: it fails to state the specific concentrations of NaCl that will be tested.\n\nWhile both essays provide strong safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay B's foundational elements\u2014the research question, background, and methodology\u2014are of a much higher quality. Essay B explicitly lists the temperatures to be tested in its variables section (\"19.6\u00b0C, 30.1\u00b0C, 40.2\u00b0C, 49.9\u00b0C, 61.7\u00b0C\") and provides a detailed, replicable procedure. Essay A's procedure is less rigorous due to the missing independent variable range, a significant flaw in experimental design. Therefore, Essay B's comprehensive and well-justified exploration makes it the better essay.",
