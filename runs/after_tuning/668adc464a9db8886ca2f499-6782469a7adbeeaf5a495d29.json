  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong explorations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and complexity.\n\n**Research Question & Background:** Essay B's research question is more ambitious and specific: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This is superior to Essay A's, which, while clear, is more standard (\"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...\"). Essay B's background is also more sophisticated, providing excellent context on industrial pollution and identifying a specific research gap: \"There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts.\" It also discusses advanced concepts like the \"Scavenging Effect,\" which shows deeper research. Essay A's background is solid and appropriately explains the Beer-Lambert law and the necessary titration chemistry, but it lacks the depth and contextualization of Essay B.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Both essays have excellent methodologies that are appropriate for their research questions, including crucial preliminary testing. Essay A's pre-test to determine the concentration of commercial bleach via titration is a strong point. Essay B's preliminary trials to optimize concentrations and timings are equally commendable. Both have well-defined and justified controlled variables.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, & Environmental Considerations:** Both essays are experimental. Essay A's approach here is superior. It provides a detailed safety table with specific hazards and emergency actions for each chemical (\"If it gets on skin or hair, rinse the contaminated areas with water.\"). Its environmental section is also more specific about disposal: \"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay B handles this more briefly in a single paragraph, stating that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC,\" which is less descriptive. Neither essay explicitly mentions ethical considerations, which is a minor omission for both.\n\n**Conclusion:** While Essay A is methodologically very sound and presents its safety and environmental considerations more thoroughly, Essay B's superior research question, deeper background research, and stronger justification for the investigation's significance give it the edge. The level of chemical understanding demonstrated in Essay B, particularly regarding the Photo-Fenton reaction mechanism and potential side reactions, is more impressive and aligns better with the highest marks for Criterion B.",
