  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher quality of exploration (Criterion B) compared to Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is superior because it is highly specific, detailing the exact concentrations of the independent variable. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is exceptionally thorough and reproducible. The variables section is a model of excellence, presenting controlled variables in a table that not only explains *how* they will be controlled but also *why* it is important (\"Possible Effect on Results\"). It also thoughtfully includes a section on uncontrolled variables, demonstrating a deep understanding of the experimental limitations. Essay B's methodology is critically flawed as it fails to specify the different masses of KNO\u2083 that will be used, stating only to \"Repeat step 1 up to 10 for the remaining masses of KNO3.\" This makes the experiment impossible to replicate as written.\n\nFinally, Essay A's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is more comprehensive and nuanced. It provides specific safety measures for handling hot glass and solutions. It also includes a thoughtful ethical consideration regarding the \"Use of edible materials\" and a specific environmental plan for the \"Disposal of bioplastics\" by composting. Essay B's considerations are much more generic; for instance, the environmental plan is simply \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician,\" which lacks any specific detail about the nature of the waste or its proper disposal method. Overall, Essay A presents a more focused, well-planned, and critically considered investigation.",
