  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and viable investigations. Essay B has a slightly more focused and detailed research question, explicitly stating the range and uncertainty of the independent variable: \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm\u00b3 of tap water?\". It also provides a stronger justification for controlling variables. However, Essay A is superior overall because it demonstrates a more complete understanding of the experimental process, particularly concerning safety and environmental impact. Essay A provides specific chemical disposal instructions: \"The iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste and the propanone solution should be disposed of in the organic waste.\" In contrast, Essay B, despite having a detailed safety section, completely omits any mention of chemical disposal, which is a key component of the environmental considerations for a lab-based investigation. Furthermore, Essay A's self-evaluation, which identifies a potential flaw in its temperature control methodology, shows a higher level of critical reflection. Therefore, despite the strengths of Essay B's introduction and variable table, Essay A's more comprehensive approach to the practical and ethical aspects of the investigation makes it the better of the two.",
