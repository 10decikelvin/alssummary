  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it exhibits a higher level of detail, specificity, and personal engagement across all aspects of Criterion B. The foundation of an investigation is its research question, and Essay B's is a model of clarity and focus: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This RQ specifies the exact independent variable values and defines how the dependent variable will be quantified. In contrast, Essay A's RQ, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate?\", is a less focused yes/no question that lacks this critical specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section includes a detailed rationale for its methodological choices under \"Choice of Materials and Method,\" explaining the process of selecting a lux sensor over visual observation or a colorimeter. This demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough exploratory process. Essay A's background is relevant but lacks this depth of personal investigation into the method's design. Essay B also excels in its treatment of variables, presenting them in a clear table that not only identifies the controlled variables but also provides a rationale for their control and the specific method of control, such as for \"Ambient light\": \"The experiment will be done in the fume cupboard with artificial light, and the rest of the lab will be blacked out.\"\n\nFinally, both are experimental investigations requiring full safety and environmental considerations, and Essay B is far more rigorous. Essay B lists specific hazards for each chemical (\"Potassium bromate... toxic if swallowed, and may cause cancer\") and details concrete mitigation strategies (\"nitrile gloves, goggles, and a lab coat were worn... experiment is performed in the fume cupboard\"). Essay A's primary safety measure is the generic and insufficient statement to use \"Very careful operations during the experiment...\". Environmentally, Essay B also shows superior engagement by not only detailing disposal but also by actively reducing its impact: \"...the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" While Essay A is a competent investigation, Essay B consistently demonstrates a higher standard of scientific inquiry and documentation.",
