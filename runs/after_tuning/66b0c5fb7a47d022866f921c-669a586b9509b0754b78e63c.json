  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better than Essay A for Criterion B. The primary reason is the exceptional quality and specificity of its research question, which sets a strong foundation for the entire investigation. Essay B's RQ, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\", is a model of clarity and detail, specifying all key parameters. In contrast, Essay A's RQ, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear but lacks this high level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B showcases a more thorough and authentic exploration process. The author explicitly discusses refining their initial idea, stating \"the CO\u2082 produced at higher pH conditions was so small, it could not be measured with the tools available... I decided to measure the rate of reaction in different (and higher) concentrations of HCl.\" This demonstrates personal engagement and critical thinking. The inclusion of a formal \"Pre-test\" section to justify the chosen concentrations and time frame is a significant strength not present in Essay A.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify variables and outline appropriate methodologies, Essay B's treatment is more rigorous. It identifies a wider range of controlled variables, including \"Stirring of the solution\" and \"Surface area of crushed antacid,\" with specific control methods. Essay A's definition of the dependent variable as \"The total mass of the fuel burnt\" is also less precise than Essay B's, as it is an intermediate measurement used to calculate the actual variable of interest, the enthalpy of combustion.\n\nFinally, while both essays fulfill the requirements for safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay B's approach is superior. It presents safety information in a detailed table, outlining specific hazards for each chemical (e.g., HCl \"Can cause severe skin burns, eye damage\") and corresponding emergency actions, which is far more comprehensive than Essay A's general safety paragraph. Although Essay A is a competent and complete investigation, Essay B excels in its focused research question, demonstrated methodological refinement, and overall depth of exploration.",
