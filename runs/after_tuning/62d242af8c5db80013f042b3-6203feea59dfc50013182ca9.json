  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and viable investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of detail and thoroughness in its experimental design, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk... is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using... (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". This clearly outlines the independent variable with precise values, the dependent variable, and the exact analytical method. Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is also strong but slightly less precise with its independent variable ranges being defined later. Essay A further strengthens its background by including a \"Comparison of Method\" section, justifying its choice of titration over other techniques, which shows deeper research.\n\nBoth essays have detailed methodologies and variable tables. Essay A's table of controlled variables is particularly comprehensive, listing nine distinct factors with clear methods of control. While Essay B's controlled variables are appropriate, Essay A's list is more exhaustive. Crucially, Essay A addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It explicitly states, \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved in the experiment,\" which is the correct way to address this criterion for such an investigation. In contrast, Essay B completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a significant oversight. While Essay B's safety table is well-integrated, Essay A's safety precautions are equally specific and robust. Essay A's inclusion of a detailed limitations table, which critically evaluates potential errors in the proposed methodology, further showcases a superior level of planning and foresight.",
