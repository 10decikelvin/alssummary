  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key components of Criterion B.\n\nFirstly, Essay A presents a significantly more focused and detailed research question: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\" This question specifies the independent variable with its exact levels, the dependent variable with units, and the precise analytical method. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity regarding the concentration range.\n\nSecondly, the methodology and control of variables in Essay A are far more thorough. Essay A provides a comprehensive table of controlled variables, explaining not only *what* will be controlled (e.g., \"Concentration of EDTA solution (0.05moldm\u207b\u00b3)\") but also *how* it will be controlled and *why* it is important. Essay B's list of controlled variables is much smaller and the justifications are less developed. Furthermore, Essay A's procedure is detailed and replicable, whereas Essay B's procedure is vague about the specific masses of KNO\u2083 to be used, stating only \"Repeat step 1 up to 10 for the remaining masses of KNO3\".\n\nFinally, Essay A's treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is more specific and robust. It identifies particular chemical hazards, stating \"ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive hence exposure to high concentrations of ammonia gas will cause inflammation,\" and prescribes specific precautions like using a \"fume cupboard.\" Its environmental note on minimizing \"food wastage\" is also a relevant consideration. Essay B's safety points are more generic (e.g., \"Wearing safety goggles\"), and its environmental statement, \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box,\" is minimal and lacks detail. While both essays are experimental, Essay A demonstrates a much higher level of planning, foresight, and chemical understanding.",
