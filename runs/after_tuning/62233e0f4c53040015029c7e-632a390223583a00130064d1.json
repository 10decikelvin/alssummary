  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is exemplary in its clarity and specificity, immediately defining the independent variable with its precise ranges and the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is clear but less detailed, requiring the reader to look elsewhere for the specific temperatures being tested.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is meticulously detailed, logically sequenced, and incorporates modern technology like \"Vernier LabQuest 2\" and \"Tracker Software\" to enhance accuracy. Its handling of variables is sophisticated, not only detailing controlled variables with justifications but also thoughtfully identifying uncontrolled variables like \"Uniform Depth of Sample\". Essay A's methodology is confusingly structured and less detailed. While Essay A correctly identifies its variables, the depth of control is less rigorous than in Essay B.\n\nThe most critical difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this section. Essay B provides an outstanding \"Risk Assessment\" table that thoroughly and specifically addresses safety (\"Handling of glass\", \"Working with hot solutions\"), environmental impact (\"Disposal of bioplastics...they should be compostable\"), and even ethical concerns (\"Use of edible materials\"). Essay A's safety section is incomplete, mentioning only \"Acetic acid\", and completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental factors, which is a major failing for Criterion B in an experimental context.",
