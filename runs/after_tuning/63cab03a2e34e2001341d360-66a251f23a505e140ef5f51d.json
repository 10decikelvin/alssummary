  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The foundational strength of Essay B lies in its research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This question is highly specific, detailing the exact temperatures for the independent variable and the concentrations of the reactants. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level...?\", is less focused as \"pollution level\" is a qualitative descriptor rather than a controlled, quantifiable variable.\n\nEssay B's background section provides a deep, relevant theoretical foundation, linking the experiment to core chemical principles like \"Gibbs free energy change, \u0394G\", \"Van't Hoff's equation\", and \"Le Chatelier's Principle\". The inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" to justify methodological choices is a mark of high-quality exploration. Essay A's background is adequate but less focused, discussing broad international agreements before narrowing in on the chosen water bodies. While Essay A appropriately outlines the chemistry of the Winkler method, Essay B's theoretical integration is far more sophisticated.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B excels in its treatment of variables. It presents a detailed table of controlled variables that not only lists them but explains *why* and *how* each is controlled, a critical aspect of experimental design. Essay A correctly identifies its variables but provides no such justification. Furthermore, both are experimental investigations, requiring full consideration of safety, ethics, and the environment. Essay B addresses all three components explicitly. Its environmental section is specific, stating that waste chemicals \"need to be neutralised\" before disposal. Essay A has a strong risk assessment for its chemicals but omits any mention of ethics and provides only a generic environmental statement: \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals\". This omission and lack of specificity make it significantly weaker than Essay B in this regard.",
