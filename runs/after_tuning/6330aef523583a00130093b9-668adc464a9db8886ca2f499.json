  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all facets of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the quality of the research question and the identification of variables. Essay B presents a focused, measurable, and detailed research question: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". This RQ clearly specifies the independent variable (bleach concentration, including the range) and dependent variable (reaction rate), and names the specific technique used for measurement (spectrophotometer). In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\", is a closed yes/no question which is weak in design, though it does specify the chemicals involved.\n\nThis initial strength in Essay B is reinforced by its correct and thorough handling of variables. It correctly identifies the independent variable as \"the concentration of bleach\" and the dependent variable as \"the reaction rate.\" It also provides a detailed table of controlled variables with their significance and method of control. Essay A, however, demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding, incorrectly identifying its dependent variable as \"Different types of substances dissolved in water\" and its independent variable as \"Temperature change,\" when in fact the type of salt is the independent variable and the temperature change is the dependent variable. This is a critical error in experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is more robust, including a \"Pre-Test\" section to determine the unknown bleach concentration and the optimal wavelength for the spectrophotometer, which demonstrates meticulous planning. Essay A's methodology is sound in principle but the later evaluation section reveals its flaws (e.g., concentrations were too low to produce measurable temperature changes), which a pre-test might have identified and corrected. Finally, while both essays address safety, Essay B's approach is far more detailed with a specific table of chemicals, hazards, and emergency actions. Essay B also provides more specific environmental considerations: \"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly,\" compared to Essay A's more generic statement: \"the chemicals must be disposed of in the designated container.\"",
