  "reasoning": "Essay A is the better submission for Criterion B. While Essay B demonstrates stronger initial planning with a more focused and detailed research question, Essay A provides a more complete and responsible scientific exploration by thoroughly addressing safety and environmental considerations, which are critical for an experimental investigation.\n\nEssay B's primary strength is its research question: \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands in the market has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid measured in moldm-3 using acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\" This question is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining the number of samples, the analyte, the unit of measurement, the methodology, and the titrant concentration. Furthermore, its variable identification is flawless. However, its significant weakness lies in its treatment of safety and environmental factors. The safety section is minimal, and it makes the questionable claim that \"Gloves are not necessary,\" while completely omitting any mention of environmental considerations or waste disposal, a major flaw for a lab-based investigation.\n\nConversely, Essay A presents a good, though less focused, research question and makes a minor error in identifying the independent variable, labeling it as \"Mass of sample before titrating\" instead of the sample source. Despite this, its overall execution of Criterion B is superior. The methodology is well-detailed for two different procedures, and the background provides solid personal and chemical context. Most importantly, Essay A excels where Essay B fails. It includes a robust safety section with multiple specific precautions, such as how to dilute acid and handle hot crucibles. Critically, it also explicitly addresses environmental impact, stating, \"The excess HCl and sample solution were properly disposed of within the lab itself, since dumping them outside may affect soil pH, thereby disrupting the ecosystem.\" This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of a scientist's responsibilities, which Essay B lacks.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay B's omission of environmental considerations is a critical flaw that outweighs the superior quality of its research question. Essay A, by providing a complete exploration that includes appropriate methodology and addresses the safety and environmental impact of the work, better fulfills the requirements of Criterion B.",
