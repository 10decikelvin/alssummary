  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across multiple core elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question is more focused and detailed, stating: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This question is excellent as it specifies the independent variable and its precise range, the dependent variable, the context, and the quantification method. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is clear but lacks the specific range of the independent variable within the question itself.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is far more compelling and scientifically justified. It provides a strong rationale for the choice of pH range, noting that \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4,\" which demonstrates thorough preliminary research and directly informs the experimental design. Essay A's background is relevant but its personal context regarding fertilizers is less integrated with the core chemical principles being investigated. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology includes a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which showcases a more sophisticated and iterative approach to experimental design by explaining choices regarding contact time and centrifugation.\n\nBoth essays effectively identify and control variables. However, Essay B's table of variables offers more detailed chemical justifications, such as explaining that for temperature, \"Increasing the temperature of the system would cause an increase in the concentration of H\u2083O\u207a ions in water... This results in more binding sites being occupied by H\u207a ions\". This level of detail is a hallmark of a stronger investigation.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B addresses all three components explicitly and specifically, stating for environmental concerns: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area to prevent contamination of drainage water.\" Essay A addresses safety but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for a lab-based experimental investigation. This omission, combined with the superior focus and depth of Essay B's research question, background, and methodology, makes Essay B the clear winner.",
