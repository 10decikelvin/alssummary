  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across nearly all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A begins with a highly focused and detailed research question: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern... measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This level of specificity, including the exact values of the independent variable and the methods of measurement for the dependent variable, sets a clear and rigorous foundation. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this detail. Furthermore, Essay A's background is comprehensive, linking complex concepts like Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and reaction mechanisms directly to the hypothesis, whereas Essay B's background is adequate but more superficial.\n\nThe methodological planning in Essay A is exceptional. The author details the evolution of their measurement technique from simple observation to a colorimeter and finally to a lux sensor, showing thoughtful refinement. The control of variables is meticulously outlined in a table that explains not just *what* will be controlled, but *why* and *how*. Essay B's methodology is appropriate, but its variable table is less comprehensive, and it imprecisely identifies the dependent variable as \"temperature difference\" rather than the calculated specific heat capacity.\n\nMost critically, Essay A demonstrates a profound understanding of safety and environmental responsibilities for an experimental investigation. It identifies specific chemical hazards, stating \"Potassium bromate(V) (KBrO\u2083) (TOXIC, OXIDISING)... may cause cancer,\" and details specific mitigation measures like using a fume cupboard. Its environmental considerations are also excellent, mentioning specific disposal methods (\"solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of\") and a proactive reduction in chemical usage. Essay B's safety section is dangerously inadequate; it focuses on generic risks like \"a naked wire\" and breaking glass while completely omitting the specific chemical hazards of potassium nitrate (an oxidizer). Its environmental note is similarly generic: \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box.\" Although Essay B is the only one to explicitly address ethics (\"no ethical precautions needed\"), this minor point is overwhelmingly outweighed by Essay A's superior research question, depth, methodological rigor, and critical safety awareness.",
