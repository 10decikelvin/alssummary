  "reasoning": "Both submissions are of a very high quality and demonstrate excellent scientific practice and communication for this level. However, Essay A is marginally stronger due to its exceptionally well-defined scope and meticulous planning evident throughout the exploration section.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb)\", is a model of clarity and focus. It precisely defines all variables, concentrations, the range of the independent variable, and the exact measurement technique. The background section is equally strong, linking reaction kinetics theory, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation directly to the experimental design. A standout feature is the dedicated \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which clearly documents and justifies modifications to the procedure, such as changing the heating method and identifying the maximum feasible temperature. This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. The variables are comprehensively identified and the control measures are robust and well-explained. The safety section is thorough, addressing specific chemicals and procedures.\n\nEssay B also presents a very strong research question: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\". It provides excellent background information, connecting the experiment to a real-world context (anemia) and clearly explaining the underlying redox chemistry. The methodology is detailed, and the inclusion of calculations justifying the concentration of KMnO\u2084 is commendable. However, while it does mention learning from preliminary trials (\"I noticed that when experimenting with HCl of pH range 2.0 to 4.0, the difference between the volume of KMnO\u2084 used was rather small... Therefore, I changed the range used to pH 2.0 to 6.0\"), this is not presented as systematically as in Essay A's dedicated section. While both essays are excellent, Essay A's slightly more rigorous and detailed presentation of the experimental design process gives it the edge.",
