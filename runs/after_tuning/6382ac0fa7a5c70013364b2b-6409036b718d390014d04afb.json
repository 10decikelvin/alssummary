  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across nearly all elements of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the quality of the research question and the depth of the scientific background. Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator...?\" It specifies the exact conditions of the independent variable, including uncertainty, and clearly defines how the dependent variable will be measured. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources...as determined by two different methodologies...?\" is clear but lacks the scientific precision and specificity demonstrated in Essay B.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background provides a rich and relevant scientific context, linking the BZ reaction to fundamental concepts like \"collision theory\" and the \"Maxwell Boltzmann distribution,\" as well as to significant real-world applications such as \"cardiac arrhythmia.\" Essay A's background is much weaker, focusing more on a personal narrative for choosing the samples rather than providing a deep chemical foundation for the methodologies. While Essay A appropriately lists the overall reactions, it lacks the theoretical depth seen in Essay B.\n\nIn terms of experimental design, Essay B again excels by including a \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that justifies the use of a lux sensor over alternatives, showing a high level of critical thought. Critically, Essay A makes a significant error in its variables section, incorrectly identifying the independent variable as \"Mass of sample before titrating\" when it is actually the *type of sample* (chalk, rangoli, seashell). Essay B correctly identifies all its variables. Both essays have strong safety and environmental sections; however, Essay B's environmental consideration is slightly more developed, as it justifies reducing the experiment's scale to minimize waste: \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" The only shared weakness is the omission of an explicit statement on ethical considerations, though this is minor. Overall, Essay B's superior research question, profound scientific background, and more meticulous approach to methodology and variables make it the better essay.",
