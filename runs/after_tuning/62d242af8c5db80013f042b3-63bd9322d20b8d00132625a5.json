  "reasoning": "Both essays provide clear research questions, but Essay A's RQ is more specific and focused, stating, 'How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 \u00b0C, 40.0 \u00b0C, 60.0 \u00b0C, 80.0 \u00b0C, 100.0 \u00b0C) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Titration?'. This is superior to Essay B's, 'What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?', which lacks specific parameters. Both provide good background information, but Essay A's is more detailed, explaining the relevance of calcium and the chemistry of titration. Essay A excels with a comprehensive methodology and a well-structured table of variables, clearly defining independent, dependent, and controlled variables with specific units and measurement methods (e.g., 'Temperature (\u00b0C)', 'Volume of EDTA (cm\u00b3)'), whereas Essay B only provides a bulleted list of materials and a simplified procedure. While Essay B acknowledges safety with 'wear personal protective equipment...prevent burns' and environmental concerns by mentioning 'paraffin wax is not biodegradable', Essay A's consideration of safety and environmental aspects is more thorough and specific, detailing risks like ammonia fumes and waste management for milk cartons. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and detail in its experimental design and safety considerations.",
