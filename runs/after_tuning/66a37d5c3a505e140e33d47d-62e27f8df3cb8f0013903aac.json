  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it exhibits a higher level of scientific rigor and depth across all assessed elements. Its research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\", is exceptionally focused and detailed, specifying not just the variables and their ranges but also reactant concentrations and the precise measurement technique. Essay A's question is good but less complex. Furthermore, Essay B's background section provides a thorough explanation of advanced chemical principles, including the reaction mechanism, rate laws, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly relevant to its complex research question. In contrast, while Essay A's background is relevant, it is more descriptive and less detailed.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is also stronger, notably because it explicitly details \"Preliminary Testing\" which was used to refine the procedure, such as setting the temperature range and deciding against using cuvette caps. This shows a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. Essay A's methodology is clear and appropriate but lacks this evidence of refinement. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are outstandingly thorough, presenting a chemical-by-chemical risk assessment with specific mitigation and disposal instructions, such as noting for sulfuric acid to \"Neutralise with lime or soda ash.\" Essay A's considerations are adequate, mentioning PPE and unplugging a hotplate, but lack the chemical specificity and depth of Essay B.",
