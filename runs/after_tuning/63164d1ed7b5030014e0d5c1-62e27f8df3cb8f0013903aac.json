  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent investigations, but Essay B is superior due to its significantly greater depth, specificity, and rigor across all assessed elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question is exemplary in its detail: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC)...\". This precision contrasts with Essay A's good but less detailed question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\". Furthermore, Essay B's background information is far more comprehensive, directly linking the Beer-Lambert law and the Arrhenius equation (\"ln(k) = -E^a / R (1/T) + ln(A)\") to the methodology, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of the underlying chemical principles. While Essay A's background on redox titration is relevant, it is less complex. Methodologically, Essay B shows superior planning through its inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies the chosen temperature range. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are substantially more thorough, presented in a detailed table with specific risks and disposal instructions for each chemical, such as for Sulfuric acid: \"Neutralise with lime or soda ash.\" In contrast, Essay A's consideration is minimal, simply stating, \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is insufficient for an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal.",
