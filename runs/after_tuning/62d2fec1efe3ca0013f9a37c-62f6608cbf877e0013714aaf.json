  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and well-structured investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and sophisticated approach to the scientific process, making it the stronger of the two for Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is clear and focused. Its primary strength lies in the depth of its theoretical background. It doesn't just present the Arrhenius equation; it derives the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction (\"we can see that plotting a graph of t against 1/c is going to result in a straight line with a gradient of k\"), demonstrating a superior level of chemical understanding. This theoretical foundation directly informs its sophisticated methodology, which involves quenching the reaction at intervals and using titration to determine the reactant concentration over time. This is a more rigorous and quantitative method than the one proposed in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B explicitly addresses ethical considerations, stating \"There were no notable ethical or environmental issues associated with this experiment,\" fulfilling all aspects of the criterion.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is also focused and appropriate. The background information is relevant, and the inclusion of pKa values provides a good basis for the hypothesis. However, the methodology relies on measuring the \"time taken for the mixture to become colourless\" as determined \"by the naked eye,\" which is inherently more subjective and prone to error than the titration method in Essay B. While the safety and environmental considerations are well-detailed (\"The iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste and the propanone solution should be disposed of in the organic waste\"), the plan lacks the same level of scientific rigor found in Essay B. The evaluation section of Essay A itself points out a key flaw in the experimental design regarding temperature control (\"when I added cooled reagents to a boiling tube, the temperature of the mixture most likely lowered and did not stay constant\"), which highlights a weakness in the initial planning phase covered by Criterion B.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A presents a competent investigation, Essay B is superior due to its deeper theoretical background, more sophisticated and robust experimental design, and more complete consideration of all assessment criteria.",
