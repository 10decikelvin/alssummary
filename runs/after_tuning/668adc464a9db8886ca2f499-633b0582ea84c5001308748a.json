  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a stronger and more comprehensive fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-formulated: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". This question is focused, precise, and sets clear, measurable parameters for the investigation. In contrast, Essay B poses two broader questions: \"1. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion? 2. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its boiling point?\". While clear, these questions lack the specific scope and detail seen in Essay A.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is highly detailed and demonstrates excellent planning for an experimental investigation. It includes a necessary preliminary titration to determine the bleach concentration, showing a proactive approach to a potential experimental issue. The variables are not only identified but thoroughly justified in a table, explaining their significance and the method of control. For example, it states for the control variable 'Temperature of environment', \"the temperature of the solvent affects the collision of molecules which in turn affects the reaction rate.\" Essay B's methodology is appropriate for a data-based study, citing databases like \"ChemPub and Chemeo\", but it is inherently less complex than designing a hands-on experiment.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its handling of safety and environmental considerations, which are critical for an experimental IA. It provides a detailed safety data sheet table and specific instructions for chemical disposal, stating \"potassium iodide and sodium thiosulfate (0.1M)...were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay B, being data-based, appropriately does not include these, but Essay A's thoroughness in this required section highlights its overall superior quality and attention to scientific practice. While Essay B is a competent data-based study, Essay A's detailed planning, specific research question, and rigorous experimental design make it the better example of Criterion B.",
