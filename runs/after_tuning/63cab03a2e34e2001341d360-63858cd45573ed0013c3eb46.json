  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is clearer, more focused, and more detailed than that of Essay A. Essay A's question is convoluted, stating it will be \"comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies,\" which is not the primary experimental aim. Essay B's background information is highly focused, linking personal curiosity directly to relevant chemical theory like heterogeneous catalysis and active sites. In contrast, Essay A's background begins with broad international agreements like \"The London Convention,\" which are only tangentially related to the specific local water sampling experiment.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are strong, but Essay B shows more thoughtful experimental design. For instance, in its variables table, Essay B not only identifies the controlled variable \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" but also details the specific procedure used to control it: \"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a deeper engagement with the practicalities of the investigation. Finally, Essay B comprehensively addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It explicitly states, \"For this experiment, there are no evident ethical considerations,\" and provides specific environmental details: \"...foam produced were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal...\". Essay A has a robust safety section but completely omits any mention of ethics and its environmental consideration is generic (\"Laboratory standards were followed...\"), making Essay B's exploration more complete.",
