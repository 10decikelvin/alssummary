  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and competent experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking and personal engagement in its experimental design, making it the superior example of Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's primary strength is its research question, which is exceptionally well-formed: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\". This question is focused, specific, and includes the exact conditions and measurement technique. The methodology is appropriate, and all safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations are addressed with specific examples, such as using \"tongs to prevent skin burns\" and minimizing food waste due to \"inequality of access to food\". While solid, the experiment itself follows a very standard procedure.\n\nEssay B, while having a slightly less detailed research question, excels in the thoughtfulness of its methodology and control of variables. The student shows significant engagement by attempting to control a difficult variable, stating, \"Due to a lack of access to powdered MnO\u2082, granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of factors affecting reaction rates. Furthermore, the student justifies their unconventional approach to measuring rate and reflects on more standard methods in the \"Reference to Convention\" section. Essay B\u2019s S/E/E section is also excellent, specifically mentioning proper disposal: \"Manganese dioxide catalyst remaining... were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\".\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A executes a standard experiment flawlessly with a perfect research question, Essay B's deeper engagement with experimental challenges and thoughtful control of complex variables showcases a more advanced and personal exploration. The critical thought applied to the methodology in Essay B outweighs the slightly superior formulation of the research question in Essay A.",
