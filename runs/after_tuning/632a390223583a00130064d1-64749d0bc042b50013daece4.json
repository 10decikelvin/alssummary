  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work for Criterion B, but Essay B demonstrates a superior level of scientific exploration.\n\n**Research Question:** Both research questions are clear and focused. Essay A asks, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". This is good, specifying the IV levels. Essay B's question, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", is more detailed and ambitious, specifying ranges for two independent variables and including the precise measurement technique.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Essay B provides a more robust scientific background. It not only explains the Winkler titration method with all relevant chemical equations but also justifies its choice over alternatives like the \"current determination method and fluorescence quenching method\". Furthermore, it explains its hypothesis using core chemical principles, stating, \"The interaction between water and oxygen is through a dipole \u2013 induced dipole intermolecular bond...when Nacl is added...it dissociates to form Na\u207a and Cl\u207b, both these ions form a stronger dipole-dipole interaction causing lesser bonds being made with oxygen\". Essay A's background is relevant but less detailed in its chemical explanations. Both methodologies are appropriate and clearly detailed.\n\n**Variables & Risk Assessment:** Both essays excel in identifying and controlling variables, with comprehensive tables explaining the \"how\" and \"why\" of control. Essay A's inclusion of \"Uncontrolled Variables\" is a point of strength, showing deep reflection. Both provide thorough risk assessments. Essay A's ethical consideration is particularly thoughtful, addressing the \"Use of edible materials\". Essay B's safety section is more detailed, listing specific chemicals and their corresponding disposal methods, such as for sulfuric acid: \"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink.\"\n\nOverall, while Essay A is very strong, Essay B is superior due to its more ambitious and detailed research question, its deeper scientific justification for the hypothesis grounded in chemical principles and supporting literature, and its critical evaluation of different potential methodologies.",
