  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality Criterion B content with focused and highly detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", while Essay B asks, \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity of a Carbonate-Bicarbonate buffer solution...\". Both are exemplary in their specificity. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior exploration process. Its dedicated \"Preliminary Trials\" section is a significant strength, showing how the methodology was refined based on initial observations. For example, the student notes, \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated... Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation of the independent variable\". This demonstrates genuine scientific inquiry and adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's variable control table provides more detailed chemical justifications. For temperature control, it states, \"Pectin also breaks down at higher temperatures, having a lower availability of binding sites... resulting in an overall lower percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions.\" This level of detail surpasses Essay B's more general justification that \"Temperature affects the equilibrium constant\". Finally, Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are more robust; it specifies a critical disposal step: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\". In contrast, Essay B's environmental section justifies minimal impact rather than detailing a disposal protocol. While Essay B is a very strong piece of work, Essay A's evidence of methodological refinement and more thorough justifications make it the better example of Criterion B.",
