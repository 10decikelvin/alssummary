  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is superior. Its primary strength lies in its excellent research question and well-structured experimental design, which form the core of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created,\" is focused, specific, and details the independent variable (oils with varying saturation), the dependent variable (rate of reaction), and the precise method of measurement (colorimetric evaluation). This is supported by a relevant background that scientifically justifies the methodology, such as explaining the Lambert-Beer Law and the choice of wavelength. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\" is confusing; it mentions using \"secondary data\" but the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment. Furthermore, its independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is ill-defined and based on subjective observations rather than quantitative measurement.\n\nEssay A demonstrates a much stronger control of variables, presenting them in a comprehensive table that outlines the \"Method Of Control\" and \"Possible Effects on Results\" for factors like \"Baking Temperature and Time\" and \"Buffer Solution pH Value.\" This shows a high level of thought regarding the experiment's validity. Essay B identifies its variables, but critical factors like temperature are listed under \"Assumptions\" (\"Temperature of all the samples was constant and equal\") rather than being actively controlled, which is a significant methodological weakness.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a far more detailed and commendable \"Risk Assessment,\" listing specific chemical hazards like \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer,\" and explicitly mentioning \"Environmental Issues,\" this strength cannot compensate for its foundational weaknesses. Essay A's risk assessment is present but minimal, stating only general hazards like \"Oven (High Temperatures).\" However, a strong experimental design is paramount. Essay A's scientifically rigorous approach to its research question and variable control makes it a fundamentally better example of scientific exploration, despite its less thorough safety considerations.",
