  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused and specific research question, deeply relevant background information, and a meticulously developed methodology supported by preliminary trials. While Essay B presents a competent investigation, it lacks the scientific rigor and depth seen in Essay A across several key areas.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is exemplary in its detail: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". It clearly defines the independent variable's range (pH 1.0-5.0) and the specific method of quantification. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources...\", is less precise, failing to specify the range of NaCl concentrations and introducing a confounding factor (\"different water sources\") without clear control.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay A is directly linked to the chemical principles of the investigation. It explains the roles of pectin and cellulose, provides chemical structures, and details the mechanism of adsorption, including how pH affects the equilibrium of carboxylic acid groups: \"at lower pH values... the position of equilibrium is shifted to the right... These groups are less prone to bonding with the Cu\u00b2\u207a ions\". Essay B's background is more superficial, explaining the Winkler Method but failing to provide a deep chemical reason for why salinity affects dissolved oxygen.\n\nThird, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of preliminary trials, which justify the chosen experimental parameters. For instance, the author explains capping the pH at 5.0: \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated... Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation\". This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. Essay B's methodology is functional but does not show this level of refinement.\n\nFinally, Essay A's control of variables is more scientifically justified. For each controlled variable, a specific chemical reason is given for its importance. For temperature, it states: \"Pectin also breaks down at higher temperatures, having a lower availability of binding sites... resulting in an overall lower percentage removal\". Essay B's justifications are generic, such as stating that keeping volume constant \"will give dependable results\". Both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental concerns, but Essay A's superior foundation in its research question, background, and methodology makes it the better overall piece of work for Criterion B.",
