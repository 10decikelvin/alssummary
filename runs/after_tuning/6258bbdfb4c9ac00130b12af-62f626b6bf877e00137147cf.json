  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much more thorough and well-structured exploration of its topic. The foundational elements of its investigation are exceptionally strong. Essay A's research question is superior due to its high level of specificity, clearly stating the independent variable's range: \"a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C)\". In contrast, Essay B's question, while clear, lacks detail on its independent variable, \"depending on the expiration date.\" Furthermore, Essay A provides extensive and relevant background information on acid and saponification values, including chemical diagrams, directly linking them to the research question. Essay B's background is almost non-existent, offering only a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\".\n\nMethodologically, Essay A presents a detailed, replicable procedure with a separate \"Justification for methodology,\" which explains the choice of temperatures and concentrations. It also includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables, explaining how and why each is controlled. Essay B, however, provides a procedure for a titration but fails to explain how the independent variable (expiration date) is being managed or investigated, and it completely omits a variables section, which is a critical flaw in experimental design. Finally, as both are experimental investigations, Essay A correctly addresses all required considerations, with dedicated sections for \"Safety issues,\" \"Ethical issues,\" and \"Environmental Issues\" that are specific and detailed. Essay B has a solid risk assessment for safety, but its environmental consideration is generic, and it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations.",
