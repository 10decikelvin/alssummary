  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and detail across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact mass of the reactant, the precise range of concentrations for the independent variable, and the method and duration of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, while clear, lacks this level of specificity. Furthermore, Essay B's background information is more in-depth, not only covering the neutralization reaction but also delving into the chemical kinetics by explaining the carbonic acid intermediate and applying collision theory.\n\nThe methodology and variable control in Essay B are exemplary. It includes a dedicated \"Pre-test\" section to justify the chosen variable range, a detailed table for controlled variables with justifications for each, and a clear, illustrated experimental setup. This contrasts with Essay A, which presents a simpler methodology and has a minor inconsistency in its variables section, first listing \"Mass of indigestion tablets\" as an independent variable but then stating, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet.\" Finally, Essay B's handling of safety and environmental considerations is far more comprehensive. It presents a detailed safety table with specific hazards, symbols, and emergency actions for each chemical, whereas Essay A provides a single, more generic safety sentence: \"Following lab instructions, gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\" Essay B also demonstrates a more sophisticated environmental consideration by calculating chemical quantities to minimize waste. While Essay A represents a competent investigation, Essay B consistently demonstrates a deeper, more thorough, and more scientifically mature approach to experimental design.",
