  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A for Criterion B. While both essays present viable investigations, Essay B excels in its precision, depth, and adherence to scientific conventions. Essay B's research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction...\", is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying reactants, concentrations, independent variable ranges, and the exact quantity to be determined with units. In contrast, Essay A's question is somewhat cumbersome and less focused. Furthermore, Essay B's background section provides a more rigorous theoretical foundation, explicitly linking the Beer-Lambert law and the Arrhenius equation to its methodology, whereas Essay A's background, while interesting, is more descriptive.\n\nThe methodology section of Essay B is strengthened by its explicit inclusion of \"Preliminary Testing,\" which demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design\u2014a hallmark of strong exploration. Essay A's methodology is detailed but lacks this element of refinement. The most significant difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides a comprehensive, chemical-specific risk assessment in a table, detailing hazards and mitigation strategies for each substance, and importantly, it addresses environmental concerns, stating, \"Do not wash down the sink as it may be hazardous to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay A's risk assessment is very brief, mentioning only general hazards like \"Oven (High Temperatures)\" and \"Glassware (Fragile),\" and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a major oversight for an experimental investigation.",
