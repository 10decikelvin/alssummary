  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior understanding of the underlying chemistry in its background section, but Essay A presents a more complete and viable investigation overall. Essay B's background is excellent, clearly explaining the chemical principle of the proposed methodology: \"A redox titration may be undertaken, as the different temperatures of lemon juice are titrated with iodine, the ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid.\" Furthermore, its hypothesis is justified with sophisticated reasoning, referencing the \"Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve theory.\" However, Essay B is critically incomplete, as the provided text cuts off before the procedure, apparatus list, and safety/ethical/environmental considerations.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a complete exploration section. Its research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear and supported by relevant background information and a testable hypothesis. Crucially, Essay A provides a full, step-by-step procedure, a complete list of controlled variables, and addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. For instance, it specifies control methods (\"Each solution will be heated for exactly 600 seconds\") and environmental protocol (\"Waste was disposed into the disposal box to be emptied by the lab technician\"). While its background chemistry is less detailed than Essay B's, its methodology is appropriate for the research question and is fully outlined. A complete, methodologically sound investigation plan (Essay A) is superior to a conceptually strong but incomplete one (Essay B).",
