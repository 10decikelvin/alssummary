  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior because it demonstrates a more comprehensive and methodologically sound approach to the scientific process from start to finish. \n\nFirstly, Essay B establishes a much stronger context and rationale for its investigation. The background section connects the experiment to real-world environmental issues like the London Convention and discusses specific local examples, such as the pollution in Rawal Lake. In contrast, Essay A completely lacks any background information, leaving the reader to guess the purpose and relevance of the investigation. \n\nSecondly, the experimental design in Essay B is more detailed and rigorous. It explicitly lists the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, which is a fundamental aspect of experimental design that Essay A omits. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is detailed, including a specific procedure for standardizing the titrant, which shows a higher level of chemical understanding. While Essay A outlines a procedure, it is less complete and lacks this level of detail.\n\nThirdly, while both essays include sections on safety and environmental considerations, Essay B's 'Risk Assessment' is more thorough, listing specific hazards for each chemical used (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\"). Essay A's section is adequate but less specific. \n\nFinally, Essay B's inclusion of a dedicated 'Assumptions' section further demonstrates a deeper level of critical thinking about the limitations of the experimental setup compared to Essay A. Although Essay A includes a 'Strengths and Limitations' table, the overall structure and completeness of the report in Essay B are of a higher quality.",
