  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better as it provides a more thorough and complete exploration that aligns with IB criteria, particularly in its research question and its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, Essay B presents a more detailed and focused inquiry. Essay B's question is, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". This is superior to Essay A's, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", because Essay B's question specifies a sample volume (100cm\u00b3) and explicitly states a key controlled variable (temperature), demonstrating a more developed experimental design from the outset.\n\nWhile both essays provide relevant background information and appropriate methodologies, Essay B's is better structured and its variables are more clearly justified. Essay A's methodology is confusingly numbered (e.g., section \u2464 appears before \u2462), hindering clarity. In contrast, Essay B's method is logically presented in sequential stages. Furthermore, both essays correctly identify variables, but Essay B provides explicit justification in its table, stating for example that keeping volume constant \"will give dependable results as all samples will be tested on the same conditions.\"\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, both of which are experimental investigations where this is mandatory. Essay A's safety section is critically incomplete, mentioning only one hazard for acetic acid (\"Acetic acid is very dangerous as it could harm one's eyes\") and completely omitting any mention of sodium hydroxide, ethical concerns, or environmental impact. This is a major flaw. Conversely, Essay B provides a comprehensive and specific section, addressing safety (\"Wear gloves to protects hands from acids like sulphuric acid\"), ethics (\"No animal or human being was harmed for the success of this experiment.\"), and environmental disposal (\"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation so it minimises the risk to the environment.\"). This comprehensive approach makes Essay B a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
