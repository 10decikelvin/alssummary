  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it presents a more sophisticated and complete exploration. The primary difference lies in the quality of the research question and the thoroughness of the associated planning. Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is analytical and seeks to establish a relationship, which is a higher level of inquiry than Essay A's descriptive question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\". Furthermore, Essay B's background provides excellent real-world context by linking the investigation to \"global warming issues\" and provides strong theoretical grounding with combustion equations and an explanation of carbon chain length's effect on enthalpy. While Essay A's background is relevant, it lacks this depth and contextualization.\n\nEssay B also excels in its methodology and control of variables. It justifies the selection of its independent variable range with real-world relevance, noting \"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia, it is logical to start with it\". This level of thought is absent in Essay A. Moreover, Essay B's justification for its dependent variable measurement shows advanced chemical awareness: \"The measurement units of kJ/g were used over kJ/mol to increase the accuracy and reliability of the results since gasoline is not purely made of octane\".\n\nCrucially, Essay B includes a complete risk assessment. It addresses safety (\"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\"), ethical considerations (\"No ethical considerations were considered\"), and environmental impact (\"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\"). In stark contrast, Essay A, despite using a hazardous chemical like dichloromethane, completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw in an experimental investigation. While Essay A presents a competent plan, Essay B's submission is more rigorous, better justified, and fully compliant with the requirements of Criterion B.",
