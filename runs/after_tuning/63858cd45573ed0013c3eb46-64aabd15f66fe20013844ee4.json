  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its scientific rigor, methodological design, and adherence to IB assessment criteria for Criterion B. While both essays present clear and focused research questions, Essay A builds a much stronger foundation through its background research and experimental design. Essay A's background provides relevant chemical theory, explaining that \"heterogenous catalysis is characterized by the adsorption of reactant molecules to these active sites,\" which directly justifies the investigation into the mass of the catalyst. In contrast, Essay B's methodology contains a significant chemical flaw: it uses acid-base titration to measure ascorbic acid, but fails to address in its background that \"orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid... might have reacted with the NaOH\". This confounding variable fundamentally undermines the validity of its method, a weakness that should have been addressed in the planning stage, not just as a post-lab limitation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A exhibits a higher level of detail in its control of variables. For instance, its attempt to control the \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" by grinding granules with \"200 turns at medium pressure\" shows a sophisticated understanding of potential sources of error. Essay B's controlled variables are appropriate, but do not show the same depth of consideration.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides a comprehensive \"Safety & Risk Assessment,\" specifically mentioning the hazards of \"Manganese Dioxide (MnO\u2082)\" and different concentrations of \"Hydrogen Peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082)\". It also explicitly addresses ethical considerations and provides specific details on environmental measures, such as how waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\". Essay B's coverage is critically deficient; its safety section is minimal, stating \"Gloves are not necessary,\" and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental concerns, which is a major failure for an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal. Overall, Essay A presents a more complete, thoughtful, and scientifically sound exploration.",
