  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger as it demonstrates a more thorough, focused, and complete approach to the experimental exploration.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is exemplary in its clarity and detail: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". It precisely outlines the independent variable with specific values, the dependent variable, and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity, which is only partially clarified later in the introduction.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology and background are more robust. The inclusion of a pre-test to determine the unknown bleach concentration via titration shows a high level of planning and scientific rigor. The background information is comprehensive, covering previous studies, the Beer-Lambert law, and the chemistry of both bleach and dyes. Essay A's background is relevant but less detailed, and its methodology is poorly organized with confusing numerical ordering of steps (e.g., \u2460, \u2464, \u2465, \u2462).\n\nThird, the treatment of variables is more thorough in Essay B. While both essays identify variables, Essay B provides more detailed justifications for its controlled variables, such as explaining *why* temperature affects the reaction rate: \"the temperature of the solvent affects the collision of molecules which in turn affects the reaction rate.\" Essay A's justifications are comparatively brief.\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B includes a comprehensive section on safety and environmental considerations. It details specific hazards and provides clear instructions for waste disposal: \"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay A, despite being an experimental investigation, has an incomplete safety table and completely omits any mention of environmental impact or disposal, which is a major flaw in this criterion.",
