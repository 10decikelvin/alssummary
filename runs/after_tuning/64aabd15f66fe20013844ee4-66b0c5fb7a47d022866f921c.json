  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both submissions are experimental investigations. Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically sound exploration than Essay A. The primary differentiator lies in the appropriateness of the methodology. Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is investigated using calorimetry, which is the correct and standard procedure for determining enthalpy of combustion. In contrast, Essay A's methodology is fundamentally flawed for its research question. It asks, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid... using acid-base titration\". However, the essay itself identifies a critical flaw in this approach, stating: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This means the experiment measures total acidity, not specifically ascorbic acid concentration, and therefore cannot answer the research question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its handling of variables and safety considerations. It provides a detailed table of controlled variables with robust justifications, such as controlling the source of E10 fuel because \"E10 fuel in Australia contains anywhere from 9-10% ethanol\". Essay B also presents a complete risk assessment, explicitly addressing safety (\"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\"), ethics (\"No ethical considerations were considered\"), and environment (\"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\"). Essay A's treatment is significantly weaker; its safety section is minimal, stating \"No other special safety precautions are required,\" and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major oversight for an experimental investigation. While both essays have well-defined research questions with good personal context, Essay B's superior experimental design, more detailed variable control, and comprehensive risk assessment make it the better submission.",
