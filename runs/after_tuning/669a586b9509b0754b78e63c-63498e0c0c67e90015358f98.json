  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and thorough approach to Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused, specifying the exact concentrations to be tested directly within the question: \"What is the average rate of reaction ... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3)...?\". In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility...\", is clear but less specific, defining the range later in the variables section. While both essays have strong background sections and appropriate methodologies, Essay A's inclusion of a pre-test (\"I conducted pretests...to help determine what IV-values I should use\") shows excellent scientific forethought.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A excels here, providing a detailed safety table with hazard symbols and emergency actions. It also explicitly addresses both ethical considerations (\"This experiment has no ethical considerations, other than keeping in mind the minimisation of waste.\") and environmental impact with specific disposal instructions (\"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water...\"). In stark contrast, Essay B provides only a minimal safety paragraph and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental factors. For an experimental lab investigation, these omissions represent a critical flaw in the exploration phase.\n\nTherefore, despite the sophisticated methodology of Essay B, Essay A is superior due to its meticulously crafted research question and its comprehensive and explicit handling of all required safety, ethical, and environmental aspects of the investigation.",
