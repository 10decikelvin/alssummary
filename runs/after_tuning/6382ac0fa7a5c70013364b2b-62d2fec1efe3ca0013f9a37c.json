  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong plans for their respective investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated and well-integrated approach to the scientific process, making it the better example for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A has a clear research question: \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...?\" The background provides good personal context, and the dual-methodology approach is commendable for comparative purposes. The procedures and variables are clearly outlined. However, one of the chosen methods, thermal decomposition via a Bunsen burner, is methodologically weak for quantitative analysis, as achieving and maintaining a consistent and sufficient decomposition temperature is very difficult. The student even acknowledges this limitation later, stating, \"the thermal decomposition method was inaccurate since the temperature provided for heating was too low.\" This indicates a flaw in the initial design.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, presents a more robust and focused investigation. The research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is specific and leads to a more complex investigation involving reaction kinetics. The background information is excellent, linking concepts like reaction rates, pKa, and the Arrhenius equation directly to the hypothesis. The methodology for determining the activation energy by varying temperature is scientifically sound and appropriate for the IB level. The variables are well-defined, and the safety and environmental considerations are specific and thorough, including correct disposal procedures for different chemical wastes (\"iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste and the propanone solution should be disposed of in the organic waste\").\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is a solid investigation, Essay B is superior due to its more advanced chemical concept (activation energy), the stronger theoretical foundation provided in its background, a more rigorous and appropriate experimental design, and slightly more detailed safety/environmental protocols.",
