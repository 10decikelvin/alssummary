  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior due to its highly focused and specific research question, well-structured methodology, and deeper engagement with the scientific context. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is a model of clarity and detail, specifying the exact values for the independent variable and a key controlled variable (time). In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity regarding the independent variable's range.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is logically sequenced, easy to follow, and includes an excellent justification for the chosen voltage range, stating it will explore and \"challenged\" the advice for amateur jewellers. This demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking. Essay B's methodology is less clear, attempting to combine two different measurement techniques (Winkler and probe) which complicates the investigation and is not well-established in the research question. The procedure in Essay B is also confusingly structured into \"stages\" that are not entirely sequential.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify variables and provide thorough safety, ethical, and environmental considerations appropriate for their experimental nature, Essay A's overall design is more focused and scientifically rigorous. Essay A's background research is also stronger, directly linking Faraday's law to the hypothesis and citing previous, similar studies to inform its own design. Therefore, Essay A's superior research question and experimental design make it the better submission for Criterion B.",
