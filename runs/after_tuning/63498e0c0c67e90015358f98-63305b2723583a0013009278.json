  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and personal engagement, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Both essays feature clear, focused, and well-defined research questions. Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is excellent because it specifies the methodology in the question itself. Essay B's question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is also very strong due to its precise definition of the independent variable's range and the fixed duration.\n\n**Background & Context:** Essay B provides a more compelling personal context for the investigation, linking it to the restoration of a family car. This personal engagement often leads to a more thoughtful exploration. The background information in Essay B is also more detailed, explaining the principles of electrolysis and explicitly stating Faraday's Laws, which provides a strong theoretical foundation for the hypothesis. Essay A's background is good and relevant, but its personal connection (\"avid plant lover\") feels slightly less developed than B's.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Both essays outline clear, logical, and appropriate procedures. Essay A's table of controlled variables, which includes *why* each variable must be controlled, is slightly more detailed than Essay B's. However, Essay B's method includes sensible practical steps like performing a mock experiment and combining solutions to ensure consistency, which shows a higher level of practical planning.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** This is the most significant point of differentiation. Both are experimental investigations requiring these considerations. Essay A's safety section is adequate but brief (\"Lab coat and gloves were worn\"). Crucially, it has no mention of environmental considerations or waste disposal, which is a major omission for an experiment involving chemical solutions. In contrast, Essay B provides a much more robust section. It details specific risks (\"minor electrocution,\" \"skin irritation,\" \"eye irritation\") and, importantly, addresses environmental impact directly: \"Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic to aquatic organisms... disposed as a hazardous waste,\" and \"the batteries... were recycled.\" This comprehensive approach to responsible lab work makes Essay B significantly stronger.\n\nIn conclusion, while both essays are well-structured, Essay B's superior handling of safety and environmental aspects, combined with a stronger contextual background, makes it the better of the two.",
