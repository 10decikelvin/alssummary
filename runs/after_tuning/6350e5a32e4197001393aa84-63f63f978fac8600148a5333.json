  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A due to its highly specific research question, greater depth in background research, and more meticulous experimental design and control of variables. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is a model of clarity and focus, specifying the independent variable range and the exact analytical technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources...\", is clear but less detailed, lacking a specified concentration range.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is far more comprehensive and demonstrates a deeper engagement with the underlying chemistry, explaining concepts like biosorption, chelation, and the specific functional groups in orange peels (\"pectin, cellulose and lignin\") that facilitate the process. While Essay A's background on the Winkler method is relevant, it does not achieve the same level of scientific depth. Furthermore, Essay B includes a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which showcases a sophisticated and iterative approach to experimental design not present in Essay A. The identification and justification of controlled variables in Essay B is also more thorough, considering subtle factors like \"Brand of Oranges used\" and \"Shaking speed (400 rpm)\".\n\nWhile Essay A presents a solid investigation with an appropriate methodology and adequately addresses all required components, including safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, it does not match the rigor and focus of Essay B. Both essays provide sufficient safety and environmental protocols for their respective experimental work. However, the superior quality of the foundational elements in Essay B\u2014the research question, background, and experimental planning\u2014clearly sets it apart as the better example of IB-level scientific exploration.",
