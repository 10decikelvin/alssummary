  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a higher level of exploration and chemical understanding. Both essays present strong, focused research questions; Essay A's is \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V)... affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" and Essay B's is \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\". Both are specific and measurable. However, Essay B's superiority lies in the depth of its background research and the sophistication of its methodology, which was clearly developed through significant personal engagement and problem-solving. Essay B identifies a major analytical challenge\u2014that the target molecule \"forms a clear, colourless solution\"\u2014and intelligently solves it by researching and applying advanced concepts like transition metal complexation and micelle formation to make UV-Vis spectrometry viable. This is explicitly detailed in its \"Development and pilot studies\" section, where it explains the need to form a complex with copper(II) ions and then addresses the subsequent precipitation issue by testing dyes to instigate micelle formation. In contrast, Essay A presents a well-executed but standard electroplating experiment with a methodology that follows a more predictable textbook procedure. While Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are slightly more specific regarding chemical disposal (\"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\"), Essay B's profound engagement with complex chemical theory (e.g., crystal field theory) and its demonstration of iterative experimental design make it a much stronger example of scientific exploration.",
