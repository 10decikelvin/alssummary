  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific exploration, particularly in its theoretical foundation and experimental design.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research question and background, both are excellent, but Essay B's is superior. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-detailed: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\". However, Essay B's background section shows a deeper level of engagement by deriving the mathematical framework for the entire investigation. It explicitly links the Arrhenius equation and the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction, stating, \"we have derived a method to derive the rate constant of a reaction at a given temperature...plotting a graph of t against 1/c is going to result in a straight line with a gradient of k\". This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding that is central to the exploration, surpassing the good but more descriptive background of Essay A.\n\nSecond, in terms of methodology and variables, Essay B's approach is more complex and demanding. It employs a quenching and back-titration technique to study reaction kinetics, a conceptually more advanced design than the direct titration in Essay A. Both essays correctly identify and control their variables effectively. For instance, Essay A controls for \"Source of fruits\" and \"Concentration of iodine solution\", while Essay B controls for \"Volumes and initial concentrations of reactants\" and \"Drop rate of burette\". While both are competent, the ambition of Essay B's methodology is greater.\n\nFinally, regarding safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, both essays address all required components for an experimental investigation. Essay A provides a slightly more thoughtful ethical consideration, noting \"the inequality of access to food in poorer areas of the world...the least possible amount of fruits was used\". Essay B's safety section is also specific, mentioning that \"Ethyl acetate is flammable...ensure the absence of any source of flame\". While Essay A's considerations are marginally better developed, this does not outweigh the significant advantage Essay B holds in its profound chemical and mathematical exploration, which is the core of Criterion B. Essay B's advanced theoretical underpinning and more complex experimental design make it the stronger piece of work.",
