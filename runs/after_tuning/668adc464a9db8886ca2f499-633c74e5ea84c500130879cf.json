  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. The core of its strength lies in its focused and well-defined research question: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". This question is excellent because it precisely states the independent variable (five specific concentrations of bleach), the dependent variable (reaction rate), and the method of measurement (spectrophotometer). In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad and attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously, which is poor experimental design for this level.\n\nEssay A's background section is thorough, relevant, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the underlying chemical principles, from the Beer-Lambert law to the mechanism of bleach action on chromophores. Essay B's background is superficial, defining solubility but offering little depth on the factors affecting it, such as lattice enthalpy or hydration enthalpy, which are crucial for comparing different anions. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed and repeatable, with specific volumes and concentrations outlined. Essay B's procedure is vague, using phrases like \"desired weights were measured\" without specifying them, and \"stirred until the solution was supersaturated,\" which lacks a clear procedural endpoint.\n\nThe handling of variables further distinguishes the two essays. Essay A presents a comprehensive table of controlled variables, explaining the significance of each, such as keeping the \"Concentration of blue food dye\" constant to avoid a second independent variable. Essay B's variable section is confused, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable rather than the type of anion, and its list of controlled variables is minimal (\"Boiling temperature\" and \"Cation group\"), omitting crucial factors like the volume of water used. Finally, Essay A includes a detailed safety table with specific chemical hazards and emergency actions, alongside clear environmental disposal instructions. Essay B's safety section is generic (\"The salt used in this experiment can cause irritation\"), and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation.",
