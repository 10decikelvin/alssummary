  "reasoning": "Essay A is the superior essay. Its strength begins with a highly specific and focused research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (kJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This question precisely defines the independent variable (ionic radii of specific ions), the dependent variable (d-orbital splitting energy in kJ/mol), and the method of determination (spectrophotometry), which is a hallmark of an excellent investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources...?\", is clear but less focused, as it introduces a secondary, uncontrolled variable (\"different water sources\") that complicates the primary relationship being investigated.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background section provides a deep, relevant theoretical foundation, explaining concepts like d-orbital splitting, ligands, and the spectrochemical series in a way that directly justifies the experimental design. For example, it explains why ammonia is used as a ligand: \"it is higher in the spectrochemical series than H\u2082O, meaning it reacts more strongly with metal ions, thereby possessing the ability to displace the water ligands\". Essay B's background on dissolved oxygen and the Winkler method is adequate but lacks the same level of theoretical depth. While both essays are experimental and provide appropriate methodologies and correctly identified variables, Essay A's overall scientific rigor is higher. Both essays also competently address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific details, such as Essay A noting to \"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\" and Essay B stating that \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\". However, the foundational strength of Essay A's research question and background establishes it as the better example of Criterion B.",
