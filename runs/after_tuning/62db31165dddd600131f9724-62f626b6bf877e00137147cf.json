  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior because it establishes a strong scientific foundation through its detailed background information, which is central to Criterion B (Exploration). Essay A's background clearly explains the chemical principles of its investigation, stating, \"Ascorbic acid is easily oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid\" and detailing the specific redox titration: \"ascorbic acid will be oxidized with iodine...The iodine is reduced to iodide ions.\" This demonstrates a thorough exploration of the topic. In contrast, Essay B completely lacks a background section, failing to explain the principles of complexometric titration, the role of EDTA, or the function of the Eriochrome Black T indicator. Furthermore, Essay A's research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is focused and well-phrased. Essay B's question is weak, improperly including the methodology within the question itself: \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content...\". While Essay B includes a good risk assessment with specific chemical warnings like \"EDTA, Eriochrome Black T, Ethanol, and Ammonia Buffer when applied to the skin solution are very corrosive,\" and Essay A omits this section entirely, this does not compensate for Essay B's fundamental lack of scientific exploration. An investigation's quality is primarily judged on its scientific context and rationale, which Essay A provides and Essay B completely ignores.",
