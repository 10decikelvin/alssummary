  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably better as it presents a more cohesive and complete scientific exploration that fully meets the requirements of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its well-structured investigation where the background, variables, and methodology are logically aligned. For example, its research question is highly specific, identifying the \"different active ingredients... in different brands of indigestion tablets\" and how they \"compare in the volume (cm3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration.\" This specificity is supported by relevant background information, including the correctly balanced chemical equations for each antacid's reaction. Furthermore, Essay A thoroughly addresses safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a critical requirement for an experimental investigation. It specifically notes safety precautions for the primary hazard: \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl,\" and provides a clear environmental directive: \"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a decent research question and theoretical background, contains a fundamental scientific flaw in its experimental design and completely omits required sections. The background correctly identifies that the de-icing effect is related to the number of ions, stating \"the more is the number of ions, the lower the freezing point we get.\" However, the methodology fails to act on this principle; it controls for mass (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\") rather than moles. Since the salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, MgCl2) have different molar masses, 5 grams of each will produce a different number of moles of ions, undermining the ability to make a valid comparison based on the stated theory. Most critically, Essay B makes no mention whatsoever of any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major omission for a lab-based experiment. Therefore, due to its superior experimental design, scientific cohesion, and complete fulfillment of the criterion's requirements, Essay A is the stronger piece of work.",
