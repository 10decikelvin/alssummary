  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary difference lies in the level of detail, scientific rigor, and completeness. Essay B's research question is exceptionally strong and focused: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". This is a model of a high-quality research question, specifying not just the variables but also their precise ranges and the exact method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea... using dichloromethane in a separating funnel,\" is clear but lacks the same level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section provides a robust theoretical framework, explaining concepts like rate laws, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly necessary for its investigation. Essay B also includes a section on \"Preliminary Testing,\" which justifies the chosen methodology and variable ranges, demonstrating a higher level of independent engagement. Essay A's background is relevant but more descriptive. Most critically, Essay B includes a comprehensive table addressing safety and environmental concerns for each chemical, stating \"Do not wash down the sink... Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay A has a brief safety section but completely omits environmental considerations, a significant flaw for an experimental investigation using dichloromethane, a chlorinated organic solvent. This omission, combined with the superior focus and depth of Essay B, makes the choice clear.",
