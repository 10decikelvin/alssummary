  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work for Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally superior due to its more thorough and contextually-justified experimental design. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is exceptionally well-phrased with the evaluative term \"To what extent,\" making it a model IB research question. However, Essay A's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is also clear and focused.\n\nWhere Essay A excels is in the depth of its planning. Its justification for the independent variable's range is superb, stating, \"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia, it is logical to start with it... E85 is an exception to this and has been used due to the real-world context and relevance of this fuel.\" This demonstrates a strong connection to the real-world context. Furthermore, Essay A's controlled variables are presented in a highly effective table that details not only *why* a variable is controlled but also specifically *how* it will be controlled. Essay A also includes insightful qualitative observations about soot formation that link directly to the underlying chemistry, demonstrating a deeper scientific engagement than Essay B's more standard observations of titration color changes.\n\nWhile Essay B has slightly more detailed safety protocols, particularly regarding the hot plate, Essay A's environmental consideration is more specific, noting that gasohol mixtures should not be poured down the drain because \"aquatic life will be harmed\" and must be disposed of via a \"waste collection company.\" In contrast, Essay B simply states \"No significant environmental concerns.\" Overall, Essay A's meticulous planning, strong real-world justification for its variables, and deeper qualitative insights make it the stronger of two excellent explorations.",
