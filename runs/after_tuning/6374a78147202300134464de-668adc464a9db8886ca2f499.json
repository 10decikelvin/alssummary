  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations and the precise measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity. The background information in Essay B is also significantly more thorough, referencing previous studies, explaining the complex chemistry of chromophores, and detailing the necessity of a preliminary titration to determine the initial bleach concentration. Essay A's background on enthalpy and reactivity is relevant but more foundational.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is superior due to its sophisticated approach and detailed planning. It justifies the choice of wavelength for the spectrophotometer and includes a pre-test, which indicates a well-considered experimental design. The table of controlled variables in Essay B provides not just the variable but its significance, showing a deeper understanding of experimental control than Essay A's simpler list. For example, Essay B explains *why* temperature must be controlled: \"the temperature of the solvent affects the collision of molecules which in turn affects the reaction rate.\" Essay A's justification is less developed. Furthermore, the safety, environmental, and ethical considerations are more robust in Essay B, which presents a detailed safety data sheet for its chemicals and specifies appropriate disposal methods (\"disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor\"). Essay A's safety section is present but more generic, and its disposal plan (\"disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\") is less environmentally sound. While Essay A presents a competent investigation, Essay B exhibits a higher level of scientific rigor, depth, and planning throughout its exploration.",
