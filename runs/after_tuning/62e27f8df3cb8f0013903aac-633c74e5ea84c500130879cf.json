  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined and focused: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". This level of specificity, including concentrations, temperature ranges, and measurement techniques, provides a clear and manageable scope. In stark contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is far too broad and lacks any specific parameters for the salts, anions, or temperature range being investigated.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is thorough, relevant, and directly supports the methodology by explaining the reaction mechanism, Beer-Lambert law, rate laws, and the Arrhenius equation. Essay B's background is superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility (\"the maximum quantity of a substance that can be completely dissolved\") without delving into the essential concepts of lattice and hydration enthalpies that would explain the role of the anion.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A presents a detailed, replicable procedure and clearly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables with robust justifications. For example, it explains why the wavelength was chosen and how concentrations will be kept constant (\"Solutions used will be taken from the same stock solution\"). Essay B's methodology is vague, with steps like \"Five samples of each salt were taken according to the calculation of the solubility,\" which fails to explain the calculation or the masses used. Its identification of variables is confusing, listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and providing an incomplete list of controlled variables.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its risk assessment. It provides a detailed table outlining specific safety and environmental risks for each chemical, such as for Sulfuric acid: \"Causes severe skin burns...Dispose according to local legislation. Neutralise with lime or soda ash.\" Essay B's safety section is generic (\"use of surgical masks, gloves, and laboratory goggles is suggested\") and critically omits any mention of environmental considerations or proper disposal procedures, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation.",
