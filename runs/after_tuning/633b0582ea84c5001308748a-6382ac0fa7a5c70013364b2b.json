  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and well-designed investigation, making it superior in Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources: chalk, rangoli powder, and seashells, as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\", is highly specific and focused, clearly outlining the independent variables (source, methodology) and the dependent variable (mass of CaCO\u2083). In contrast, Essay A's research questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack the same level of detail and specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is exemplary for an experimental investigation. It provides two distinct, detailed procedures and a comprehensive table of variables. The identification and justification of controlled variables like \"Time - Varying heating periods can affect the results... so a time of 3 minutes was set\" and \"Temperature - ...the same Bunsen Burner was used for each trial\" show a high level of planning and control. While Essay A's data-based methodology is appropriate, its scope is inherently simpler. Essay A does identify a crucial control, \"by including only linear primary alcohols,\" which is a strength, but it cannot match the depth of experimental design demonstrated in Essay B.\n\nFinally, as an experimental investigation, Essay B correctly includes a detailed \"HAZARDS, CONCERNS AND SAFETY\" section. It provides specific, actionable advice, such as ensuring \"acid is added to the water rather than the other way around\" and noting that excess solutions were \"disposed of within the lab itself, since dumping them outside may affect soil pH.\" Essay A, being a data-based investigation, correctly omits these sections as they are not relevant. However, Essay B's successful inclusion of these required elements for its investigation type highlights its completeness. Although Essay A presents a more detailed scientific background on intermolecular forces, Essay B's superior research question, robust experimental methodology, and thorough consideration of variables and safety make it the stronger essay for Criterion B.",
