  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A, showcasing a higher level of scientific rigor across all assessed elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, while both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's is more detailed and specific. Essay B asks, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", and its variables table specifies the exact masses to be tested. Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is focused but lacks the same level of procedural detail embedded within the experimental design section.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology and control of variables are far more meticulous. Essay B shows exceptional awareness of subtle variables, stating it will control \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" by grinding granules with \"200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a deep understanding of experimental design. In contrast, Essay A's methodology has a significant flaw: it outlines a sequential procedure (testing one ice cube after another), which directly contradicts its stated controlled variable of \"Surrounding temperature and pressure,\" as conditions could change over the course of an hour. Furthermore, Essay A fails to identify or control the initial mass or surface area of the \"identical ice cubes,\" a critical oversight.\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B includes a comprehensive section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is entirely absent from Essay A. Essay B provides specific safety details, noting that \"3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution was used\" to reduce risk and references the CLEAPPS safety database. It also explicitly addresses environmental concerns, stating that waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal.\" The complete omission of this section in Essay A is a major failure for an experimental investigation, making Essay B the unequivocally better submission.",
