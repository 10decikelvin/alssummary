  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and competent experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific exploration and chemical understanding. Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying the independent variable range and a key controlled variable within the question itself. Essay A's background section is a significant strength, as it not only explains the chemistry of Vitamin B6 but also delves into the principles of the chosen analytical technique, stating that \"when pyridoxine hydrochloride is dissolved in water, it forms a clear, colourless solution... For UV-Vis spectrometry to be applied, the pyridoxine must be complexed with a d-block transition metal,\" and then explaining this using crystal field theory.\n\nThe most decisive factor is Essay A's methodology development. It explicitly details a process of refinement through pilot studies to overcome experimental hurdles. For example, it notes, \"a white powder remained... To remove these contaminants... I decided to filter it\" and \"I noticed a green precipitate forming... To address this issue, I chose to implement the concept micelles formation.\" This documentation of problem-solving and procedural adaptation is a hallmark of a superior scientific exploration compared to Essay B's more standard, albeit well-described, procedure. Furthermore, Essay A's list of controlled variables is more comprehensive and specific.\n\nWhile both essays adequately cover safety, ethical, and environmental considerations for their respective experimental designs, Essay B contains a minor contradiction in its environmental section, initially suggesting \"The plating electrolyte solution can be flushed down the drain\" before correctly stating that \"Copper sulphate is a pesticide... It can be harmful to the environment\". In contrast, Essay A provides a consistently professional and appropriate approach to disposal. Overall, Essay A's sophisticated background, demonstrated methodological refinement, and more extensive variable control make it the stronger submission.",
