  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and scientifically sound explorations. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and detail, making it the superior submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying not only the independent and dependent variables but also the exact temperature values and the analytical technique: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". Essay B's question is also focused, but slightly less specific. Essay A further excels by including a \"Comparison of Method\" section, where it justifies choosing complexometric titration over alternatives like FAAS and ISE-CT, demonstrating critical thinking about the appropriateness of the methodology.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify variables, Essay A's use of detailed tables to list independent, dependent, and a comprehensive set of controlled variables, along with the specific methods for their control, is exemplary. For instance, for the controlled variable \"Volume of EDTA solution (20.0cm\u00b3),\" it explains, \"If the amount of EDTA is lesser therefore the remaining Mg2+ ions will not be bonded...Hence, the titration process will be impracticable.\" This level of justification is not present in Essay B.\n\nFinally, Essay A's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is more robust. It uses a detailed table for safety, linking specific hazards like ammonia gas to necessary precautions like using a fume cupboard. It also explicitly addresses environmental concerns, noting that pre-determining the amount of milk needed \"may reduce the tendency of food wastage.\" In contrast, Essay B's statement of \"No significant environmental concerns\" is correct but lacks the same level of thoughtful engagement. Although Essay B is a strong piece of work with a clear method and relevant background, Essay A's superior detail, justification of method, and comprehensive risk assessment make it the stronger of the two.",
