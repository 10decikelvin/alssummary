  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior mastery of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is exceptionally detailed and focused, specifying the independent variable's range, the dependent variable, the method of analysis, and the chemical system. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is good but lacks the same level of specificity, particularly regarding the measurement technique.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is more chemically sophisticated and directly relevant, explaining concepts like chelation, ion exchange, and the specific functional groups in pectin responsible for biosorption. Crucially, it justifies the choice of an acidic pH range by referencing chemical principles: \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4, due to the increased presence of OH\u207b ions in water. With the solubility product ( Ksp) of Cu(OH)\u2082 being 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079...a slight addition of OH\u207b ions would favour the product's formation.\" Essay A's background is adequate but less advanced.\n\nMethodologically, both are strong, but Essay B's inclusion of a \"Preliminary Trials\" section to justify choices like adsorption time and pH range demonstrates a more rigorous and scientific approach to experimental design. Essay A presents a well-controlled experiment with good use of technology, but its procedure lacks this element of refinement based on prior testing. While Essay A has a slightly more detailed risk assessment, especially its unique ethical consideration of using \"edible materials\", Essay B's superiority in the core scientific aspects\u2014the research question, depth of background chemistry, and refined methodology\u2014makes it the stronger piece of work overall. Essay B's handling of variables is also exemplary, with clear justifications for each control.",
