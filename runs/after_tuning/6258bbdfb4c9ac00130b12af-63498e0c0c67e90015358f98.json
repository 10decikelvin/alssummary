  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and are strong in their core scientific design, but Essay A is superior due to its comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements. Essay A presents a well-defined research question that specifies the independent variable range directly: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C)...\" Its methodology is detailed, and the controlled variables are well-justified. Essay B also has a strong, focused research question: \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\" and its methodology, including a proper calibration experiment, is appropriate.\n\nHowever, the key difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A excels here, providing a detailed safety table with specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and corresponding precautions. It also explicitly addresses ethics, stating, \"There were no ethical issues in this investigation... But oil which was used... was not either wasted or used in excess,\" and environmental impact, noting, \"Prepared chemicals such as KOH and HCl are poisonous... All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's coverage is critically lacking. Its safety section is brief, mentioning only that chemicals \"could cause skin and nasal irritations\" and that a \"Lab coat and gloves were worn.\" More importantly, it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. For an experimental investigation involving chemical preparation and disposal, this is a significant flaw. While Essay B's scientific content is solid, Essay A's thorough and complete approach to all aspects of the exploration, especially the detailed risk assessment, makes it the stronger submission.",
