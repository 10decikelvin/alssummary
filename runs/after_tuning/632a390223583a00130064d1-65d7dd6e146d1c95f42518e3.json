  "reasoning": "The topic being tested in the investigation from the first submission is clear: the effect of menthol concentration on the electrical conductivity of water. However, the exact reason for the experiment is a bit difficult to understand. The student claims that \u201cIt is important to investigate and understand how different concentrations of menthol affect the conductivity of water to ensure its safe and effective application in various industrial and commercial products.\u201d But the connection between this investigation and the real world application is lacking. The hypothesis of the student is also not clearly stated but is implied when the student writes \u201cThe change in conductivity of water upon addition of ment-hol is going to be determined\u201d. The procedure is logical, clear, and well-thought through as it describes the steps for the serial dilutions and the measurements in detail. The student has also made sure to include both independent and dependent variables as well as control variables. However, the student does not address the safety concerns that may be associated with the experiment. \n\nThe student in the second sample clearly states the research question: \u201chow does temperature affect the amount of time it takes to dissolve an effervescent tablet in water?\u201d Additionally, they offer a very detailed background of all the scientific concepts that are relevant to this investigation along with diagrams. This detail also extends to the hypothesis and variables, all of which are thoroughly thought out. The procedure for the experiment is well-detailed and easy to follow as well. Additionally, the student provides the specific safety precautions taken for the experiment. This includes: wearing safety goggles to avoid the solution splashing into the eyes. The student also mentions wearing gloves and a lab coat to avoid any of the solution from coming into contact with their skin. Finally, the student makes sure to include clean up procedures in the method to dispose of the materials properly. Overall, the second research paper is better because of the detail it gives as well as their acknowledgment of safety procedures.",
