  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior fulfillment of Criterion B due to its exceptionally detailed and focused research question and its thorough, context-specific consideration of all experimental aspects. Essay A's research question is exemplary: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (kJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\" This question precisely defines the independent variable (specific ions and their radii), the dependent variable (d-orbital splitting energy with units), and the specific measurement technique, demonstrating a high level of planning. In contrast, Essay B's research questions, while clear (\"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\"), lack this level of specificity regarding the range of alcohols or evaluation methods.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A, as an experimental investigation, correctly includes detailed and relevant safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. For example, its environmental consideration states, \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life and is considered a pollutant \u2014 Only use necessary amount... and use in low concentrations,\" and its ethical point addresses proper disposal: \"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin.\" Essay B, being a data-based investigation, correctly omits these, but Essay A's successful inclusion demonstrates a more comprehensive engagement with the scientific process. Finally, Essay A's identification of controlled variables (ligand type, oxidation state, concentration, geometry) is more extensive and detailed than Essay B's, which primarily controls for \"linear primary alcohols.\" While Essay B outlines a competent data-based study, Essay A's depth in its research question, methodology, and handling of experimental considerations makes it the stronger submission.",
