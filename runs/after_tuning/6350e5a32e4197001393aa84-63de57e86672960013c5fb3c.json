  "reasoning": "Essay B is the superior submission as it demonstrates a much higher level of detail, specificity, and thoughtful planning across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its exceptionally clear and focused research question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" This question is a model of clarity, specifying the exact range for the independent variable and a key controlled variable (time). In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen...?\", is functional but lacks this level of operational detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its methodology and control of variables. It not only identifies crucial controlled variables like the \"Distance between the electrodes\" but also provides a clear, practical method for managing them: \"using a wooden splint placed across the beaker... marked with either end of the beaker to ensure the same distance between the electrodes in each trial.\" Essay A identifies its variables correctly but the methodology is less focused, as it combines an investigation into salinity with a comparison of two analytical methods (\"I will also use the data to determine which of the two methods is the most accurate\"). This dual purpose makes the experimental design less streamlined than Essay B's singular, well-defined objective.\n\nBoth essays provide relevant background information and appropriate safety, ethical, and environmental considerations for their respective experimental investigations. Essay A gives a solid explanation of the Winkler Method chemistry. However, Essay B's background is more compelling by linking a personal interest to the scientific principles and citing multiple previous studies. Essay B's environmental considerations are also notably thorough, offering specific disposal methods like neutralizing sulfuric acid \"with sodium carbonate.\" While Essay A also addresses disposal (\"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\"), Essay B's overall planning and precision, particularly in its research question and variable control, establish it as the stronger piece of work.",
