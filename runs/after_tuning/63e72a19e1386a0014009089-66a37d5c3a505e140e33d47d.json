  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for a scientific investigation. Essay B's research question, 'To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration...', is well-formulated, using evaluative language ('to what extent') and specifying the independent variables. Essay A's question, 'How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...', is equally strong due to its high level of specificity regarding the concentrations. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly stronger grasp of the underlying chemistry in its background section, clearly explaining concepts like the 'salting out effect' and providing relevant chemical equations. Furthermore, its methodology and variable control are impeccable, correctly identifying temperature, pressure, and reagent concentrations as key controls. While Essay B also does a good job, it incorrectly lists 'Type of juice' as a controlled variable when it is in fact a second independent variable. Finally, while Essay B commendably includes an ethical consideration regarding food waste, Essay A's safety and environmental sections are more specific to the chemical hazards and disposal protocols required in a laboratory setting, which is arguably more critical for this type of investigation.",
