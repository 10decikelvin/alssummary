  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally superior due to the sophistication of its methodological development.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-focused and detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". The background information is highly relevant, explaining complex concepts like the Photo-Fenton reaction and the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2\" that directly inform the experimental design. The most significant strength of Essay A is its \"Preliminary Trials\" section. This section explicitly details how the methodology was refined, stating, \"during preliminary trials, aliquots were pipetted out every 15 minutes... It was observed that there was a major change between the first reading... and the second... Hence, aliquots were subsequently pipetted out every 4 minutes\". This demonstrates a sophisticated, iterative approach to experimental design, which is a hallmark of excellent scientific exploration. Safety and environmental considerations are also specific, noting the need for \"googles... when the UV-Lamp was in operation\" and that chemicals were \"disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\".\n\nEssay B also presents an excellent, detailed research question: \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L)... measured through Winkler\u2019s titration?\". The background provides a solid theoretical basis using intermolecular forces and kinetic theory, and the methodology is appropriate and detailed. Essay B's handling of variables is meticulous, and its coverage of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is exemplary, using a clear table and explicitly stating that \"No pertinent ethical considerations for this experiment exist.\"\n\nUltimately, Essay A is judged to be better. While Essay B's presentation of safety and ethical considerations is slightly more thorough, Essay A's inclusion of preliminary trials demonstrates a superior scientific process. This refinement of the methodology based on initial empirical findings showcases a deeper level of engagement with the investigation itself, making the overall exploration more robust and scientifically mature. This advanced methodological development is more critical to the core of Criterion B than the minor omissions in Essay A's S/E/E section.",
