  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior due to its exceptionally well-defined research question and a meticulously planned, justified, and detailed methodology for an experimental investigation. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", is a model of clarity and specificity, detailing the exact values and uncertainty of the independent variable and the precise metrics for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's research questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this high level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is outstanding. It includes a \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that justifies the use of a lux sensor, demonstrating thoughtful planning and problem-solving. Its table of control variables is comprehensive, explaining not just what is being controlled but also why and how. Essay A's methodology is appropriate for a data-based study, citing reliable sources like NIST, but it cannot demonstrate the same level of personal engagement and experimental design skill. Finally, as an experimental investigation, Essay B provides a thorough \"Safety, Environmental and Ethical Considerations\" section, identifying specific chemical hazards (\"Potassium bromate...is a strong oxidizer, toxic if swallowed\") and detailing mitigation strategies, including waste disposal (\"resulting solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\"). While Essay A is a solid data-based investigation, Essay B excels in every key aspect of Criterion B, showcasing a deeper and more rigorous approach to scientific exploration.",
