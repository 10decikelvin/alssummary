  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and rigorous approach to its experimental design, which is central to Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear and focused. Its primary strength lies in its detailed and well-justified control of variables. For instance, it identifies the need to control the \"Source of E10\" because \"E10 fuel in Australia contains anywhere from 9-10% ethanol\" and outlines a clear procedure for this: \"By purchasing all of the E10 (500ml) off of the same gas station in the same purchase\". This level of specific, thoughtful control is superior. Furthermore, the methodology includes a clear serial dilution table and justification for the range of concentrations chosen, linking it to real-world context (\"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia...\").\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How do different active ingredients...in different brands of indigestion tablets...compare in the volume (cm3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise...?\", is highly specific and well-formulated. The background information is relevant, and the methodology is appropriate. However, its handling of variables is weaker than Essay A's. The decision not to control the mass of the tablet, explained as \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet,\" introduces a significant uncontrolled variable that complicates a fair comparison of the active ingredients' effectiveness. While both essays correctly address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific details (Essay A: \"conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\"; Essay B: \"handling strong acids like HCl\"), Essay A's superior rigor in establishing a controlled experimental environment makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
