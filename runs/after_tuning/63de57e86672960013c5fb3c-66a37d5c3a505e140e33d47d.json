  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations, but Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to Criterion B, particularly regarding environmental considerations and justification for its variables.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally clear and detailed: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" This specificity sets a strong foundation. The methodology is robust, with clear controls for variables like the \"Distance between the electrodes\" using a \"wooden splint placed across the beaker.\" A key strength is the justification for the independent variable range, where the author states they will explore the advised \"2 to 6 volts\" but also \"challenged to see if higher voltages are more appropriate.\" The most significant advantage for Essay A lies in its comprehensive safety, ethical, and environmental section. It correctly identifies chemical hazards like \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084)\" and, crucially, provides specific environmental disposal instructions: \"the acid must be neutralized first then disposed of. Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate.\"\n\nEssay B also features an excellent, focused research question: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\" Its background information on the redox chemistry is detailed and relevant. The methodology is appropriate, and its ethical consideration regarding food waste (\"the least possible amount of fruits was used... to minimize the waste\") is thoughtful and specific to the experiment. However, Essay B's Criterion B is weakened by a significant omission in its environmental considerations. The only point raised is that the \"heating plate used... was powered off and unplugged when it was not used,\" completely failing to address the disposal of chemical waste such as the iodine solution. This is a critical oversight in an experimental chemistry investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, while both essays are of high quality, Essay A is superior. Its comprehensive treatment of all aspects of experimental design, especially the specific and correct procedures for environmental waste disposal, showcases a more complete and responsible scientific approach compared to Essay B's notable omission in this area.",
