  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it demonstrates a more thorough and detailed approach to the scientific process, particularly in its research question and experimental design. While both essays are well-structured, Essay A excels in specificity. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is highly specific, defining the exact range of the independent variable and a key controlled variable (time). In contrast, Essay B's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A presents a robust experimental methodology appropriate for its question. The control of variables is exemplary, with detailed explanations for managing factors like \"The surface area of the electrodes\" and \"Distance between the electrodes\". For example, it specifies that \"a wooden splint placed across the beaker acting as an electrochemical cell, it is easy to discern the distance between the two electrodes.\" Essay B, being a data-based investigation, appropriately identifies its control (\"including only linear primary alcohols\") and sources, but the experimental design demonstrated in Essay A shows a higher level of engagement with practical scientific challenges.\n\nFinally, Essay A fulfills all aspects of Criterion B for an experimental investigation by including a comprehensive risk assessment. It provides specific safety precautions (\"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive...wear gloves, a lab coat, and a pair of safety glasses\"), explicitly addresses ethical considerations, and details environmental impact and disposal procedures (\"Before disposing it, the acid must be neutralized first then disposed of.\"). Essay B, as a data-based study, does not require this, but its complete omission of these sections makes Essay A a more complete and well-rounded submission according to the IB criteria for its chosen investigation type. Essay B is a strong data-based study, but Essay A's detailed, specific, and complete experimental plan makes it the better example of Criterion B.",
