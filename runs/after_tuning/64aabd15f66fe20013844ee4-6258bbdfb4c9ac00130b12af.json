  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is highly specific, outlining a quantitative independent variable range and two complex dependent variables. In contrast, Essay A's question is clear but simpler, using a categorical variable. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology, involving reflux and two separate titration procedures, is sophisticated and well-justified, whereas Essay A's chosen method has a critical flaw which it acknowledges: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH,\" compromising the validity of the results for measuring *ascorbic acid* specifically.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify variables, Essay B's control is more comprehensive, considering factors like \"Moisture\" and \"Microbial Contamination.\" The most significant difference, however, lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are mandatory for experimental work. Essay B provides an exemplary \"Risk Assessment and safety issues\" table detailing multiple specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"Hazardous liquids (HCl, KOH),\" alongside dedicated paragraphs addressing ethical and environmental disposal. Essay A's consideration is critically insufficient, with minimal safety notes (\"Gloves are not necessary...\") and a complete omission of any ethical or environmental discussion, which is a major flaw. Overall, Essay B's exploration is more rigorous, complex, and aligned with IB expectations.",
