  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong examples of IB Chemistry Criterion B work, but Essay A demonstrates a slightly more comprehensive and personal exploration.\n\nEssay A's research question is highly specific and focused: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This clearly outlines the independent variable with precise values, the dependent variables, and the method of measurement. The background is thorough, explaining the BZ reaction, collision theory, and reaction mechanisms, effectively justifying the investigation. The \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section is a significant strength, detailing the trial-and-error process of selecting the right equipment (rejecting visual observation and a colorimeter in favor of a lux sensor), which showcases genuine engagement and exploration. The variables are presented in a clear table with methods for control, and the safety and environmental considerations are specific, including not only disposal but also the thoughtful reduction in the scale of the experiment to minimize waste.\n\nEssay B also features an excellent, specific research question: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". The background information is highly relevant, providing detailed chemical principles like the Beer-Lambert law, the chemistry of chromophores, and a full explanation of the titration needed to determine the initial bleach concentration. The inclusion of a detailed \"Pre-Test\" section is a major strength, demonstrating methodical planning. Its safety section, with a detailed table of hazards and precautions, is exemplary.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior due to its deeper demonstration of the exploratory process. The explicit discussion of failed attempts and subsequent methodological adaptations (\"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately, through using a data logger... I found that the built-in lux sensor... could determine the changes in colour\") provides a clearer narrative of scientific investigation than Essay B's pre-test. Furthermore, Essay A's investigation of the BZ reaction is more complex and less standard than a bleach kinetics lab, indicating a higher level of personal initiative. While both are excellent, Essay A's transparent account of overcoming methodological challenges gives it the edge in fulfilling the spirit of the \"Exploration\" criterion.",
