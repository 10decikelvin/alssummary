  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its significantly more sophisticated and scientifically rigorous approach to the investigation. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused and sets the stage for a thorough exploration of chemical kinetics. The background section of Essay B is exemplary; it doesn't just define terms but derives the necessary mathematical relationships, such as the integrated second-order rate law (`\\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t`), which directly informs the methodology and data processing. This demonstrates a deep, personal engagement with the underlying theory. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is complex yet appropriate, and its identification of variables is precise, including a clear justification for the temperature intervals chosen.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a competent but more standard investigation. Its research question, \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume... of 1M HCl they can neutralise...?\", is clear but less focused on a core chemical principle. While the background information is relevant, it is largely definitional. A significant weakness in Essay A is its handling of variables; the student states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet,\" which fundamentally flaws the experimental design for a fair comparison of effectiveness. Both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. However, the superior theoretical foundation, methodological complexity, and rigorous variable control in Essay B make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
