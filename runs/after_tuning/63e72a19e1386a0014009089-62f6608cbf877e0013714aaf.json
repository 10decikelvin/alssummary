  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. Essay A is commended for its exceptionally specific research question, which includes the precise range and uncertainty of the independent variable: \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...\". The background provides a clear explanation of the 'salting out' effect, and the methodology, variables, and safety precautions are well-organized and detailed. However, Essay B demonstrates a slightly greater depth of scientific engagement. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", leads to a more complex investigation. The background section is particularly strong, as it not only presents the relevant Arrhenius equation but also derives the integrated rate law for the reaction: \"\u222b(c\u2080 to c) -1/c\u00b2 dc = \u222b(0 to t) k dt\", linking theoretical kinetics directly to the planned data processing. While Essay A's safety table is more visually organized, Essay B's discussion of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is still specific and sufficient. Ultimately, Essay B is superior because its theoretical foundation and the complexity of its proposed experimental design reflect a deeper understanding of chemical principles.",
