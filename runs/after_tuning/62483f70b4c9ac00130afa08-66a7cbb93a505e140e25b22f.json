  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations with clear research questions and methodologies. Essay B's research question is commendable for its specificity, stating: \"How do different active ingredients (calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, and aluminium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate) in different brands of indigestion tablets (antacids A, B, and C) compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\". However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of exploration, starting with its more sophisticated, evaluative research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\".\n\nThe primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally thorough background research, which not only provides relevant scientific context (Le Chatelier's Principle) but also critically evaluates three distinct methodologies\u2014colorimetric, sensor-based, and the Winkler method\u2014before justifying the final choice. This comparative analysis demonstrates a deeper level of inquiry that directly informs the research question. While Essay B provides a solid and focused background with the necessary chemical equations, it lacks this comparative depth.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology and safety considerations are slightly more detailed. It explicitly mentions insights from preliminary trials, such as how to collect the water sample \"as not to aerate the water,\" which indicates thoughtful planning. Its safety assessment is also more specific, listing individual hazards for multiple chemicals (e.g., \"Alkali-iodide-azide \u2013 Very corrosive,\" \"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive\"), whereas Essay B's safety advice is more general (\"handling strong acids like HCl\"). While both essays correctly identify variables and address all safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay A's comprehensive exploration and meticulous planning from background research through to safety protocols make it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
