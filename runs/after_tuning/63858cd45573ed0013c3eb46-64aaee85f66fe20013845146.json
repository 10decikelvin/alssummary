  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations. Essay A is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is significantly stronger. It is framed as a focused, analytical question: \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\" This clearly outlines the relationship being investigated. In contrast, Essay B's research question is framed as a topic: \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea... using dichloromethane in a separating funnel,\" which is descriptive rather than investigative.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay A is more scientifically rigorous and directly relevant. It explains the core concepts of catalysis, including heterogeneous catalysis and the function of \"active sites,\" providing a strong theoretical foundation for the experiment. Essay B provides background on dichloromethane and caffeine, but it fails to adequately explain the chemical principles behind solvent extraction, which is the core technique of its methodology.\n\nThird, while both methodologies are appropriate, Essay A shows greater personal engagement and attention to controlling variables. For example, the justification for controlling the surface area of the MnO\u2082 is detailed: \"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a thoughtful approach to potential sources of error.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is a major point of differentiation. Essay A provides a comprehensive assessment, addressing specific chemical hazards (\"3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution was used\"), explicitly stating there are \"no evident ethical considerations,\" and detailing environmental protocols (\"Manganese dioxide catalyst... collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\"). Essay B addresses safety precautions for dichloromethane but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical failure for an experiment using a hazardous organic solvent. This omission alone makes it significantly weaker than Essay A.",
