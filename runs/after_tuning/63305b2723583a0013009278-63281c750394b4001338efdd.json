  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a stronger understanding and execution of the scientific process outlined in Criterion B.\n\nThe research question in Essay A, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is more focused and detailed than Essay B's \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\". Essay A clearly specifies the independent variable and its range, a key controlled variable (time), and the dependent variable, making the scope of the investigation immediately clear. Essay B's question is good, but lacks this level of specific detail.\n\nThe background information in both is relevant, but Essay A's is more thorough. It not only explains the principles of electrolysis but also introduces Faraday's Laws with the specific equation, which directly allows for a theoretical prediction to compare against the experimental results. Essay B's background is adequate, explaining specific heat capacity and using an analogy to NaCl solutions, but it is less comprehensive.\n\nFor the methodology, both are well-structured. However, Essay A's inclusion of a labeled diagram of the experimental setup is a strength. Furthermore, its discussion of controlled variables is more convincing. For example, stating that five solutions were combined \"to ensure that the concentration of electrolyte is the same in all of the trials\" shows a better consideration of potential errors than Essay B's simpler \"Distilled water will be used for all the trials.\"\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay A is more specific. It identifies the exact hazards of the chemicals used (e.g., \"fumes of zinc sulphate heptahydrate may cause respiratory irritation\") and details the specific disposal methods (\"disposed as a hazardous waste,\" \"batteries were recycled\"). Essay B's safety precautions are more generic (\"Wear rubber gloves...in case a naked wire is touched\"), and its environmental consideration (\"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\") lacks specific detail about the nature of the waste or the proper disposal procedure.\n\nOverall, Essay A's research question is more focused, its background is more detailed and linked to the hypothesis, and its handling of variables and safety/environmental issues is more specific and thorough.",
