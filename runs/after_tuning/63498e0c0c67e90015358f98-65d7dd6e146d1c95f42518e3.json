  "reasoning": "The research question in Option B, 'To what extent does the temperature affect the rate of reaction between sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid?', is more focused and scientifically sound than the one in Option A, 'How does the concentration of NaCl affect the germination of lettuce seeds?'. While both are clear, Option A's DV (number of seeds germinated) is not specific enough. The methodology of both experiments seems appropriate for their respective research questions. Option B clearly lists independent, dependent and controlled variables, whereas Option A fails to identify any variables. The safety, ethics and environment section in Option A is very brief and generic, with a simple warning: \"Wear goggles and handle the acid with care.\" In contrast, Option B provides a more detailed risk assessment table, including specifics like 'wear safety goggles' and 'handle the acid with care as it is an irritant'. In terms of structure, both options are well-organized. Overall, due to the clearer identification of variables and a more comprehensive safety section, Option B is the stronger choice.",
