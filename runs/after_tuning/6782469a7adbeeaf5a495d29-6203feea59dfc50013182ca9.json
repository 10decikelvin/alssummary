  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused and specific research question, its scientifically rigorous background that directly informs the methodology, and its precise experimental design. Essay A's research question is exceptionally detailed, stating not only the variables but also the specific analytical technique and a precise concentration range: \"for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand...?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background provides a deep, relevant chemical context, discussing the Photo-Fenton reaction, the rate-determining step, and a \"scavenging effect\" which it uses to justify its chosen concentration range, showing a sophisticated link between theory and practice. Essay B's background explains BOD and the Winkler method but lacks the same depth or direct justification for its experimental choices. The methodology in Essay A is more rigorous, featuring precise serial dilutions for the independent variable and evidence of refinement from \"Preliminary Trials,\" which led to adjustments in concentration and sampling frequency. Essay B's methodology is less precise; for instance, it controls pH by \"adding 6 drops of HCl,\" which is not a robust method, and its temperature control relies on \"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard,\" a significant weakness for a biologically sensitive experiment.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety well, Essay A\u2019s environmental consideration, though brief, is more appropriate (\"disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\") than Essay B's, which suggests improper disposal (\"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\"). Although both essays neglect to explicitly mention ethical considerations, the cumulative strengths in the research question, background, and methodology make Essay A a much stronger example of exploration.",
