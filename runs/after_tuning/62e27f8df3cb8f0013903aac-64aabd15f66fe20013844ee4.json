  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly detailed and focused approach across all aspects of Criterion B, particularly in contrast to the significant omissions in Essay B. Essay A's research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC)...,\" is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining all variables, their ranges, and the precise measurement technique. Essay B's question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands in the market has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid...using acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\" is clear but lacks the same level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which shows a process of refinement and independent thought that is absent in Essay B's more standard titration procedure. The discussion of variables in Essay A is also more thorough, providing detailed justifications for controls. Most critically, the handling of safety and environmental considerations starkly separates the two essays. Essay A provides a detailed table outlining risks and mitigation for each specific chemical, stating, \"Dispose according to local legislation. Waste generation should be avoided by using the minimum volume required.\" In contrast, Essay B's safety section is dangerously dismissive (\"Gloves are not necessary for this experiment...\") and completely omits any mention of environmental impact or waste disposal, a major flaw for an experimental investigation. While Essay B is competent in its background and basic procedure, Essay A demonstrates a far higher level of rigor, depth, and adherence to scientific best practices.",
