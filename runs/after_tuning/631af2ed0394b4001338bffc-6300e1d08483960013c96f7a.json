  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is highly specific, focused, and sets the stage for a sophisticated chemical investigation. The background information is detailed and relevant, discussing complex topics like casein micelles and the chelation of ions, which directly justifies the chosen methodology. The methodology itself, a complexometric titration, is appropriate and well-described, and the consideration of variables is exceptional, including a table for both controlled and uncontrolled variables. Furthermore, Essay A includes a comprehensive risk assessment, explicitly addressing safety (\"Ammonia solution was handled with caution and only under a fume cupboard\"), environmental (\"The ammonia buffer solution can be toxic to the aquatic life...diluted with extensive quantities of water before disposal\"), and ethical considerations (\"No ethical concerns were identified\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is significantly weaker. While its research question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear, the investigation it proposes is fundamentally flawed. The background information is superficial, spending time defining basic concepts like anions and cations rather than exploring the thermodynamics of dissolution. The methodology is poorly designed for a controlled experiment; for example, it calls for placing ice cubes in \"bakers\" with no insulation, meaning ambient temperature would be a massive confounding variable, and it lacks specificity on how \"identical ice cubes\" will be ensured. Most critically, for an experimental investigation, Essay B completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major failure in this criterion. Therefore, Essay A's superior research focus, robust methodology, and complete fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements make it the clear winner.",
