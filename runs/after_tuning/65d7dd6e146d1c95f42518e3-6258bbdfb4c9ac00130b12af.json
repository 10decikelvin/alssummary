  "reasoning": "Both essays provide a strong framework for an investigation, but Essay A is superior due to its more detailed and well-defined methodology.  Essay B, while having a more concise and focused research question, offers a procedure that lacks specific quantities and steps, making replication difficult. For example, Essay B's procedure states \"Place a thin piece of potato... in a Petri dish with distilled water\" without specifying the volume of water or the mass/dimensions of the potato piece. In contrast, Essay A clearly outlines the preparation of a 0.1 M HCl solution by dissolving \"5.2g of HCl into 100 mL of distilled water\" and later specifies using \"25ml of the solution\" for titration. This level of detail in Essay A's procedure is crucial for scientific rigor and reproducibility. While Essay B's risk assessment is more thorough, covering potential cuts from glassware and allergies, the fundamental weakness in its experimental design makes it the weaker submission overall. Essay A also provides a more robust analysis plan, including calculations for mean and standard deviation, which are absent in Essay B.",
