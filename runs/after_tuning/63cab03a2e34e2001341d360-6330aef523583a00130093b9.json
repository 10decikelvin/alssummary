  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a more complete and thorough approach to Criterion B. Both essays present clear, focused, and well-contextualized research questions and background information. Essay A asks, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level... by using Winkler\u2019s method?\" and supports this with local context and the relevant chemical theory. Essay B's question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions... from enthalpy changes of precipitation reaction...\", is also well-framed and backed by strong theoretical explanations of thermochemistry.\n\nHowever, the essays diverge significantly in their handling of experimental design fundamentals. Essay A correctly and clearly identifies its variables, stating the independent variable is the \"4 different Water bodies\" (representing pollution levels) and the dependent variable is the \"Amount of Dissolved Oxygen\". In contrast, Essay B fundamentally misidentifies its variables. It lists the dependent variable as \"Different types of substances dissolved...\" and the independent variable as \"Temperature change...\", which is the reverse of the actual relationship. This is a critical error in demonstrating an understanding of the investigation's design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A provides a superior risk assessment. It details the specific hazards for each chemical used, such as for Potassium Dichromate: \"Very hazardous. Can cause cancer... Conduct the experiment in a fume hood.\" This is significantly more rigorous than Essay B's more generalized safety precautions like \"Lab coats and safety goggles must be worn at all times\". While Essay B's methodology is appropriate, the extensive evaluation section reveals that the chosen concentrations were too low to produce meaningful results, suggesting a flaw in the exploration and planning stage. Essay A's methodology, involving a multi-step titration with standardization, is both complex and well-described, showing a stronger overall execution of Criterion B.",
