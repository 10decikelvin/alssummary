  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally clear and focused research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\". This RQ is highly specific, identifying the precise values of the independent variable and the concentrations of reactants, setting a strong foundation for the investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question is confusing and contradictory: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\". This question incorrectly claims to use secondary data while the methodology is entirely experimental, and the independent variable (\"pollution level\") is qualitative and anecdotal, not scientifically measured.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background is scientifically rigorous and directly relevant, linking the investigation to Gibbs free energy, Le Chatelier's principle, and, most importantly, the Van't Hoff equation, which provides a direct theoretical framework for the experiment. Essay B's background is less focused, discussing broad international treaties and providing anecdotal descriptions of pollution rather than a deep chemical context, though it does correctly outline the chemistry of the Winkler method. In terms of methodology and variables, Essay A presents a logical, two-part procedure justified by preliminary experiments and includes an exemplary table of controlled variables with clear rationale and methods for control. While Essay B's chosen chemical procedure is appropriate, its overall experimental design is weakened by the poorly defined independent variable. Finally, while both essays provide strong safety considerations, Essay A is more thorough in its ethical and environmental sections, offering specific disposal advice (\"iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised\"), whereas Essay B's environmental statement is generic (\"Laboratory standards were followed\") and it completely omits any ethical considerations.",
