  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its superior coherence, a more focused research question, and stronger theoretical background, despite Essay A's more thorough risk assessment.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core foundation, Essay B presents a significantly stronger and more focused research question. Essay B asks, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\". This question is specific, detailing the independent variable (concentration), dependent variable (enthalpy change), and the exact quantities of reactants, demonstrating a clear and focused plan. In contrast, Essay A's research question is fundamentally flawed and contradictory: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes... by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\". This question incorrectly identifies the investigation as a \"secondary data\" comparison, while the entire methodology section details a primary data collection experiment. This internal contradiction undermines the focus and planning of the entire exploration. Furthermore, Essay B's background is more rigorous, including calculations for standard cell potential and Gibbs free energy to establish the reaction's feasibility, which is a higher level of chemical understanding than Essay A's more general background on pollution conventions.\n\nSecond, while both methodologies are appropriate for an experimental investigation, Essay B's methodology is directly aligned with its research question, creating a cohesive narrative. Essay A provides an exceptionally detailed procedure for the Winkler titration, which is a strength in terms of replicability. However, this detailed method directly contradicts the \"secondary data\" claim in its research question, highlighting a critical lack of focus. Both essays correctly identify their independent, dependent, and controlled variables.\n\nFinally, in the safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations, Essay A is much stronger. Its \"Risk Assessment\" is exemplary, listing specific hazards for each chemical, such as \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\" Essay B's S/E/E section is weak and contradictory; it claims environmental awareness (\"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways\") but then states in the safety section, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain,\" which is poor and unsafe laboratory practice. However, an exploration must be built on a coherent and focused research question. The fundamental disconnect in Essay A between its stated purpose and its actual procedure is a more significant failing than the poor S/E/E section in the otherwise well-structured and focused Essay B.",
