  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B. However, Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated and thorough methodology and its deeper engagement with the investigation's context.\n\nEssay A presents a very well-structured investigation. Its research question is clear and specific: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" The background information is relevant, linking personal interest to scientific principles like Faraday's law. The methodology is appropriate and replicable, and the variables are correctly identified with clear methods of control. Safety and environmental considerations are specific, with mentions of handling corrosive substances like H\u2082SO\u2084 and proper disposal of CuSO\u2084 solution.\n\nEssay B, however, exhibits a higher level of scientific engagement. Its research question is equally focused: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\" The methodology is notably more complex, involving not only the synthesis of the material but also the subsequent physical testing using specialized equipment (\"Vernier LabQuest 2...Tracker Software\"). The treatment of variables is exemplary; the essay not only lists controlled variables but presents them in a table detailing the method of control and, crucially, the \"Possible Effect on Results,\" demonstrating a deep understanding of experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B thoughtfully addresses an ethical consideration often overlooked in such experiments, stating, \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted.\" This level of reflection, combined with the identification of uncontrolled variables, places it ahead of Essay A.\n\nWhile Essay A is a very competent and well-executed plan for a standard electroplating experiment, Essay B's ambition, methodological rigor, and more nuanced consideration of variables and ethics make it the stronger piece of work.",
