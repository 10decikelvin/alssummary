  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a far more sophisticated and rigorous approach to a scientific investigation. The research question in Essay A is superior due to its specificity, clearly stating the independent variable's range and the reactants' concentrations: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". In contrast, Essay B's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is acceptable but lacks this level of quantitative detail. Furthermore, Essay A's background is deeply rooted in relevant chemical principles like Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and Beer-Lambert's law, creating a strong theoretical foundation for the experiment. Essay B's background on freezing point depression is relevant, but it fails to adequately connect the theory of a changing freezing *point* to the chosen dependent variable, which is the *volume* of melted ice over time (a rate).\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is far more robust. It includes preliminary experiments to refine the procedure, employs a two-part method involving a calibration curve, and specifies the precision of its equipment (e.g., \"5.00 cm\u00b3 (\u00b10.05 cm\u00b3) graduated pipette\"). The table of controlled variables is exhaustive and provides clear justification and methods for control. Essay B's methodology is simplistic and contains a critical uncontrolled variable; it calls for \"5 identical ice cubes\" but provides no method for ensuring they are identical in mass, surface area, or volume. Finally, Essay A excels in its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, providing specific chemical hazards (\"cyanide gas\"), precautions (\"Wearing protective gloves\"), and disposal instructions (\"need to be neutralised\"). Essay B completely omits this section, which is a critical failure for an experimental investigation.",
