  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work, but Essay A demonstrates a more thoroughly considered and robust experimental design, making it superior for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations to be tested and the method of measurement. Essay B's question is also strong and specific. However, Essay A's background and methodology showcase superior preparatory work. The author proactively identified that the commercial bleach concentration was unknown and designed a full titration (\"Pre-Test\") to determine it, explaining the complex redox chemistry involved. This demonstrates a higher level of experimental planning and foresight.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B's background is theoretically sound, its methodology contains significant, unaddressed assumptions that undermine its validity, as acknowledged in its own evaluation. For instance, the author notes that for two of the metals, the color change was likely due to oxidation, not the intended ligand exchange, stating, \"the color change resulting from the addition of ammonia hydroxide cannot be attributed to a ligand exchange.\" Furthermore, it assumes an octahedral geometry for all complexes, but later admits the copper complex is likely square planar, which fundamentally alters the d-orbital splitting being measured. These are critical flaws in the experimental design that a preliminary investigation might have revealed.\n\nBoth essays correctly identify variables and detail their control methods effectively in tables. Essay A\u2019s safety section is exemplary, presented in a clear \"Safety Data Sheet\" format that details hazards and emergency actions for each specific chemical. Essay B also addresses safety, environmental, and ethical concerns, but Essay A\u2019s meticulous approach to determining its reactant concentration and its more robust experimental plan give it a clear edge in demonstrating a well-considered and controlled scientific investigation.",
