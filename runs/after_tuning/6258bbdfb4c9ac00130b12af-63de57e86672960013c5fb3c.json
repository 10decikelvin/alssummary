  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of proficiency for Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally better due to its exceptional articulation of the experimental design. Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is focused, clear, and highly specific. Essay A's question, while also specific, is slightly less concise. However, Essay A excels in its treatment of variables; its table of controlled variables, which includes columns for \"How to control?\" and \"Why to control?\", is a model of clarity and demonstrates a deep understanding of experimental design. For example, it explains for microbial contamination that \"Oil samples were kept sealed until brought into use\" because \"If contamination increased free fatty acid content will also increase.\" Essay B discusses its controlled variables well, but Essay A's tabular format is superior. Furthermore, Essay A includes a dedicated \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains choices like temperature range and chemical concentrations, adding a layer of critical thought not explicitly present in Essay B. While Essay B has a slightly more detailed background and a stronger environmental considerations section, Essay A's meticulously planned and justified methodology and its outstanding variable control table make it a slightly stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
