  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A based on Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B is its exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed research question: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". This RQ precisely defines the scope, variables, range, and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's RQ is convoluted and contradictory, stating it will compare \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\".\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background is highly focused, logically building the theoretical framework (Beer-Lambert law, rate laws, Arrhenius equation) necessary to answer its specific research question. Essay A's background is relevant but less focused, and its independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is defined qualitatively rather than quantitatively, weakening the experimental design. Essay B's methodology is also superior, justified by a \"Preliminary Testing\" section that demonstrates refinement of the procedure. While Essay A's methodology is detailed, particularly the titration steps, the overall experimental design is flawed due to the poorly defined independent variable.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide good safety assessments, Essay B integrates specific environmental disposal instructions for each chemical in its safety table (e.g., \"Do not wash down the sink as it may be hazardous to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\"). Essay A offers only a generic sentence: \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals...\". Essay B's comprehensive approach to all aspects of the exploration\u2014from the foundational research question to the detailed consideration of variables and safety\u2014makes it the clear winner.",
