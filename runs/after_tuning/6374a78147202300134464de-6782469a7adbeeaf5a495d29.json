  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across nearly all aspects of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the quality and specificity of the research question and the depth of the supporting background information. Essay B's research question is exemplary: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2 in the degradation of Methyl Orange, in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light, through the use of Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometry (UV-Vis), for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". It is focused, detailed, and specifies the independent variable range, the method of analysis (UV-Vis), and the conditions (365nm UV Light). In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks the critical detail of the concentration range being tested.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background is comprehensive, relevant, and demonstrates significant research, citing literature to explain the Photo-Fenton reaction, the scavenging effect of H2O2, and explicitly identifying a research gap: \"There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts.\" Essay A's background is adequate but far less focused and in-depth. Methodologically, Essay B shows a much higher level of design, including justification for its concentration range and evidence of refinement through \"Preliminary Trials\" which led to procedural adjustments. While Essay A's methodology is appropriate, it is a standard procedure with little justification for the chosen parameters.\n\nFinally, Essay B's approach to safety and environmental considerations is more responsible. It states that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC,\" which is a far better practice than Essay A's admission to having \"disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain.\" Essay A does explicitly address ethical considerations by stating they are not applicable, which Essay B omits, but this minor point does not outweigh the profound differences in scientific rigor, depth, and design evident in Essay B.",
