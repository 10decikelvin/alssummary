  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, the research question and background information in Essay B are of a much higher caliber. Essay B's title functions as a highly specific research question: \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created.\" This is far more detailed than Essay A's simpler question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\". Furthermore, Essay B's background engages with existing scientific literature, citing \"Toyosaki et al.\" and identifying a research gap concerning \"model foods,\" which demonstrates a sophisticated approach to scientific inquiry. Essay A's background correctly explains freezing point depression but remains at a textbook level without similar academic engagement.\n\nSecond, the methodology and control of variables are vastly superior in Essay B. The procedure is complex, involving the preparation of a specific phosphate buffer and the extraction of AGEs for colorimetric analysis. The controlled variables are listed in a comprehensive table with detailed justifications, such as how \"a slight variation in temperature or cooking time... could change the rate of reaction.\" In contrast, Essay A's methodology has a significant flaw; the instructions \"Repeat steps 11-12 for KCl\" and subsequent salts imply a sequential procedure rather than simultaneous trials, which directly contradicts its stated controlled variable of \"Surrounding temperature and pressure.\"\n\nFinally, Essay B correctly addresses safety considerations for an experimental investigation, whereas Essay A completely fails to do so. Essay B includes a \"Risk Assessment\" section that identifies specific hazards and mitigation strategies, such as using \"Heat-proof gloves... while handling oven equipment.\" Essay A, despite being an experimental investigation, makes no mention of any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a critical omission for this criterion. The combination of a more advanced scientific topic, a rigorous and well-controlled methodology, and the inclusion of a required risk assessment makes Essay B the clear winner.",
