  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the fundamental principles of experimental design required for Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its well-defined research question: \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\". This question is focused, specific about quantities, and clearly establishes the relationship to be investigated. Furthermore, Essay B correctly identifies its variables, stating, \"Independent variable Concentration... Dependent variable Change in temperature,\" which is crucial for a sound methodology. Essay B also excels by explicitly and individually addressing safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, correctly noting for ethics that \"I took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay A, while ambitious, contains a critical flaw in its experimental design. It incorrectly identifies its variables, stating the \"Dependent\" variable is \"Different types of substances dissolved in water\" and the \"Independent\" variable is \"Temperature change,\" which is the reverse of their actual roles. This fundamental error undermines the quality of the exploration. Additionally, Essay A completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, failing to meet a key requirement of the criterion. While Essay A's background on thermochemistry is relevant, Essay B's background is more focused and impressive, using Gibbs free energy calculations to justify the reaction's feasibility. Therefore, Essay B's clear and correct methodology and complete fulfillment of the S/E/E requirements make it significantly better.",
