  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays provide a clear research question and background, though Essay A's inclusion of a specific chemical reaction (`C2H5OH + 3O2 \u2192 2CO2 + 3H2O`) slightly enhances its detail. Essay B's research question, 'What is the correlation between the boiling point and the number of carbon atoms in the first 8 alkanes?', is clear but could be more specific about the source of data. Both essays correctly identify the independent and dependent variables. However, Essay A demonstrates a significantly more thorough understanding of controlled variables, as evidenced by its detailed table outlining these variables and the methods to control them. In contrast, Essay B simply lists controlled variables without explaining their potential impact or control methods. Furthermore, Essay A's inclusion of a detailed safety assessment, with specific risks and handling procedures like using a fume hood and proper disposal methods, makes its methodology more robust and appropriate for a practical investigation. Essay B's risk assessment is generic and lacks specific details, stating only 'Follow lab safety rules...'. Therefore, based on the superior detail and rigour in its experimental design and safety considerations, Essay A is the stronger submission.",
