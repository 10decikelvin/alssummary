  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a stronger grasp of the fundamental principles of experimental design, particularly concerning variables. Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is well-formulated for a scientific investigation. It correctly identifies the variables, stating the \"Independent variable in this research is the concentration of the potassium nitrate solution and the dependent variable will be the temperature difference after heating the solution.\" Furthermore, Essay B explicitly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, noting correctly for ethics that \"I did not use any materials from living organisms therefore there were no ethical precautions needed.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay A contains a critical flaw in its experimental design. It incorrectly identifies its variables, stating the \"Dependent: Different types of substances dissolved...\" and \"Independent: Temperature change...\". This represents a fundamental misunderstanding, as the temperature change is what is being measured (dependent) in response to the different reactions being conducted (independent). While Essay A has an ambitious research question and provides good theoretical background with detailed Hess's Law cycle diagrams, this major conceptual error in the variables section significantly weakens its quality. Essay A's safety precautions are specific and well-detailed (\"Silver nitrate should be stored in sealed containers... It has strong oxidizing properties\"), but it fails to explicitly address ethical considerations at all. Therefore, Essay B's solid and correct foundation in experimental design makes it the better essay.",
