  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to the exploration criterion. Its research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is highly specific, detailing the exact range of the independent variable and the precise measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, while Essay B's question is clear, Essay A's methodological design is more robust and appropriate. Essay B's methodology has a critical flaw, which the student acknowledges: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid.\" This compromises the validity of the entire investigation, as the titration cannot isolate the target analyte. Essay A's electroplating method, however, is directly suited to its research question without such confounding variables.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its treatment of controlled variables and safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations. It thoroughly explains how variables like \"Distance between the electrodes\" will be controlled using a marked wooden splint. Its S/E/E section is exemplary for an experimental investigation, providing specific hazards and disposal methods, such as neutralizing sulfuric acid: \"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate\". Essay B's handling of these aspects is critically weak. It dismisses safety precautions, stating, \"Gloves are not necessary for this experiment due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH Titre,\" which is poor practice. Crucially, Essay B entirely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a significant failure for an experimental IA. While both essays have well-structured backgrounds and variables, Essay A's superior methodological validity and comprehensive S/E/E analysis make it the better submission.",
