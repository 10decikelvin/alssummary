  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its exceptionally focused research question and a more rigorous experimental design process. Essay B's research question is a model of precision, stating: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This level of detail, including concentrations, variable ranges, and measurement specifics, demonstrates a clear and thorough understanding of the investigation's scope. In contrast, while Essay A's research question is clear, it is less specific about the methodology. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies the chosen temperature range and procedural modifications, showcasing a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. Essay A presents a solid methodology and excellent, comprehensive background information on milk chemistry; however, its reliance on manufacturer's labels for the independent variable introduces an uncontrolled element that is not present in Essay B's highly controlled experiment. Both essays have excellent variable tables and strong safety considerations. However, Essay A is slightly better in this specific area as it explicitly addresses all three considerations separately, stating \"No ethical concerns were identified,\" whereas Essay B omits a direct statement on ethics. Despite this minor point, Essay B's superior research question and demonstrated methodological refinement make it the stronger example of scientific exploration.",
