  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all evaluated aspects of Criterion B. The primary difference lies in the level of detail, specificity, and completeness. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen (mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", is a model of clarity and focus; it specifies the exact ranges of the independent variables and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B presents a comprehensive methodology that is detailed, replicable, and includes justifications for the chosen technique (Winkler's titration) over alternatives. Essay A explains the theory behind its titration but provides no step-by-step procedure for the experiment. This is a critical omission. The treatment of variables is another area of stark contrast. Essay B features an exemplary table detailing not only the independent, dependent, and controlled variables but also explaining *why* and *how* each variable is controlled (e.g., for atmospheric pressure, \"All procedures were conducted in the same lab...to ensure constant pressure\"). Essay A's variables section is incomplete in the provided text, representing a significant weakness.\n\nFinally, as both are experimental investigations, safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are mandatory. Essay B addresses these thoroughly in a dedicated table, outlining specific hazards for each chemical (\"Concentrated sulfuric acid | Extremely corrosive to all bodily tissue\") and corresponding disposal methods (\"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink.\"). Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a failing grade for this component in an experimental IA. While Essay A's background is relevant, it cannot compensate for the profound deficiencies in its experimental design and safety protocols compared to Essay B's thorough and well-structured exploration.",
