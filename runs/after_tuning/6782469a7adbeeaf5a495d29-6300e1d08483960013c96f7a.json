  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and detail across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally strong, being both focused and highly detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2... in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear but lacks the specificity of variables and conditions seen in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay A's background is deeply researched, referencing specific mechanisms like the \"Photo-Fenton reaction\" and identifying a clear \"research gap,\" whereas Essay B's background provides a much more general overview of freezing point depression without engaging with specific scientific literature.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A presents a sophisticated and appropriate plan using UV-Vis spectrometry, with an outstanding table of controlled variables that justifies and details the control method for each. For example, it explains that \"the amount of outside light\" must be controlled and this was achieved by using \"an opaque cardboard box... to cover the UV-lamp.\" Essay B's methodology is simple but flawed, as the procedure implies a sequential rather than concurrent experimental setup, compromising the control of ambient temperature. Most critically, Essay A, as a lab-based experiment, correctly includes specific safety (\"gloves and lab coats were worn when handling H2O2 and MO\") and environmental considerations (\"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\"). Essay B, also an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw. Overall, Essay A consistently displays the depth, precision, and thoroughness expected of a high-quality scientific exploration.",
