  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of quality for Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated chemical problem-solving and deeper personal engagement in the methodological development.\n\nEssay A presents a very strong and well-structured investigation. Its research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". The background is focused and relevant, the variables are comprehensively identified and justified, and the methodology includes thoughtful steps, such as centrifuging samples to remove precipitates (\"To counteract this, I centrifuged all the samples... and only used the remaining supernatant as the starting solution\"). All safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are explicitly and appropriately addressed.\n\nHowever, Essay B showcases a higher degree of scientific inquiry and intellectual initiative. The student identifies a significant analytical challenge\u2014that the analyte, Vitamin B6, is colorless and thus unsuitable for direct UV-vis analysis (\"when pyridoxine hydrochloride is dissolved in water, it forms a clear, colourless solution, meaning that it does not absorb any visible light\"). The essay then details the process of overcoming this, first by complexing the vitamin with copper(II) ions, and then by addressing the subsequent issue of precipitation by inducing micelle formation with SDS and Crystal Violet. This multi-step solution, detailed in the \"Development and pilot studies\" section, demonstrates a far more complex and personally engaged exploration than Essay A. While Essay A executes a standard procedure excellently, Essay B documents the creation of a novel and sophisticated procedure to answer its research question, which is the hallmark of outstanding exploration. The safety section is also more detailed, identifying specific risks for multiple reagents like \"SDS causes serious eye irritation and mild skin irritation, so gloves must be worn\".\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is a model of a well-executed experiment, Essay B's demonstration of identifying and systematically solving complex chemical hurdles makes it the better essay for Criterion B.",
