  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of a Criterion B section. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentration ratios to be tested: \"...concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity...\" This level of specificity is commendable. Its background section is also more comprehensive, discussing not only the basic concept of buffers but also the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and two different formulas for buffer capacity, directly linking the theory to the planned experiment. Essay B also has a strong, focused research question and a good background section with relevant chemical equations and justifications. However, Essay A's explanation of controlled variables is superior. For example, it explains *why* temperature affects the data ('affects the equilibrium constant') and how it will be monitored ('monitored vigilantly'). In contrast, Essay B's explanation for controlling the volume of HCl is weaker, simply stating 'If more HCl is added in one experiment, more iron may be dissolved'. While Essay B's consideration of chemical disposal is slightly more detailed and environmentally aware, the overall scientific rigor demonstrated in the background information and the meticulous planning shown in the variables section makes Essay A the stronger piece of work for this criterion.",
