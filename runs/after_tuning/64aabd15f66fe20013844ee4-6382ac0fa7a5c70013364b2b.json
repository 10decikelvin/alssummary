  "reasoning": "While both essays present viable investigations, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of exploration and thoroughness, particularly in its methodology and consideration of safety and environmental factors. Essay A's research question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands in the market has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid,\" is clear and focused. Its background information is relevant, and its table of variables is well-structured and accurately identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. However, its safety section is critically weak, incorrectly stating, \"Gloves are not necessary for this experiment due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH Titre,\" and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw for a lab-based experiment.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B undertakes a more ambitious investigation by comparing two distinct methodologies to answer its research question: \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate... as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\". This comparative approach adds a layer of complexity and evaluation. Although Essay B makes a minor error by misidentifying the \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable instead of the source of the sample, its overall quality is superior. The essay's \"HAZARDS, CONCERNS AND SAFETY\" section is comprehensive and specific, advising that \"it becomes essential to wear gloves and eye goggles\" when handling NaOH and to wear goggles when powdering samples. Crucially, it also includes a dedicated environmental consideration, stating that \"The excess HCl and sample solution were properly disposed of within the lab itself, since dumping them outside may affect soil pH, thereby disrupting the ecosystem.\" This thorough treatment of safety and environmental impact, combined with a more complex experimental design and strong personal context, makes Essay B a better example of the exploration criterion.",
