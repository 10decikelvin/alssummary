  "reasoning": "Both essays describe valid experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This level of detail, specifying exact temperatures and concentrations, is superior to Essay A's question, which is clear but less precise. The background information in Essay B is far more advanced and thorough, connecting the experiment to complex concepts like Gibbs free energy, Beer-Lambert's law, and the Van't Hoff equation. This contrasts with Essay A's background, which, while relevant, covers more fundamental concepts of neutralization.\n\nThe methodology and control of variables in Essay B are exceptionally rigorous. It employs a sophisticated two-part procedure involving a calibration curve and provides an extensive table of eight controlled variables with detailed justifications, such as controlling the \"Time mixture was left in the water bath\". Essay A's methodology is sound, but its decision to \"not be controlling the mass of the tablet\" is a notable weakness, introducing a confounding variable that Essay B avoids through meticulous control. Furthermore, Essay B's inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" to refine its method shows a deeper level of engagement and planning.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations as required for an experimental investigation, Essay B is again more comprehensive. It identifies specific chemical hazards, noting that for potassium thiocyanate, \"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas,\" and details specific disposal requirements, stating that waste needs to be \"neutralised\". Essay A's considerations are adequate but more generic, for example, \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\" Overall, Essay B's depth, rigor, and theoretical underpinning make it the clearly superior work.",
