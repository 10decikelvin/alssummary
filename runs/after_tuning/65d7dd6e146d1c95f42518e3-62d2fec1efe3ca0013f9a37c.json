  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay A's is more detailed. Essay B's question \"To what extent does the change of temperature affect the speed of the reaction with HCl?\" is somewhat vague, whereas Essay A specifies the reactant concentrations and the temperature range: \"how does changing the concentration of... potassium iodide and... hydrogen peroxide... while keeping the temperature constant... affect the rate of reaction?\". Furthermore, Essay A provides a more comprehensive explanation of the underlying chemical principles, including the relevant rate equations. While both describe their methods well, Essay A is superior in its explicit identification and justification of all variables\u2014independent, dependent, and controlled\u2014and includes a table detailing how each controlled variable will be managed. Essay B, while mentioning variables, is less thorough in this regard. Although neither essay explicitly addresses ethical considerations, both discuss safety, but Essay A's safety precautions are more specific and detailed. Therefore, Essay A is the stronger submission due to its more focused research question, more thorough theoretical background, and more rigorous experimental design.",
