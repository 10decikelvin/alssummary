  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. Essay A's research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created,\" is clear, focused, and supported by a relevant background on the Maillard reaction and colorimetry. Its methodology and control of variables are also strong, evidenced by the detailed table of controlled variables, such as \"Baking Temperature and Time\" and \"Buffer Solution pH Value\". However, its primary weakness lies in its incomplete handling of required considerations; while it includes a \"Risk Assessment\" for safety (\"Oven (High Temperatures): Heat-proof gloves were worn...\"), it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental impacts.\n\nEssay B demonstrates superior quality across all elements of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is exceptionally detailed and focused. The background information provides a thorough chemical foundation for the investigation, explaining complex formation and equilibria. Crucially, Essay B excels where Essay A falters by explicitly and thoroughly addressing all required considerations. It details specific safety measures (\"Ammonia solution was handled with caution and only under a fume cupboard\"), explicitly states its ethical position (\"No ethical concerns were identified...\"), and provides specific environmental protocols (\"The ammonia buffer solution can be toxic to the aquatic life. Therefore, they were diluted with extensive quantities of water before disposal...\"). The inclusion of a table for \"Uncontrolled variables\" also showcases a higher level of critical thought regarding the experimental design.\n\nWhile both essays feature strong experimental plans, Essay B is demonstrably better due to its comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements. The complete omission of ethical and environmental considerations in Essay A is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation, making Essay B the clear winner.",
