  "reasoning": "While both submissions present viable scientific investigations, Essay B demonstrates a superior understanding of the complete scientific process, particularly in its evaluation and safety considerations. \n\nEssay A presents a clear research question, 'To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?', and a well-structured methodology. However, it completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw in a practical science report. Its evaluation is present but relatively superficial.\n\nEssay B, despite missing the introduction and background in the provided text, presents a very strong methodology and a detailed 'Safety, Ethics and Environment' section. It correctly identifies the need for personal protective equipment, proper ventilation, and appropriate disposal of materials. Furthermore, its 'Strengths and Limitations' section is exemplary, systematically breaking down errors, classifying them as random or systematic, and suggesting specific, relevant improvements. This level of critical reflection and procedural diligence makes it the stronger submission overall.",
