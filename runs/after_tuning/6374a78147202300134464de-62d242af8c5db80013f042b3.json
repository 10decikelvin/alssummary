  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the depth, specificity, and complexity of the investigation. Essay B's research question is exemplary: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\" This is focused, detailed, and outlines both the precise independent variable range and the analytical methodology. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks the same level of specificity.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B presents a more sophisticated and well-researched plan, employing a complexometric back-titration. It even includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section justifying this choice over alternatives like FAAS, showcasing a high level of engagement. Essay A's calorimetry experiment is appropriate but standard. Furthermore, Essay B's identification and justification of controlled variables is far more extensive and thorough, listing nine distinct variables with detailed explanations. Essay A identifies only four, with simpler justifications. Finally, Essay B's safety considerations are specific and robust, noting that \"Ammonia buffer is used in the fume cupboard\" because \"Ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive.\" Essay A's safety section is generic, stating only \"I also wore gloves and laboratory glasses.\" Essay B also includes a more thoughtful environmental consideration regarding food and packaging waste, whereas Essay A's is limited to chemical disposal.",
