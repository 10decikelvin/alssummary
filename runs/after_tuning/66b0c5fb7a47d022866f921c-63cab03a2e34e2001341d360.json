  "reasoning": "The final decision is that Essay A is superior. This is primarily due to its clear, focused, and scientifically sound research question and experimental design, which are the cornerstones of Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", establishes a clear, quantifiable, and controllable independent variable (volumetric concentration) and a directly measurable dependent variable (enthalpy of combustion). The background information is highly relevant, linking thermochemical principles (enthalpy vs. carbon chain length) directly to the real-world context of fuel efficiency and emissions. The methodology is appropriate (calorimetry), and the section on controlled variables is exemplary, detailing not only what will be controlled but also why and how, as seen in the entry for room temperature: \"The air conditioner will be set to 25\u00b0C...all windows and doors will be shut to ensure no heat enters/escapes the room.\" Furthermore, all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are explicitly and appropriately addressed.\n\nConversely, Essay B is built on a weak foundation. Its research question is contradictory and confusing: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\" It claims to compare \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary data collection method (Winkler's method). The independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is qualitative and poorly defined, based on subjective observations rather than a measurable parameter. While the methodology for measuring dissolved oxygen is chemically complex and the safety section is very detailed regarding specific chemical hazards like \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer,\" these strengths cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in the experimental design. Additionally, Essay B fails to address ethical considerations at all, which is an omission.\n\nIn summary, Essay A presents a well-conceived, coherent, and methodologically sound investigation from start to finish. Essay B, despite demonstrating knowledge of a complex titration technique, suffers from a critically flawed research question and a weak experimental design, making Essay A the better example of Criterion B.",
