  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B components, but Essay A is superior due to its more comprehensive and thoughtful approach to the overall experimental design.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is clear, focused, and specific, providing the exact concentrations to be tested. Its methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining not only the creation of the bioplastic but also the sophisticated use of a \"Vernier LabQuest 2\" and \"Tracker Software\" for precise data collection. The variables section is exemplary, featuring robust tables for controlled variables (explaining both *how* and *why* they are controlled) and, impressively, a table for uncontrolled variables like \"Uniform Depth of Sample,\" showing a high level of critical thought about the procedure's limitations. Crucially, Essay A includes a detailed \"Risk Assessment\" table that thoroughly addresses safety (\"Handling of glass\"), environmental (\"Disposal of bioplastics\"), and ethical considerations (\"Use of edible materials\"), demonstrating a complete fulfillment of this criterion.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is also excellent, clearly defining the scope and method of inquiry. The methodology is scientifically sound, correctly incorporating a calibration experiment, which is essential for the chosen technique. The controlled variables are also well-justified in a table. However, Essay B's main weakness lies in its handling of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. The safety section is brief, stating only that \"Lab coat and gloves were worn,\" without the structured risk assessment seen in Essay A. More significantly, it entirely omits any discussion of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a notable deficiency for an experimental investigation involving chemical disposal.\n\nIn conclusion, while both essays demonstrate strong scientific planning, Essay A's meticulous attention to all aspects of Criterion B, especially its comprehensive treatment of variables (both controlled and uncontrolled) and its robust, explicit consideration of safety, environmental, and ethical factors, makes it the stronger submission.",
