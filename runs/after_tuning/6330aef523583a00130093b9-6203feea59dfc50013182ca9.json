  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably better as it exhibits a much stronger understanding of the core principles of experimental design required for Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the quality of the research question and the identification of variables. Essay B presents a focused and detailed research question: \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\". This question clearly defines the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (BOD), duration, and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\", is a less sophisticated closed-ended (yes/no) question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B correctly and explicitly identifies its variables. For the independent variable, it states, \"The independent variable in this study is the pH of water sample,\" and for the dependent, \"The concentration of dissolved oxygen as found on day 1 and day 5, thereby BOD... is the dependent variable for this study.\" Essay A, however, fundamentally misidentifies its variables, stating the \"Dependent\" is \"Different types of substances\" and the \"Independent\" is \"Temperature change,\" when in fact the type of reaction is the independent variable and the temperature change is the dependent variable. This is a critical flaw in experimental design.\n\nBoth essays are experimental investigations and address safety, but Essay B's approach is more thorough, presenting a table that links specific chemicals like \"80% concentrated solution of H\u2082SO\u2084\" to their specific risks, such as \"Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\". Essay A's safety section is adequate but more generic. While both essays have relevant background information and appropriate methodologies, Essay B's superior research question and correct identification of variables make it the clear winner.",
