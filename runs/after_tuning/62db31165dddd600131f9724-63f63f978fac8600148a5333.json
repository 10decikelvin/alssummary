  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality across all aspects of Criterion B. The superiority begins with the research question itself. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is highly specific, detailing the independent variable range, the dependent variable, and the exact method of quantification. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this crucial level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B provides an excellent, in-depth background that clearly justifies the chosen methodology and variable ranges, explaining concepts from biosorption mechanisms to the limitations of UV-vis spectrophotometry. For instance, it rationalizes the acidic pH range by noting, \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4... Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" Essay A's background is relevant but lacks this depth of justification. Most critically, Essay B includes a complete, step-by-step methodology and a comprehensive table correctly identifying and explaining the independent, dependent, and multiple controlled variables. Essay A is profoundly deficient here, as it provides no procedural steps and its variables table is completely empty, containing only headings.\n\nFinally, as both are experimental investigations, the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations is paramount. Essay B addresses these aspects thoroughly and specifically, stating, \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area to prevent contamination of drainage water.\" Essay A completely omits any discussion of S/E/E considerations, which is a major flaw. Overall, Essay B presents a well-planned, justified, and complete exploration, while Essay A is missing fundamental components required for Criterion B.",
