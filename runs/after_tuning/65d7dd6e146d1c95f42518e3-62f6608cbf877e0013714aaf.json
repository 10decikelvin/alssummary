  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations. Essay A provides a very specific research question: \"How do varying temperatures (15.0\u00b0C, 20.0\u00b0C, 25.0\u00b0C, 30.0\u00b0C, 35.0\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) affect the buffer capacity ofpH-balancing facial cleansers when titrated with 0.05mol HCl, measured using a pH probe with its ability to resist changes in pH value of 1\". This is far superior to Essay B's \"How does temperature affect the rate of reaction between sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid?\". Essay A's RQ is highly focused and measurable. Both essays have relevant background sections. The methodology in Essay A is detailed and appropriate for answering the specific research question, including sample preparation and the titration process. In contrast, Essay B's method is less detailed, particularly in how the \"disappearance\" of the cross will be objectively measured. For variables, both correctly identify the independent and dependent variables. However, Essay A also includes a table of controlled variables and how they will be controlled (\"temperature of water bath\", \"volume of Na\u2082S\u2082O\u2083\"), which is a stronger demonstration of experimental design. Essay A also provides a more thorough safety assessment, identifying specific hazards like the corrosiveness of HCl and providing concrete handling procedures (\"wear eye protection, lab coat and gloves\"). Essay B's safety section is more generic (\"wear goggles, lab coat and gloves\"). Finally, Essay A includes a dedicated section on data analysis, mentioning specific calculations like mean and standard deviation, which is absent in Essay B. Overall, Essay A presents a more rigorous, well-defined, and thorough experimental plan.",
