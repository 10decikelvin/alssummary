  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused and detailed research question, rigorous scientific background, and thoughtfully justified methodology. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\", is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining the exact conditions and measurements. In contrast, Essay B's question is clear but lacks this level of detail. The background section of Essay A is comprehensive, linking the BZ reaction to real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia and grounding the investigation in core chemical principles like collision theory and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Essay B's background is more of a personal narrative and lacks the same theoretical depth.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A shines by detailing the process of selecting the optimal measurement tool, explaining why a lux sensor was chosen over visual observation or a colorimeter. The control of variables is also outstanding, with a detailed table explaining not just what is controlled, but why and how. Essay B's methodology contains a significant procedural flaw by using a less precise measuring cylinder instead of a pipette for a titration aliquot (\"25 cm\u00b3 of the solution...was added to another conical flask...using a measuring cylinder\"). Furthermore, Essay B's thermal decomposition method presents a contradiction, stating time is a control variable (\"a time of 3 minutes was set for heating\") while also stating the procedure is to heat until \"a constant mass was obtained.\"\n\nFinally, while both essays have strong safety and environmental considerations, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of engagement by not only detailing disposal (\"solutions were diluted, neutralised and disposed of by a certified lab technician\") but also by proactively minimizing waste (\"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint\"). Essay A's combination of a sophisticated research question, deep background knowledge, and a meticulously planned and justified method makes it the stronger submission.",
