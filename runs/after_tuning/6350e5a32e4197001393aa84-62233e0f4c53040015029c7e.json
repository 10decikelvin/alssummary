  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A is stronger as it presents a more complete and well-structured exploration. While both essays provide relevant background information, Essay A's research question is exceptionally clear and focused: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". This is superior to Essay B's slightly ambiguous question. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is presented in a logical, step-by-step manner that is easy to follow. In contrast, Essay B's methodology is highly disorganized, with sections numbered in a non-sequential order (e.g., section \u2464 precedes section \u2462), making the experimental plan difficult to comprehend. The most significant difference, however, lies in the consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental impacts. Essay A provides a thorough and specific section covering all three aspects, noting for instance that \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation so it minimises the risk to the environment\" and explicitly stating that \"No animal or human being was harmed\". Essay B, while an experimental investigation, provides only a brief, incomplete safety section and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw. Therefore, Essay A's clear structure and comprehensive fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements make it the better essay.",
