  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its significantly more detailed and scientifically rigorous approach to the core elements of Criterion B, despite a notable weakness in its safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations.\n\nFirst, Essay B presents a superior research question: \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\". This question is clear, focused, and highly specific, identifying the independent and dependent variables while also explicitly stating the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this level of detail and specificity.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology and control of variables are exemplary. It outlines a comprehensive, repeatable experimental procedure that includes a calibration experiment, demonstrating a high level of planning. Its table of controlled variables is particularly strong, detailing not only what is controlled but also *why* it is important and *how* it will be controlled (e.g., \"The temperature function of the magnetic stirrer was used to maintain all solutions at 40\u00b0C\"). Essay A's methodology is appropriate for a data-based study, correctly identifying sources like \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook,\" but it inherently lacks the complexity and demonstration of experimental design seen in Essay B.\n\nFinally, while Essay B has a clear weakness in its S/E/E section\u2014it mentions safety but completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental considerations (like waste disposal), which is a significant flaw for an experimental investigation\u2014its foundational strengths in the research question, background, and methodological design are overwhelming. Essay A is a competent data-based study, but Essay B demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement, planning, and understanding of experimental control, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B overall.",
