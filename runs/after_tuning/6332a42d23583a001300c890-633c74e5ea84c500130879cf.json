  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the requirements for Criterion B. The core of its strength lies in its highly focused and specific research question: \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy.\" This question precisely identifies the reactants, the independent variable (temperature), and the dependent variable (rate constant, leading to activation energy). In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad and lacks specificity regarding the chosen salts or temperature ranges.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed and replicable, providing specific concentrations (\"Oxalic acid - H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 (0.5 M)\", \"Potassium permanganate - KMnO\u2084 (0.02 M)\"), volumes, and a clear set of temperatures to be tested (\"71\u00b0C, 61\u00b0C, 48.5\u00b0C, 36.5\u00b0C or 23\u00b0C\"). Essay B's methodology is vague and incomplete; for example, it fails to state the volume of distilled water used, a critical controlled variable, making the experiment impossible to replicate accurately. This weakness in Essay B is compounded by its confused identification of variables, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and omitting the volume of the solvent from its controlled variables list.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It identifies specific chemical hazards and, crucially, addresses disposal: \"The solution [potassium hydroxide] was carefully disposed of as a hazardous waste after the end of the experiment\". It also explicitly addresses ethics, stating, \"There were no ethical issues, as no live organisms were used\". Essay B, however, provides only a generic safety warning (\"The salt used in this experiment can cause irritation\") and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a significant failing for an experimental investigation. Overall, Essay A presents a well-conceived, clearly articulated, and thorough exploration, whereas Essay B is superficial and fundamentally flawed in its experimental design and communication.",
