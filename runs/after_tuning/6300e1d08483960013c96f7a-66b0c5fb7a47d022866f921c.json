  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger as it demonstrates a higher level of scientific thinking and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary differentiator is the meticulous attention to detail in the experimental design and the inclusion of a comprehensive risk assessment. Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is specific and deeply rooted in a well-explained real-world context of fuel efficiency and environmental impact. Its methodology is appropriate and sophisticated, with excellent justification for the control of variables, such as the rationale for using kJ/g over kJ/mol: \"The uncertainties in the contents of the substances makes kJmol\u207b\u00b9 an unreliable measurement unit to use.\" Furthermore, Essay B includes a dedicated and specific \"Risk Assessment\" section that addresses all safety (\"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\"), environmental (\"disposed of through a waste collection company\"), and ethical (\"No ethical considerations were considered\") aspects, which is crucial for an experimental investigation involving flammable substances.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A, while having a clear research question (\"To what extent do different types of salts... affect the volume of melted ice?\"), suffers from a significant conceptual flaw and a critical omission. The methodology controls the independent variable by mass (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\"), which contradicts its own background information that emphasizes the importance of the number of ions (molality and the Van't Hoff factor). A mole-based comparison would have been far more chemically relevant. Most critically, Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. This failure to conduct a risk assessment is a major deficiency for a hands-on experimental investigation, making Essay B the clear superior.",
