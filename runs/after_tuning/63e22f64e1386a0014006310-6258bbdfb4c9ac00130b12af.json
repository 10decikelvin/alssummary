  "reasoning": "While both essays present competent experimental plans, Essay B is demonstrably superior across nearly all aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in its depth, methodological complexity, and thoroughness, particularly regarding safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\" is more specific and detailed than Essay A's, as it names the exact temperatures and the specific analytical techniques to be used. Essay B's methodology is substantially more rigorous, detailing the preparation and standardization of reagents like \"ethanolic potassium hydroxide 0.5M\" and employing advanced techniques such as reflux and multiple titrations. This contrasts with Essay A's more standard and straightforward calorimetry procedure. Furthermore, Essay B includes a \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains the choice of temperatures and concentrations, demonstrating a deeper level of thought.\n\nWhile both essays correctly identify their variables, Essay B's list of controlled variables is more comprehensive, including subtle factors like \"Microbial Contamination\" and \"Light\" and explaining why they must be controlled. The most significant differentiator, however, is the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Essay A provides a good safety table but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical flaw for an experimental investigation. In contrast, Essay B addresses all three components explicitly. It discusses safety risks from \"Flammable liquids\" and \"Hazardous liquids,\" addresses ethical issues by stating its commitment not to waste resources, and considers environmental impact by noting that \"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\" This comprehensive approach makes Essay B a much more complete and well-considered investigation.",
