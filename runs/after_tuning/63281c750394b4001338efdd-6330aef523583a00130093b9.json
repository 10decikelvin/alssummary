  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay A due to its fundamentally sound and competent experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Essay B, while ambitious, contains a critical flaw in its identification of variables.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear, focused, and sets up a viable investigation. Its background information is relevant, its methodology is appropriate for the research question, and importantly, it correctly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Essay A states, \"Independent variable in this research is the concentration of the potassium nitrate solution and the dependent variable will be the temperature difference after heating the solution,\" which is accurate. It also explicitly addresses safety, ethical (\"I did not use any materials from living organisms therefore there were no ethical precautions needed.\"), and environmental considerations, fulfilling all requirements of the criterion.\n\nEssay B's research question is far more ambitious: \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions... from enthalpy changes of precipitation reaction...\". Its theoretical background is excellent, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of thermochemistry with detailed Hess's law cycles. However, the essay falters on a fundamental aspect of experimental design. It incorrectly identifies its variables, stating the dependent variable is \"Different types of substances dissolved\" and the independent variable is \"Temperature change\". This reversal demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of experimental control. Furthermore, while its safety precautions are specific, it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations.\n\nUltimately, a well-executed, simpler investigation with a correct design (Essay A) is superior to a highly ambitious investigation with a fundamental design flaw (Essay B). The misidentification of variables in Essay B is a critical error that undermines the entire exploration, making Essay A the better example of Criterion B.",
