  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental explorations. However, Essay B is demonstrably better as it more thoroughly fulfills all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined and detailed: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". It specifies the exact range for the independent variable and includes a key controlled variable (time) directly within the question. While Essay A's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is clear and good, it is slightly less specific than Essay B's.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring these sections. Essay B excels here, providing dedicated, specific sections for each. For safety, it notes \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive... wear gloves, a lab coat, and a pair of safety glasses.\" It explicitly addresses ethics: \"There are no ethical issues to be considered...\". Crucially, it provides detailed environmental considerations, including specific disposal methods: \"Copper sulphate is a pesticide... the acid must be neutralized first then disposed of.\" In stark contrast, Essay A provides a brief safety section but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for an experimental report.\n\nWhile Essay A's methodology, involving a calibration curve and spectrophotometry, is sophisticated, and its background explanation of the \"diverse ion effect\" is sound, Essay B's overall execution of the exploration is more complete. Essay B's background research, which cites previous studies, and its meticulous, step-by-step procedure make it a robust and well-rounded investigation. The complete and thorough fulfillment of all required Criterion B elements, especially the safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, makes Essay B the superior piece of work.",
