  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its significantly more detailed and precise methodology. For instance, it specifies the exact temperatures to be tested (15.0\u00b0C, 20.0\u00b0C, etc.) and the precise concentration of the titrant (0.05mol HCl), whereas Essay A is less specific, just mentioning 'different temperatures' in the research question. Essay B's description of the procedure is also more meticulous, including steps like calibrating the pH probe, which demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor. Furthermore, the 'Controlled Variables' section in Essay B is more comprehensive, not only listing the variables but also explaining why they need to be controlled, which showcases a deeper understanding of experimental design principles. While both essays address safety, Essay B's formatted risk assessment is more structured and thorough.",
