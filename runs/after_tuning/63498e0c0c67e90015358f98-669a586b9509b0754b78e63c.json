  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations. Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more thorough and detailed approach across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question is exceptionally specific, stating: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids...in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, ... 1.000mol dm^-3)...measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This level of detail, including reactant mass, specific concentrations, and a time frame, is significantly better than Essay A's question, which is clear but lacks this specificity. Furthermore, Essay B includes a \"Pre-test\" section, demonstrating a thoughtful, iterative experimental design process that justifies the chosen variable ranges and duration, a feature absent in Essay A. The most significant difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides a detailed safety table for each chemical and explicitly addresses both ethical and environmental impacts, noting for the latter, \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water...\". In contrast, Essay A offers a brief safety section and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical flaw for an experimental investigation. While Essay A presents a competent investigation with a good methodology and well-controlled variables, Essay B's comprehensive and meticulous approach to every component of the exploration makes it the stronger submission.",
