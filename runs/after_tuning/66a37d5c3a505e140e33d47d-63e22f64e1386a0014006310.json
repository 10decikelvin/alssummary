  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundations for a scientific investigation, but Essay A is superior due to its complete fulfillment of all Criterion B requirements. Both essays feature clear, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature... of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration measured by redox titration?\", specifying variables, ranges, and method. Essay B also has a strong, two-part question: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\". Both also provide relevant, detailed background information and an appropriate methodology.\n\nHowever, the primary distinction lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring these aspects to be addressed. Essay A successfully addresses all three components. For safety, it notes that \"tongs [will be used] to prevent skin burns\" and \"lab coat, gloves, and goggles were worn\". For ethical considerations, it thoughtfully states, \"the least possible amount of fruits was used and they were thoroughly squeezed to minimize the waste of such products\". Environmentally, it mentions that the heating plate was \"powered off and unplugged when it was not used\" to prevent \"excessive energy consumption\".\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B has a solid safety section, noting risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" and precautions such as having a \"fire blanket and a fire extinguisher nearby\", it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. The disposal of multiple organic alcohols is a clear environmental issue that should have been addressed. This omission is a significant flaw in an otherwise strong exploration. Because Essay A demonstrates a more complete and holistic approach by addressing all required aspects of the exploration, it is the better essay.",
