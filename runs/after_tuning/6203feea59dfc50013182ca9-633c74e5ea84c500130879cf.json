  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its well-defined and focused research question: \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\". This question is specific, detailing the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (BOD), timescale, and measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad and lacks focus by including two independent variables without specifying the salts or temperature ranges.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background section is comprehensive and directly relevant, explaining the chemical principles of both Biological Oxygen Demand and the Winkler method with appropriate redox equations. Essay B's background is superficial, offering only a simple definition of solubility without exploring the underlying chemical principles like lattice and hydration enthalpies. The methodology and variables section of Essay A is also a clear strength; it provides a logical, step-by-step procedure and correctly identifies independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a detailed table. Essay B's variables section is fundamentally flawed, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as independent variables, which reveals a misunderstanding of its own experimental design.\n\nFinally, while both essays omit an explicit ethical consideration, Essay A provides a far more robust treatment of safety and environmental factors. Essay A includes a detailed table listing specific \"Potential Dangers/Risks\" for each chemical used, such as \"Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\" for H\u2082SO\u2084. It also explicitly mentions waste disposal: \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory\". Essay B's safety section is generic, and it critically omits any mention of environmental considerations or disposal, a significant failing for an experimental investigation. The foundational weaknesses in Essay B's research question, background, and variable identification make Essay A the clear winner.",
