  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it presents a complete and well-structured exploration, whereas Essay B is critically incomplete. Essay A's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is more specific and detailed than Essay B's more general question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\". Furthermore, Essay A provides a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology and a detailed variables table that clearly outlines the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, making the investigation clear and repeatable. In stark contrast, Essay B's submission is truncated, completely lacking a methodology section and presenting only an empty header for its variables table. For an experimental investigation, these omissions are fatal flaws. Essay A also includes a thorough safety section with a chemical risk assessment table and explicitly addresses environmental considerations, stating \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory,\" although it omits an ethics statement. Essay B, being incomplete, fails to address any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations whatsoever. While both essays contain relevant and focused background information, Essay A's complete fulfillment of the methodological and safety requirements makes it a far more successful demonstration of Criterion B.",
