  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is better. Its superiority stems from a significantly more rigorous and sophisticated scientific exploration, which is evident in its research question, theoretical background, and methodology.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused and leads to a complex investigation. Its background is a major strength; it doesn't just provide context but derives the necessary mathematical models from chemical principles, such as the integrated second-order rate law (\"1/c - 1/c\u2080 = kt\") and the linear form of the Arrhenius equation. Citing a source like \"Das et al. [3]\" to justify the assumption of a second-order reaction demonstrates genuine research and a mature scientific approach. The methodology, involving quenching a reaction and performing back-titrations, is complex but perfectly tailored to the background theory and research question.\n\nEssay B presents a competent but more standard investigation. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear and appropriate. The methodology, simple calorimetry with a spirit burner, is also appropriate. A particular strength is its detailed consideration of environmental disposal, noting that mixtures \"are to be disposed of through a waste collection company,\" which is better practice than Essay A's suggestion to flush waste \"down the sink\". However, Essay B's exploration is less developed. The background is more narrative and lacks the theoretical depth of Essay A. Furthermore, its identification of the dependent variable is slightly confused, stating it is \"The total mass of the fuel burnt (grams)\" when this is actually the measured variable used to calculate the enthalpy of combustion.\n\nUltimately, Essay A demonstrates a much higher level of exploration. The seamless integration of advanced chemical theory (kinetics) into a well-designed, sophisticated experiment makes it a stronger example of Criterion B. Essay B is a solid experiment, but it lacks the scientific depth and rigor that distinguishes Essay A.",
