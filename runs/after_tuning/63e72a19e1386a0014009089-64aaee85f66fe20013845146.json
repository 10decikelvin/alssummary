  "reasoning": "While both essays present viable investigations, Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific rigor and attention to detail, making it the superior submission. Essay A's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...?\", is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining the independent variable's range and uncertainty. Its background section provides a robust chemical explanation of the \"salting out effect,\" linking concepts like intermolecular forces and hydration directly to the hypothesis. In contrast, while Essay B's research question is clear, it lacks this level of quantitative detail. Furthermore, Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are far more comprehensive, presented in a detailed table with specific hazards and first aid measures for each chemical used, such as \"Manganese (II) sulphate\" and \"Alkaline potassium Iodide solution,\" and also mentions disposal protocols. Essay B's safety section is generic, offering only general advice like \"Wear gloves,\" and critically, it completely omits any environmental considerations, which is a major oversight given the use of dichloromethane. Although Essay B presents a well-structured methodology and clear variables, Essay A's overall depth, precision, and thoroughness in addressing all aspects of the experimental design, especially safety and background theory, are substantially better.",
