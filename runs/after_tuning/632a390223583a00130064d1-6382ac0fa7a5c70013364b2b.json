  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is highly focused and specific, clearly defining the independent variable's range and the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...?\", is a comparative investigation but lacks the specificity of a variable range. Furthermore, Essay A's background provides a detailed theoretical basis for the investigation, explaining concepts like polymers, plasticizers, and the physics behind Young's Modulus, including the necessary equations. Essay B's background is more superficial, stating the reactions but offering less depth on the principles of back titration or thermal decomposition.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant point of differentiation. Essay A presents a meticulous, repeatable procedure that incorporates modern technology (\"Vernier LabQuest 2 and its Force Sensor Attachment\", \"Tracker Software\") to ensure accuracy. Its control of variables is exemplary, detailed in a comprehensive table that includes justifications and specific quantities (e.g., \"15.00g \u00b1 0.01g of Cornstarch\"). Essay B's methodology contains a critical flaw; in its back titration procedure, it states, \"25 cm\u00b3 of the solution in the conical flask A was added to another conical flask labelled B, using a measuring cylinder,\" which is an inappropriate and inaccurate technique for titration. Additionally, the student correctly identifies in their evaluation that using a Bunsen burner for thermal decomposition is a systematic error, as the required temperature of \"700\u00b0C-850\u00b0C\" cannot be reached, which fundamentally undermines the validity of that part of the experiment.\n\nFinally, while both essays are experimental and address safety and environmental concerns, Essay A is more comprehensive. Essay B provides good safety advice and a relevant environmental point about soil pH. However, Essay A not only covers safety (\"Handling of glass\", \"Working with hot solutions\") and environmental disposal (\"disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes\") but also includes a thoughtful ethical consideration on the \"Use of edible materials,\" which demonstrates a higher level of engagement with the investigation's context.",
