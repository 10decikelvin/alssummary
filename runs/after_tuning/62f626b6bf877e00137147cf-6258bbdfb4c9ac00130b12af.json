  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question is superior because it is highly specific and detailed, stating \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\" This clearly outlines the independent variable with a precise range and the specific dependent variables. In contrast, Essay A's question, while present, is less focused and awkwardly phrased. Furthermore, Essay B provides extensive and relevant background information, explaining the chemistry behind Acid and Saponification values with diagrams, whereas Essay A's background is a single, generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\".\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and variables. Essay B presents an exceptionally detailed, replicable methodology with a \"Justification for methodology\" section, explaining choices like temperature range. Critically, it includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables, explaining not only what is being controlled (e.g., \"Mass of sample\"), but how (\"4(\u00b1 0.01)g of oil will be used\") and why (\"As the amount of oil is changed, the amount of free fatty acid content will also be changed\"). Essay A completely fails to identify any variables\u2014independent, dependent, or controlled\u2014which is a fundamental flaw in experimental design. Its methodology is a brief, numbered list lacking sufficient detail for replication.\n\nFinally, both are experimental investigations requiring safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B addresses all three aspects explicitly and thoroughly. It details safety precautions in a table (\"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)...Keep such liquid away from fire\"), discusses ethical use of materials (\"oil...was not either wasted or used in excess\"), and outlines proper environmental disposal (\"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines\"). Essay A has an adequate risk assessment for safety but its environmental consideration is generic (\"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately\") and it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations. Due to its superior research question, background, methodology, handling of variables, and comprehensive safety/ethical/environmental sections, Essay B demonstrates a far more complete and well-thought-out exploration.",
