  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A based on the requirements of Criterion B. Essay B presents a highly specific and focused research question: \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\". This question clearly outlines the independent variable (antacid brands/ingredients), the dependent variable (volume of HCl), and the precise methodology (acid-base titration). In contrast, while Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts... affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear, it lacks the same level of embedded detail.\n\nThe primary difference lies in the methodology and safety considerations. Essay B's methodology is a standard, replicable, and precise scientific procedure (titration), with clear steps and specified equipment. Essay A's methodology contains significant flaws; for instance, the instruction to \"pour the melted water into a graduated cylinder\" is ambiguous and does not account for the dissolved salt or the difficulty of separating the liquid from the remaining ice. Furthermore, Essay A's method appears to run trials sequentially, which fails to properly control for ambient temperature, a variable it correctly identifies as important.\n\nMost critically, Essay B thoroughly addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is mandatory for an experimental investigation. It explicitly mentions safety precautions (\"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl\"), ethical considerations (\"There are no ethical considerations for this experiment\"), and environmental protocols (\"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker...hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes\"). Essay A completely omits any mention of these three essential components, which is a significant failure in experimental design. While Essay A's background on freezing point depression is well-explained, its methodological weaknesses and total lack of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations make it a much weaker submission for Criterion B.",
