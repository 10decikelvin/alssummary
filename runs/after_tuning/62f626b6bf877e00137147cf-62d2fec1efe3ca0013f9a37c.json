  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger across all elements of Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Essay B's research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused, clear, and appropriately complex. It clearly identifies the independent variable (type of acid) and the dependent variable (activation energy). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is awkwardly phrased and less precise. The term \"significant\" is subjective and not well-defined within the question itself.\n\n**Background & Methodology:** Essay B provides extensive and relevant background information, explaining reaction rates, catalysts, activation energy, and the Arrhenius equation, directly linking the theory to the experimental plan. Essay A's background is extremely brief, stating only a general definition of titration. The methodology in Essay B is detailed, logical, and replicable, including specific concentrations and volumes (e.g., \"2 cm\u00b3 of 2.0M propanone\"), and even instructions for preparing solutions. Essay A's methodology is a simple list of steps lacking crucial details, such as the concentration of the indicator, and the equipment list is misplaced within the risk assessment.\n\n**Variables:** Essay B excels by presenting a clear, tabulated list of its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, explaining how each will be managed. For example, it controls the \"Concentration of propanone, iodine solution for each acid\" and specifies the range for the independent variable of temperature. Essay A completely fails to identify and discuss its controlled variables, which is a major omission.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays are experimental and address safety. However, Essay B is more thorough and specific. It correctly identifies the hazards of specific chemicals used (\"propanone is highly flammable, irritating to the eyes,\" \"iodopropanone is a lachrymator\") and provides specific disposal instructions (\"iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste\"). Essay A's safety points are more generic (\"wear protective gloves,\" \"Apparatus is fragile\"), and its disposal instruction is vague (\"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately\"). Neither essay mentions ethical considerations, which is a minor weakness for both, but Essay B's overall handling of this section is superior.\n\nIn summary, Essay B demonstrates a much deeper understanding of the scientific process, presenting a well-researched, clearly planned, and methodologically sound investigation that is far superior to the underdeveloped and poorly structured work in Essay A.",
