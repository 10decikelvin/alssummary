  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured investigations. Essay A's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl... affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...\" is highly specific, defining the exact concentrations and units to be used. Its background provides a thorough chemical explanation for the 'salting out' effect and the Winkler titration method, complete with relevant equations. Essay B's research question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid...\" is also clear and focused. Its background successfully links vitamin C, dental health, and the titration chemistry involved. Both essays provide detailed, appropriate methodologies and clearly define their variables in comprehensive tables. However, Essay A is superior in its treatment of safety and environmental considerations, presenting a detailed table of chemical hazards, first aid measures, and waste disposal protocols. In contrast, Essay B's safety section is minimal, stating \"Gloves are not necessary...\" and it completely omits any mention of environmental impact or disposal, which is a significant weakness for an experimental investigation.",
