  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A based on the provided Criterion B content.\n\nEssay B's research question is exemplary: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". It is highly specific, outlining the independent variable with its exact levels, the dependent variable with its units, the specific substance being tested, and the precise analytical method to be used. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this crucial level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough exploration. It includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section justifying its choice of complexometric titration over alternatives, which shows deeper research. The methodology is detailed and replicable. Its variables table, particularly the controlled variables, is comprehensive, not only listing the variables but also explaining the method of control and the reason for controlling them (e.g., \"The rate of losing calcium ions will increase if the volume of the milk increases hence this may affect the accuracy...\").\n\nCritically, Essay B provides a detailed and specific section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a requirement for an experimental investigation. It identifies specific chemical hazards, such as ammonia gas (\"Ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive hence exposure to high concentrations of ammonia gas will cause inflammation...\"), and procedural risks. It also correctly addresses ethical considerations (\"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved...\") and environmental impact (\"reduce the tendency of food wastage...\"). Essay A's provided text completely omits this crucial section. While Essay A provides good background information on ascorbic acid and redox reactions, it fails to match the overall depth, detail, and completeness of Essay B's exploration.",
