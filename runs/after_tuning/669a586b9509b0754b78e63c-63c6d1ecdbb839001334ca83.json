  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach to designing the investigation.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is exceptionally well-defined. It clearly specifies the independent variable (pH of HCl with specific levels), the dependent variable (mass of iron(II)), and the precise method of measurement (titration). Essay A's question is also strong, but Essay B's inclusion of the specific measurement technique within the RQ itself adds a layer of focus.\n\nThe background information in both essays is relevant, but Essay B shows a deeper level of chemical understanding. For example, it provides the balanced chemical equation and half-equations for the redox titration and includes a stoichiometric calculation to justify the choice of KMnO\u2084 concentration: \"Moles of KMnO\u2084 required... = 4.08 x 10\u207b\u2074... Moles of 0.0100 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of KMnO\u2084... = 5.00 x 10\u207b\u2074... The moles of... KMnO\u2084 used is in excess... Thus, this concentration was selected.\" This demonstrates significant preliminary thought and planning. Essay A's background is good, explaining collision theory, but it's more general in nature.\n\nIn terms of methodology and variables, both are well-structured. Essay A's use of a table for controlled variables is excellent for clarity. However, Essay B's methodology is more sophisticated (redox titration vs. gas collection) and its justification for the chosen range of the independent variable is more compelling, directly linking it to real-world examples: \"I chose this range as I'm investigating the effect of different acidities of drinks... such as Coca-Cola with pH 2.3 or milk with pH of around 6.5-6.7\". Both essays thoughtfully address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific details, such as Essay A's instructions for diluting HCl before disposal and Essay B's correct identification of KMnO\u2084 as an environmental hazard that should not be poured down the sink.\n\nOverall, while both are high-quality, Essay B's deeper integration of chemical principles into its experimental design, particularly the justification of reactant concentration and the selection of a more precise analytical technique, makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
