  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations involving titrations. Essay B is demonstrably superior across nearly all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is far more detailed and focused than Essay A's, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\". Essay B's question specifies the independent variable, dependent variable, sample volume, sample sources, and a key controlled variable, which is a hallmark of a well-planned investigation. While both essays provide relevant and detailed background information, Essay B's methodology and variable identification are complete and thorough, whereas Essay A's are missing or incomplete. Essay B clearly outlines its methodology in distinct stages and presents a well-justified table of variables. Most critically, Essay B includes a comprehensive section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a requirement for an experimental investigation. For example, it notes specific chemical hazards and disposal methods: \"Sulfuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin\" and \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\". Essay A completely omits this crucial section. Therefore, Essay B presents a much more complete, detailed, and well-considered scientific exploration.",
