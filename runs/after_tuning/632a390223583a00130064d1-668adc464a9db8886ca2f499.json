  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and chemical understanding, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally clear and detailed. It specifies the exact molar concentrations to be used and the precise method of measurement (spectrophotometry). This specificity is superior to Essay A's, which uses percentages. Furthermore, Essay B's background information is more chemically sophisticated, discussing reaction kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the underlying redox reactions of bleach, even providing the stoichiometry for a titration. It also cites a previous academic study, \"Henary, M.M., Russell, A.A.J. Chem. Educ., 2007,\" which grounds the investigation in existing scientific literature.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is particularly impressive due to the inclusion of a preliminary experiment. Recognizing that the \"concentration of the bleach used was unknown,\" the student designed and executed a titration \"to find the initial concentration of the commercial bleach.\" This demonstrates excellent experimental planning and problem-solving. In contrast, Essay A's methodology, while detailed and appropriate, is more straightforward.\n\nEssay A is very competent. Its research question is focused, the variables are thoroughly identified (including a good section on uncontrolled variables), and its safety, ethical, and environmental section is exemplary. For instance, it thoughtfully considers the \"Ethical: Use of edible materials\" and provides specific disposal instructions for its bioplastic: \"they should be disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes.\" Essay B's safety table is also very detailed, but it omits an explicit mention of ethical considerations.\n\nDespite Essay A's strong structure and comprehensive S/E/E section, Essay B's superior chemical depth, its linkage to existing research, and its more complex and rigorous experimental design (including the preliminary titration) make it the better overall investigation in the context of Criterion B.",
