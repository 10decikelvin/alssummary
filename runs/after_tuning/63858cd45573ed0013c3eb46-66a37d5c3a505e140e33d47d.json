  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay A due to its superior experimental design and more thorough consideration of variables and environmental impact, despite Essay B having a more precisely worded research question.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C... concentration measured by redox titration?\", is exceptionally well-formulated, including specific variable ranges and evaluative language. However, this strength is undermined by a significant flaw in its experimental design. The essay incorrectly identifies \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable, while the justification states its purpose is for \"Comparing different types of juices\". This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding, as it is being treated as a second independent variable, not a controlled one.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A demonstrates a much stronger command of experimental design. Its variables table is meticulous, correctly identifying the independent, dependent, and multiple controlled variables with clear justifications. For instance, the control for \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" is detailed: \"granules were ground up using a mortar and pestle... using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This level of detail shows a sophisticated understanding of factors that could influence the results.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations are more robust. While both essays address all three aspects, Essay A's environmental section is more specific regarding chemical disposal, stating that waste was \"collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal\". Essay B's environmental consideration is limited to unplugging the heating plate, which is a weaker point. Although Essay A's methodology of measuring foam volume is less conventional, the student shows self-awareness by discussing this choice, which is a sign of personal engagement. Ultimately, Essay A's strong experimental design and thoroughness in variables and S/E/E outweigh the superior wording of Essay B's research question.",
