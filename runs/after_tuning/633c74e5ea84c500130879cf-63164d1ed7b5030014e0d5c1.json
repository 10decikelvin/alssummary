  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. The primary difference lies in the clarity and focus of the investigation from the outset. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is specific, focused, and includes evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad, attempting to tackle two independent variables without defining the specific salts or conditions.\n\nThis initial strength in Essay B carries through to the subsequent sections. Essay B's background provides detailed, relevant chemical theory, including the balanced redox reaction for the titration: \"C~6~H~8~O~6~(l)+I~2~(l) \u2192 C~6~H~6~O~6~(l)+2 I\u207b+2 H\u207a\". Essay A's background is superficial, primarily offering a basic definition of solubility. Furthermore, Essay B correctly and clearly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, justifying each. Essay A, however, demonstrates significant confusion, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and providing a vague methodology that omits critical details, such as the volume of solvent used.\n\nFinally, Essay B properly addresses all required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations for an experimental investigation. It includes a specific \"Risk Assessment\" section and explicitly states its considerations for ethics (\"No significant ethical concerns\") and the environment (\"No significant environmental concerns\"). Essay A provides only generic safety precautions and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental factors, a critical failure for an experimental lab report. Overall, Essay B presents a well-designed, focused, and thoroughly considered exploration, while Essay A's exploration is poorly defined and incomplete.",
