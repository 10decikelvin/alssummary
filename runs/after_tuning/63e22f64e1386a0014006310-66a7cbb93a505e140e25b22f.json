  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable, experimental investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more rigorous and scientifically sound approach to the exploration and design phase, making it the superior submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's primary strength lies in its excellent research question and variable management. The RQ is exceptionally clear and detailed, specifying both the range of the independent variable (\"length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)\") and the specific isomers for comparison. This level of detail sets a strong foundation. Furthermore, its table of controlled variables is exemplary; it not only lists variables like \"Calorimeter\" and \"Volume of water samples\" but also provides robust justifications for *why* they must be controlled and details on *how* they will be controlled. This demonstrates a deep understanding of experimental design.\n\nEssay B's research question is also clear and focused, stating \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise\". Its methodology is appropriate, and it successfully addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. For instance, its environmental section correctly notes that \"hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes if poured down the drain\" and suggests proper disposal. This completeness in the S/E/E section is a notable strength over Essay A.\n\nDespite this, Essay B has a significant weakness in its identification of variables. It lists \"Mass of indigestion tablets\" as an independent variable but then states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This reflects a misunderstanding of variable control. The brand/composition is the independent variable; the mass is a confounding variable that should either be controlled (by using an equal mass of each powdered tablet) or measured and accounted for in the analysis (e.g., volume of HCl neutralized per gram). This confusion undermines the rigor of the experimental design.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A's main weakness is its failure to provide any specific details on environmental or ethical considerations, despite including them in the section heading. For an experimental investigation involving the combustion of organic chemicals, this is a notable omission. However, the fundamental quality of its experimental design\u2014evidenced by the superb RQ and meticulous variable table\u2014is a more critical component of Criterion B. Therefore, Essay A's stronger grasp of core scientific methodology makes it the better essay.",
