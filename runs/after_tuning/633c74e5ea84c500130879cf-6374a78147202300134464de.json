  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much stronger foundation in all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question is exemplary in its focus and detail: \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\". This specificity provides a clear and manageable scope for the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is double-barreled and lacks specific parameters, making it unfocused. Furthermore, Essay B's background section is thorough, correctly identifying the reaction type and even calculating the Gibbs free energy (\"$\\Delta G_{\\text {cell }}^{\\theta}=-212300 k J$\") to establish the reaction's feasibility, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying theory. Essay A's background is superficial by comparison.\n\nA critical flaw in Essay A is the incorrect identification of its variables; it lists \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as independent variables, which fundamentally misrepresents its own experimental design where concentration is independent and crystallization temperature is dependent. Essay B, however, correctly identifies its independent (\"Concentration\"), dependent (\"Change in temperature\"), and controlled variables. Finally, Essay B comprehensively addresses all required considerations, explicitly stating its approach to safety, ethics (\"I took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions.\"), and environmental impact (\"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways...\"). Essay A only addresses safety, completely omitting any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant deficiency for an experimental investigation.",
