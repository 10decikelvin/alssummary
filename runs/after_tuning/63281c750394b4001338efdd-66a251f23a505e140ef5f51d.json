  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher quality of exploration (Criterion B) than Essay A across all assessed elements. The superiority begins with the research question; Essay B's is highly specific and detailed, stating, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". In contrast, Essay A's RQ is much simpler and lacks this level of detail: \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\".\n\nThis depth continues in the background section, where Essay B provides a comprehensive theoretical context, connecting the experiment to Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and Beer-Lambert's law. Essay B also strengthens its exploration by including a section on \"Preliminary experiments,\" showing a proactive and scientific approach to refining its method. Essay A's background is relevant but comparatively superficial, primarily defining specific heat capacity and drawing a simple analogy to a sodium chloride solution.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is far more rigorous. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, explaining not only how each variable is controlled but also providing a scientific justification for why control is necessary. For example, regarding the volume of nitric acid, it notes that \"abnormally large nitric acid volumes/concentrations would cause inaccurate shifts in the amount of reactants and products, as it can react with SCN\u207b(aq) ions\". Essay A identifies key variables but provides less detailed justifications.\n\nFinally, both essays are experimental investigations requiring full safety, ethical, and environmental consideration. Essay B excels by providing chemical-specific safety warnings, such as \"potassium thiocyanate...Contact with acids liberates toxic gas,\" and specific environmental advice, noting the chemicals \"pose a risk to aquatic organisms\" and should be kept from drains. In contrast, Essay A's considerations are generic, for safety it states \"Wearing safety goggles to prevent any glass if to get in the eye if a beaker falls and breaks,\" and for environmental, \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\". While Essay A presents a viable investigation, Essay B's depth, specificity, and clear scientific context make it the unequivocally stronger submission for Criterion B.",
