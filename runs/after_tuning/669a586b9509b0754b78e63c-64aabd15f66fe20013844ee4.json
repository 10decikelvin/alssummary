  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior as it presents a well-conceived, methodologically sound investigation and comprehensively addresses all aspects of Criterion B. In contrast, Essay B is built upon a fundamentally flawed methodology and has critical omissions regarding safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nFirst, Essay A's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3)...?\". This level of specificity, including the precise independent variable values, sets a strong foundation. Essay B's question is clear but less detailed.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology. Essay A uses an appropriate method (gas collection over water) that directly measures a product of the intended reaction. Essay B's methodology is fundamentally flawed; it uses acid-base titration with NaOH to measure ascorbic acid in a solution containing other acids. The essay itself acknowledges this fatal flaw in its evaluation section: \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid\". This inappropriate choice of titrant means the experiment cannot answer the research question, a major failure in experimental design.\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) aspects. It provides a detailed safety table with hazards, precautions, and emergency actions for HCl. It also explicitly addresses environmental impact, stating that solutions \"were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water,\" and notes that there are \"no ethical considerations.\" Essay B's approach is critically weak; it dismisses safety concerns with the statement \"Gloves are not necessary\" and fails to mention eye protection. Most notably, it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant failure for an experimental investigation. While both essays correctly identify variables, Essay A's robust design and thoroughness make it the far better example of Criterion B.",
