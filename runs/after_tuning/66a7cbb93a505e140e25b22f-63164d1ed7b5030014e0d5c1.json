  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior quality of exploration and experimental design compared to Essay A. The primary differentiator lies in the identification and control of variables. Essay B presents a comprehensive and well-justified list of controlled variables, crucially including the \"Mass of Bell Pepper Used in Experiment,\" stating, \"A mass of 100g of bell pepper is cut and measured using a weight balance for each reading.\" This demonstrates a strong understanding of how to ensure a fair test. In contrast, Essay A has a significant flaw in its experimental design, stating, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" While a justification is provided based on 'realism', this introduces a major uncontrolled variable, as different brands of tablets have different masses, making a direct comparison of their neutralizing power per unit mass impossible.\n\nBoth essays have strong research questions; however, Essay B's question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\" uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\") that frames a more sophisticated investigation. Both provide relevant background information with appropriate chemical equations. Regarding safety and environmental considerations, both essays address the required components. Essay A offers a more specific environmental consideration, noting that \"hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes if poured down the drain.\" Essay B's safety precautions are more tailored to its specific procedure, mentioning risks with the hot plate (\"use only heat-resistant, borosilicate glassware\"). However, the fundamental strength of an investigation lies in its design, and Essay B's rigorous control of variables is decisively better than Essay A's, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
