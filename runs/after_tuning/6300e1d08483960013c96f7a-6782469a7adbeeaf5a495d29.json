  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A in its demonstration of Criterion B. The superiority begins with the research question itself. Essay B's question, \"What is the pseudo order of reaction... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3,\" is exceptionally focused, specifying the exact concentration range of the independent variable, the analytical technique (UV-Vis), and the specific kinetic parameters to be determined. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts... affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear but lacks this high degree of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is far more comprehensive and directly informs the methodology. It cites external research to justify its experimental design, such as avoiding the \"Scavenging Effect of Excess H2O2\" by keeping concentrations below a specific threshold: \"by choosing values of [H2O2] lesser then 2.93 mmol dm\u207b\u00b3, we will be able to circumvent anomalies\". Essay A's background on freezing point depression is relevant but is more generic and lacks the depth and integration seen in Essay B. The methodology in Essay B is also more rigorous, evidenced by the inclusion of \"Preliminary Trials\" which were used to refine the procedure, a hallmark of excellent scientific exploration. Essay A's method is straightforward but contains a potential flaw in its sequential design (\"Repeat steps 11-12 for KCl\", etc.), which could compromise the control of ambient temperature over the extended duration of the experiment.\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B successfully addresses all required components of an experimental investigation. It includes a dedicated section on \"Safety Precautions & Sustainability,\" with specific details like wearing \"gloves and lab coats... to prevent chemical burns and exposure to carcinogens\" and ensuring chemicals were \"disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC.\" Essay A, despite also being an experimental lab, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency in Criterion B. This omission, combined with the superior focus, depth, and rigor of Essay B, makes the decision clear.",
