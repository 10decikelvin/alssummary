  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay A due to its significantly more detailed and focused scientific exploration, despite a notable flaw. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is superior because it is highly specific, identifying not only the independent and dependent variables but also the precise method of calculation. In contrast, Essay B presents two simpler questions (\"Does the number of carbon atoms... affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\" and \"...affect its boiling point?\") which lack this level of detail. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is that of a complex, hands-on experiment, and it is supported by an exemplary table of controlled variables that explains both *why* and *how* each variable (e.g., Temperature, Stirring, Particle size) was controlled. Essay B, being a data-based investigation, has a simpler methodology and its control is limited to selecting \"only linear primary alcohols,\" which is appropriate but less demonstrative of experimental design skills.\n\nEssay A's primary weakness is its handling of safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations. While it provides specific safety precautions (\"...cause skin and nasal irritations, the experiment was carried out in a well-ventilated room. Lab coat and gloves were worn...\"), it completely omits any mention of environmental impact or ethical considerations, a significant oversight for an experimental investigation. Essay B, being data-based, is not penalized for omitting these sections as they are not relevant. However, the foundational strength of Essay A's research question and its meticulous approach to experimental design and variable control demonstrate a higher level of scientific engagement and planning. The depth and specificity of the exploration in Essay A outweigh the completeness-by-omission of Essay B in the S/E/E sections, making Essay A the stronger example for Criterion B.",
