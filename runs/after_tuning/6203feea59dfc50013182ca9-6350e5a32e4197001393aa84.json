  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it presents a much more focused and scientifically rigorous investigation, which is the core of Criterion B. Although Essay B has a more thorough safety, ethical, and environmental section, its experimental design is fundamentally flawed.\n\nEssay A's strength lies in its clear and controlled experimental design. The research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is highly focused. This focus is maintained in the controlled variables, where the essay explicitly states its plan to control the water source: \"Water sample | Using the same water sample for all three pH variations\". This ensures that the effect of the independent variable (pH) on the dependent variable (BOD) can be isolated and validly measured. The background information is also directly relevant, providing a clear chemical basis for the Winkler method and a hypothesis linking pH to BOD.\n\nConversely, Essay B's investigation is critically flawed by a lack of variable control. Its research question asks how NaCl concentration affects dissolved oxygen \"of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources\". By design, it introduces a major confounding variable\u2014the water source (River, Stream, Lake)\u2014which inherently contains different levels of organic matter, microbial life, and other solutes. This makes it impossible to conclude that any observed changes in dissolved oxygen are solely due to the NaCl concentration. The methodology and analysis attempt to treat these as comparable samples, which undermines the scientific validity of the entire exploration.\n\nWhile Essay B demonstrates better practice in addressing safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, this does not compensate for its weak experimental design. Essay B explicitly states, \"No animal or human being was harmed for the success of this experiment,\" and provides specific disposal instructions: \"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\". Essay A, in contrast, completely omits any ethical considerations and its environmental note is weak: \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory\". However, the primary focus of Criterion B is the quality of the scientific exploration itself. Essay A proposes a sound, well-controlled experiment that can effectively answer its research question, whereas Essay B's design is invalid from the outset.",
