  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B, primarily due to its comprehensive and rigorous approach to the experimental design and safety considerations, which are critical components of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the foundational elements, both essays present strong, focused research questions. Essay A's question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is highly specific, detailing the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (BOD), timescale, and the precise analytical technique. Essay B's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is also effective, using evaluative language (\"To what extent\") and listing the specific substances to be tested. Both also provide relevant and detailed background information that successfully grounds their respective hypotheses in established chemical principles (redox reactions for Essay A, colligative properties for Essay B).\n\nHowever, the quality diverges significantly in the methodology and safety sections. Essay A's methodology is detailed, logical, and appropriate for a complex chemical analysis, including steps for sample preparation, titration, and incubation. In contrast, Essay B's method has a potential flaw in its sequential timing of trials (\"Start a 15-minute timer for the first ice cube... Repeat steps 11-12 for KCl\"), which could introduce uncontrolled variables if ambient conditions change, whereas a parallel design would be more robust.\n\nThe most critical distinction lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A, being an experimental investigation with hazardous chemicals, correctly includes a detailed safety section. It features a table listing specific chemicals and their risks (e.g., for H\u2082SO\u2084: \"Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\") and outlines personal protective equipment used (\"safety goggles, lab coat and gloves were worn\"). It also explicitly addresses environmental disposal, stating that waste was \"disposed off in basin of school laboratory,\" which, while perhaps imperfect, shows clear consideration. Essay B, also an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety or ethical considerations and provides only a negligible statement on the environment (\"Clean the tools and put them back\"). This is a major failure for an experimental IA, as acknowledging and mitigating risk is a fundamental requirement.\n\nTherefore, while both essays start on strong footing with their research questions and background, Essay A demonstrates a much higher level of scientific diligence through its more robust methodology and, most importantly, its thorough and specific engagement with safety and environmental protocols, making it the better submission for Criterion B.",
