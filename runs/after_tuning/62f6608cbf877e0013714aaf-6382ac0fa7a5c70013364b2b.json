  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B primarily due to its sophisticated theoretical background and its precise understanding of experimental design, particularly in the identification of variables. Essay A's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is directly and thoroughly supported by its background section. This section doesn't just list facts; it derives the necessary equations, such as the linearized Arrhenius equation (`\\ln k=\\frac{-E_{a}}{R T}+\\ln A`) and the second-order integrated rate law (`\\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t`), demonstrating a deep understanding that directly informs the methodology. In contrast, Essay B's background is more narrative, focusing on personal motivation (\"I was enrolled in a Jain school\") and providing the relevant chemical equations without a similarly deep theoretical justification for comparing the two chosen methods.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A correctly identifies all its variables. For instance, the independent variable is clearly stated as \"The absolute temperature at which the reaction is carried out\". Essay B, however, demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding by identifying its independent variable as \"Mass of sample before titrating\" and \"Mass of sample before heating.\" In reality, the mass is a controlled variable, while the *source* of the sample (chalk, rangoli, seashell) is the true independent variable being compared. This error in experimental design principles is a significant weakness for Essay B.\n\nWhile both essays propose appropriate methodologies for their questions, Essay A's approach to studying reaction kinetics is arguably more complex and shows greater chemical insight than the quantitative analysis in Essay B. Finally, both essays have good safety and environmental considerations, but Essay A is more complete by explicitly addressing all three required components, stating there are \"no notable ethical... issues,\" whereas Essay B omits any mention of ethics. Overall, Essay A's strong theoretical foundation and correct application of scientific principles make it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
