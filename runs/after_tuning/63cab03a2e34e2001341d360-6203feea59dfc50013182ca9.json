  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its significantly more focused and scientifically rigorous research question and experimental design. Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", clearly defines a measurable independent variable (pH), a dependent variable (BOD), a specific timeframe, and the analytical method. In contrast, Essay A's research question is convoluted: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler's method?\". This question confusingly mentions using \"secondary data\" while the methodology is entirely experimental, and it uses a qualitative, unquantified concept (\"pollution level\") as its basis for comparison.\n\nEssay B further excels in its identification and control of variables. The independent variable is precisely defined with target ranges: \"acidic pH of 3.0 - 4.0\" and \"alkaline pH of 9.0 \u2013 10.0\". Its controlled variables are presented in a clear table that not only lists them but also explains *how* they will be controlled. While Essay A correctly identifies its variables, the independent variable (\"4 different Water bodies\") is less controlled and relies on assumptions about pollution levels rather than a systematically manipulated variable.\n\nBoth essays provide detailed and appropriate methodologies for the Winkler method, and both include strong, specific risk assessments for the chemicals used. Essay A's inclusion of a procedure for standardizing sodium thiosulfate demonstrates a high level of chemical technique. However, both essays are comparable in their slightly generic statements on environmental disposal, with Essay B stating waste was disposed \"in basin of school laboratory\" and Essay A noting \"Laboratory standards were followed\". Ultimately, the superior clarity, focus, and scientific rigor of Essay B's research question and experimental design establish a much stronger foundation for the investigation, making it the better submission for Criterion B.",
