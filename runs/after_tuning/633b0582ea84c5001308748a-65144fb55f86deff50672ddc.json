  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The initial assessment identifies Essay A as a data-based investigation and Essay B as an experimental one, which is crucial for evaluating the criteria. Essay B presents a significantly stronger research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (kJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This RQ is exemplary as it specifies the exact independent variables (a list of ions), includes units for both variables, and details the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this high level of detail and specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section is more comprehensive and directly underpins its complex experimental procedure by explaining d-orbital splitting, the role of ligands, and the function of a spectrophotometer. Essay A's background is relevant but covers more foundational concepts. Methodologically, Essay B provides a detailed, step-by-step experimental plan that is appropriate and replicable. Essay A's methodology is suitable for a database investigation, stating it will use \"ChemPub and Chemeo\", but it is inherently less complex than designing a full experiment.\n\nFinally, as an experimental investigation, Essay B is required to address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, and it does so effectively. It provides specific safety warnings (\"Metal sulphates can irritate skin and eyes\"), ethical disposal methods (\"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\"), and environmental impact awareness (\"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life\"). While Essay A is not penalized for omitting these sections due to its data-based nature, Essay B's thorough inclusion of these elements demonstrates a more comprehensive and well-considered exploration. Overall, Essay B is superior due to its highly detailed research question, deeper background integration, and comprehensive experimental planning.",
