  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger than Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B due to its superior experimental design, control of variables, and comprehensive consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a more focused and scientifically rigorous research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This question is highly specific, detailing the exact temperatures and concentrations to be used. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction...\", is clear but less tightly defined within the question itself.\n\nSecond, the methodology and control of variables in Essay A are far more robust. The experiment is a classic, controllable solution chemistry investigation. The author details preliminary experiments to refine the method, noting \"nitric acid was added as it causes solutions of Fe\u00b3\u207a(aq) to have a paler colour\". This foresight and problem-solving demonstrate a high level of engagement. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, explaining not just *what* will be controlled, but *why* and *how* with specific equipment like a \"5.00 cm\u00b3 (\u00b10.05 cm\u00b3) graduated pipette\". Essay B's methodology, while creative, involves baking, a process with many difficult-to-control variables like oven \"hot spots\", which the student rightly identifies as a weakness. The control over variables in a simple aqueous system (Essay A) is inherently greater than in a complex food matrix (Essay B).\n\nFinally, Essay A provides a much more thorough treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, as expected for an experimental investigation with hazardous chemicals. It specifically identifies chemical hazards (\"Potassium thiocyanate is harmful by inhalation...Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\") and outlines proper disposal (\"Before discharge into sewage plants, iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised\"). Essay B's \"Risk Assessment\" is comparatively brief, focusing only on physical hazards like the oven and omitting any mention of chemical disposal, environmental impact, or ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw. While Essay B's background research identifying a gap in the literature is commendable, Essay A's overall exploration, from its focused question to its rigorous and safe design, is of a higher quality.",
