  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of proficiency in Criterion B, making this a close comparison. Essay A's research question is highly specific, stating, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration... measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This level of detail is excellent. Its methodology is well-justified, particularly the choice of a lux sensor over other methods, and its environmental considerations are commendable, as it notes, \"the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint.\"\n\nHowever, Essay B presents a slightly more thorough and well-supported exploration. Its research question is equally strong: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". The background information is exceptionally detailed, directly linking chemical principles like Le Chatelier's Principle to the deprotonation of functional groups on the orange peel, providing a robust theoretical foundation. The methodology is strengthened by a dedicated \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which justifies choices such as the pH range and contact time. Furthermore, Essay B's consideration of control variables is exemplary, including subtle but important factors like the \"Brand of Oranges used\" and a detailed \"Pre-treatment of Orange Peels\". Finally, Essay B explicitly addresses all three required considerations, stating \"No ethical concerns were raised,\" whereas Essay A omits an explicit ethical statement. While Essay A's safety section is more detailed, Essay B's overall completeness and the depth of its chemical background and variable control make it the superior piece of work.",
