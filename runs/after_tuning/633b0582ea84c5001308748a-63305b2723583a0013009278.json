  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured plans for their respective investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior grasp of the requirements for Criterion B.\n\n**Research Question:** Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is exemplary. It is focused, precise, and includes the specific independent variable values and a key controlled variable (time), making the scope of the investigation very clear. Essay A's research question is split into two parts: \"1. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion? 2. Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its boiling point?\". While clear, it lacks the specificity of Essay B; it doesn't state the range of alcohols to be studied, although this is mentioned later in the methodology.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Essay B outlines a detailed, step-by-step experimental procedure, including specific quantities (\"100 ml of 0.8M solution\") and a clear diagram of the setup. Its table of controlled variables is thorough, explaining not just *what* will be controlled, but *how*. Essay A, being a database study, has a less complex methodology but correctly identifies reliable sources (\"ChemPub and Chemeo,\" \"NIST\") and acknowledges the need to process the data (\"when the data was given in a range, I took its midpoint\"). Both identify their variables correctly, but Essay B's treatment of controlled variables is more comprehensive.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** This is where Essay B truly excels and demonstrates a key difference. As an experimental investigation, it appropriately includes a detailed \"Safety Practices\" section (\"Gloves were worn... well-ventilated space... Safety goggles\") and an \"Environmental Issues\" section (\"Zinc sulphate heptahydrate is toxic... disposed as a hazardous waste,\" \"batteries... were recycled\"). This shows a thorough understanding of laboratory risks and responsibilities. Essay A, as a database study, does not have direct safety or environmental risks associated with its procedure. While this is understandable, a statement acknowledging that these factors are not applicable would have been beneficial for completeness.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A presents a solid plan for a database investigation, Essay B is superior due to its more focused research question and its exemplary, detailed handling of variables, methodology, and especially safety and environmental considerations appropriate for its experimental nature.",
