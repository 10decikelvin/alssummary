  "reasoning": "Both essays present a clear research question and methodology. However, Essay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of NaCl solution affect the amount of time it takes for a potato cube to reach equilibrium?\" is slightly stronger as it specifies the range of concentrations to be tested (0 M to 1.0 M). Essay A's RQ, \"How does varying the concentration of NaCl solution affect the change in mass of the potato cube?\" is clear but lacks this specific range. In terms of methodology, both are well-detailed. Essay B outlines the preparation of NaCl solutions precisely, stating \"Measure out 5.8g of NaCl using a weighing scale and dissolve it into 100mL of distilled water in a volumetric flask to create a 1 M NaCl solution.\" and then describes the serial dilution process. Essay A's procedure is also detailed, but less precise in its measurements initially (\"A potato was cut into 9 cubes of 2cm x 2cm x 2cm using a ruler and a knife.\"). For risk assessment, both essays are comparable, identifying risks like sharp tools and chemical spills, and suggesting appropriate precautions. However, Essay A includes a 'Data Collection' section that clearly tabulates the expected measurements, which is a strength not present in Essay B. Despite this, Essay B's more specific and replicable methodology in preparing the solutions gives it a slight edge.",
