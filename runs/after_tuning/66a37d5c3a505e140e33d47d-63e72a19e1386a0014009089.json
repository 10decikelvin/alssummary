  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured investigations. Essay B has a stronger scientific foundation, with a highly specific research question (\"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...\") and a more detailed background section that explains concepts like dipole-induced dipole forces and the \"salting out effect.\" The methodology in Essay B is also robust, detailing the preparation of standard solutions and the specific steps of the Winkler titration.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior in its overall fulfillment of the Criterion B requirements. Its research question is also strong, specifying temperatures, juice types, and the analytical method: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices...measured by redox titration?\". While its background is less detailed than Essay B's, it is still relevant and sufficient. The key differentiator is the comprehensive treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides specific safety precautions (\"use of tongs to prevent skin burns,\" \"iodine may cause severe skin and eye irritation\"), a thoughtful ethical consideration (\"minimize the waste of such products\"), and an environmental note (\"heating plate...powered off and unplugged when it was not used\"). In contrast, Essay B, despite being an experimental investigation with chemical waste, completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental issues, which is a significant flaw. Therefore, because it addresses all aspects of the criterion more completely, Essay A is the better submission.",
