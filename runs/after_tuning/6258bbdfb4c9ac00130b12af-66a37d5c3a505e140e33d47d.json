  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and competent explorations. However, Essay A is superior due to its greater depth in methodology, justification, and risk assessment.\n\nFirst, while both research questions are well-formulated, Essay B's is slightly better framed: \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration measured by redox titration?\". This use of \"To what extent\" promotes a more evaluative conclusion. Essay A's is also strong and specific but less evaluative: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\".\n\nDespite this, Essay A excels in the depth of its experimental design and justification. The procedure involves two distinct and relatively complex analytical techniques (one requiring reflux), demonstrating a higher level of procedural complexity. Crucially, Essay A includes a dedicated \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains choices such as temperature range (\"frying oil is generally heated at those temperatures\"), chemical concentrations (\"a lower concentration of KOH was used to determine the acid value\"), and sample size. This demonstrates a thoughtful and proactive approach to experimental design that is not as explicit in Essay B.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's treatment of controlled variables and safety is more thorough. The controlled variables table in Essay A provides more detailed scientific reasoning in the \"Why to control?\" column, such as explaining that \"Light triggers decomposition of oil and allow formation of free fatty acids\". Essay A\u2019s risk assessment is also more comprehensive, identifying five specific hazards with detailed precautions, including chemical-specific risks like \"Hazardous liquids (HCl, KOH & ethanoic KOH)\" and procedure-specific risks like \"While reflux, there are chances of bursting of flask\". In contrast, Essay B's safety section is good but less detailed, covering more general hazards. Finally, Essay A's environmental consideration regarding the disposal of hazardous chemicals is more pertinent to a chemistry lab than Essay B's consideration of electricity usage from a hot plate.",
