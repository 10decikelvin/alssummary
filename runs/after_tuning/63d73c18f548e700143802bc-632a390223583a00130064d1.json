  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating a clear understanding of experimental design. Essay A is excellent, with a highly specific and focused research question: \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio (19, 3, 1, 0.333, 0.0526) on the buffering capacity...\". The background information is relevant and detailed, correctly incorporating the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and formulas for buffer capacity. The methodology is appropriate, and the variables are correctly identified and controlled. The safety, ethical, and environmental sections are all present and adequately addressed for an experimental investigation of this nature.\n\nHowever, Essay B is marginally superior due to its exceptional thoroughness and depth of planning. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also clear and specific. Where Essay B excels is in the detail of its methodology and variables. For instance, its controlled variables table is comprehensive, and crucially, it also identifies and discusses uncontrolled variables like the \"Uniform Depth of Sample\" and \"Rate of Water Evaporation,\" which demonstrates a deeper level of critical thought about the experiment's limitations. Furthermore, Essay B's ethical consideration regarding the \"Use of edible materials\" is more thoughtful and reflective than Essay A's simple statement of \"no ethical considerations.\" Finally, Essay B's environmental section provides a clear disposal plan, stating the bioplastics \"should be disposed of in a natural environment where they can undergo these processes,\" which is more specific than Essay A's justification.",
