  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's is more detailed, specifying the concentrations of bleach to be used, which fulfills the 'highly focused' criterion better. Both essays provide adequate background information relevant to their topics. However, Essay B's background section is more comprehensive, detailing the chemical reaction, the role of a spectrophotometer, and explaining how absorbance relates to concentration via the Beer-Lambert law. In contrast, Essay A only provides a summary of its results in the provided section, lacking detailed methodology or context. Regarding experimental design, Essay B outlines a clear and appropriate method, including the preparation of solutions and the use of a spectrophotometer for data collection. It also clearly identifies independent, dependent, and controlled variables, including specific details like the exact volume of bleach and dye. Essay A's methods are less detailed in the provided excerpt, and while it mentions a table for controlled variables, the content of that table is not fully provided. Finally, both submissions address safety, with Essay B offering a more thorough breakdown of chemical-specific hazards and responses. Essay B also explicitly mentions environmental considerations regarding chemical disposal, whereas Essay A's environmental comment is more general. Given the more detailed and well-supported methodology and background, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement.",
