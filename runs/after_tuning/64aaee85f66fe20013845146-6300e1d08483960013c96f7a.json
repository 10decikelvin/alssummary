  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable experimental investigations. Essay B's strength lies in its excellent background information, which clearly explains the underlying chemical principle of \"freezing point depression\" and even provides the relevant formula (`\u0394Tf = molality * Kf * i`). This theoretical foundation directly and logically supports its hypothesis. Essay A's background on caffeine and dichloromethane is relevant but more descriptive. However, Essay A demonstrates a more rigorous and well-controlled methodology. For instance, it specifies controlling the temperature of the tea solution, stating it will be recorded \"at 35\u00b0C before adding dichloromethane,\" which shows a thoughtful approach to experimental design.\n\nThe deciding factor is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are mandatory for experimental investigations. Essay A includes specific and relevant safety precautions directly related to its primary hazardous chemical, stating, \"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane as it can cause several skin issues and irritations\" and \"Wear a mask for protection because dichloromethane causes several health issues if inhaled\". While it fails to address environmental or ethical aspects, it correctly identifies and mitigates the primary risks. In contrast, Essay B completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. This is a critical flaw in an experimental report, as even simple procedures with low-risk salts require basic safety protocols like wearing safety glasses.\n\nTherefore, although Essay B has a stronger theoretical background, Essay A is the superior essay for Criterion B. Its methodology is more detailed, and its inclusion of crucial safety protocols demonstrates a more complete and responsible approach to experimental exploration, which outweighs the total omission of this section in Essay B.",
