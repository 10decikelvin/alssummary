  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its comprehensive and well-structured approach, particularly in the methodology and background information sections. While both essays state a clear research question, Essay B's question, 'How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?', is more scientifically rigorous and is supported by a detailed theoretical background, including the relevant formula (c = Q / (m\u0394T)) and expected outcomes based on existing knowledge. The methodology in Essay B is meticulously outlined in a step-by-step manner, making the experiment easy to replicate. In contrast, Essay A's methodology is incomplete, as it describes how to prepare the candles but crucially omits how the 'burning time' (the dependent variable) will be measured. Furthermore, Essay B\u2019s identification of variables is more thorough, explaining not just *what* will be controlled, but *how*. While both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns, Essay B's overall scientific planning and detail are significantly more developed and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the experimental process.",
