  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent investigations, but Essay B is superior due to its significantly greater depth, scientific rigor, and personal engagement.\n\n**Research Question & Background:** Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-focused and detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2 in the degradation of Methyl Orange, in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This specificity is a hallmark of a strong investigation. The background information is comprehensive, citing literature to explain the Photo-Fenton reaction, the proposed rate mechanism, and the critical \"scavenging effect\" of H2O2, which directly informs the experimental design. In contrast, Essay A's research question, while clear, is less complex. Its background on complexometric titration is adequate but lacks the depth and synthesis of scientific literature seen in Essay B.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Essay B demonstrates superior methodological planning. It explicitly justifies the chosen concentration range for its independent variable, stating, \"...by choosing values of [H2O2] lesser then 2.93 mmol dm\u207b\u00b3, we will be able to circumvent anomalies caused by the scavenging effect of H2O2...\". Furthermore, it includes a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, showing a process of refinement to ensure data quality, which is an excellent practice. Essay A has a reasonable methodology and a good justification for choosing titration over other methods, and its variables are well-controlled. However, the description of the dependent variable measurement is slightly convoluted, and it lacks the evidence of refinement seen in Essay B.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Essay A is more complete in this section, as it explicitly addresses all three components. It states, \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved in the experiment,\" and also considers the environmental impact of food wastage. Essay B provides good safety (\"googles were worn when the UV-Lamp was in operation\") and environmental details (\"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\") but completely omits a statement on ethical considerations.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite Essay A's more complete coverage of the S/E/E section, Essay B's overall scientific quality is far higher. The sophisticated research question, deeply researched background, and meticulously planned methodology (including preliminary trials and literature-based justifications) demonstrate a much stronger grasp of the scientific process. The minor omission in the S/E/E section of Essay B does not outweigh its substantial strengths in the core aspects of the investigation.",
