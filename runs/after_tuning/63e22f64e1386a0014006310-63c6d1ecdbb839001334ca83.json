  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental plans. Essay A has a very well-structured approach with a two-part research question and a detailed table of controlled variables that clearly explains why and how each is controlled. However, it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a significant weakness for an experiment involving chemicals. Essay B, on the other hand, presents a single, highly focused research question: \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\" This question is exemplary in its specificity, defining the independent variable, its range, the dependent variable, and the method of measurement. The background information in Essay B provides a strong real-world context and justifies the choice of reagents. Crucially, Essay B includes a dedicated section for \"Safety, Ethical and Environmental issues,\" addressing each component thoughtfully. For example, it notes that KMnO\u2084 is \"'Toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects'\" and should be disposed of in a \"sealable container,\" demonstrating a thorough consideration of the investigation's impact. While Essay A's methodology is good, Essay B's comprehensive approach, particularly its attention to all aspects of the investigation including safety, ethics, and environmental impact, makes it the superior submission for this criterion.",
