  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable experimental investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of quality and thoroughness in its exploration, making it the superior submission.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core of the investigation\u2014the research question, background, and variables\u2014Essay B is more robust. Essay A's research question, \"How do different active ingredients...in different brands...compare in the volume...of 1M HCl they can neutralise,\" is clear and focused. Essay B's question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas,\" is similarly strong. However, Essay B excels in its identification and control of variables. It not only lists relevant controlled variables but provides specific and thoughtful justifications, such as controlling the surface area of the catalyst by stating, \"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure.\" This demonstrates a meticulous approach to experimental design. In contrast, Essay A makes a conscious choice not to control the mass of the antacid tablet (\"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation\"), which, while justified, introduces a significant uncontrolled variable that weakens the scientific rigor of the comparison between brands.\n\nSecond, the methodology of Essay B is more sophisticated and shows greater personal engagement. The student justifies their unconventional approach to measuring rate, stating, \"I was curious to see how I could alter the concept of rate to variate from standard practice.\" This personal input, combined with a detailed and repeatable procedure, elevates the work. Essay A's methodology is a standard titration procedure, which is appropriate but lacks the same level of detailed consideration seen in Essay B.\n\nFinally, Essay B's handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is significantly more detailed and specific. Essay A's safety section is generic: \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\" Essay B, however, provides specific risks for each chemical and explains how these risks were mitigated, citing a source: \"To reduce risk for this investigation, 3% H\u2082O\u2082 solution was used (CLEAPPS, 'Hydrogen Peroxide').\" Similarly, its environmental section references the \"12 Principles of Green Chemistry\" and details a specific disposal plan, which is much more thorough than Essay A's general instruction to use a \"special waste beaker.\"\n\nIn summary, while Essay A presents a competent investigation, Essay B is superior due to its more rigorous control of variables, deeper engagement with the methodology, and far more specific and well-researched safety and environmental considerations.",
