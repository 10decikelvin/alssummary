  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations, but Essay A demonstrates a higher quality of exploration overall. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is highly effective because its evaluative nature (\"to what extent\") is directly justified by its excellent background section, which compares the Winkler method to other techniques like sensors and colorimetric tests. This provides a strong, focused rationale for the investigation. In contrast, while Essay B's research question is also clear and focused, its background is more descriptive than analytical.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are strong, but Essay A's inclusion of insights from preliminary trials (\"During preliminary trials I found that when collecting the sample of water from the tap, the water stream should be slow and constant as not to aerate the water...\") showcases a more developed and reflective experimental design process. Essay B's methodology is detailed, but the instruction to alter pH by adding \"6 drops of HCl\" lacks the precision expected at this level, even if a pH meter is used afterward.\n\nThe most significant distinction lies in the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A addresses all three components explicitly and specifically. It correctly states, \"There are no major ethical issues surrounding the investigation,\" and provides a clear environmental disposal instruction: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\". Essay B, however, completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a critical flaw. Furthermore, its environmental statement, \"...disposed off in basin of school laboratory...\", is vague and does not demonstrate sufficient consideration for responsible chemical disposal. Due to its superior justification for the research question and its complete and specific fulfillment of all S/E/E requirements, Essay A is the better submission.",
