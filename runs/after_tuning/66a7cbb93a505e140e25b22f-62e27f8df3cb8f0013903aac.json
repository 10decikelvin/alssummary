  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior across all assessed elements of Criterion B. The research question in Essay B is exceptionally well-defined and focused: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter...\". This level of detail, including concentrations, the specific temperature range, and the precise measurement technique, far exceeds that of Essay A's question, which, while clear, lacks this specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section provides a thorough and relevant theoretical framework, discussing the reaction mechanism, rate laws, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are essential for its complex investigation. In contrast, Essay A's background is adequate but far simpler, focusing only on basic neutralisation. Essay B's methodology is also more rigorous, incorporating preliminary testing to justify choices like temperature range and equipment handling.\n\nA significant weakness in Essay A lies in its identification of variables, where it confusingly lists \"Mass of indigestion tablets\" as an independent variable but then states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet.\" This indicates a misunderstanding of experimental design. Essay B, conversely, presents a comprehensive and well-justified list of independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are exemplary, providing a detailed, chemical-specific risk assessment: \"Pure Propanone...- Highly flammable... To mitigate these risks, do not heat directly.\" Essay A's considerations are much more generic: \"...gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\"",
