  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough approach to Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its exceptionally well-defined research question and methodology for an experimental investigation. The research question is not just clear but highly specific, stating, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration.\" This level of detail, specifying the exact independent variable range and the dependent variable measurement techniques, sets a strong foundation. In contrast, Essay B's research questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this high degree of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed, appropriate, and meticulously planned. It includes procedures for preparing and standardizing solutions, controlling heating, and performing titrations. The controlled variables are presented in an outstanding table that not only lists them but explains *how* and *why* each is controlled, such as for moisture: \"Same brand oil with the same environment condition will be used\" to control for its effect on free fatty acid content. Essay B's methodology is appropriate for its data-based investigation, correctly identifying reliable sources like \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook,\" but it cannot demonstrate the same level of experimental design skill.\n\nFinally, as an experimental investigation, Essay A requires a thorough risk assessment, which it delivers flawlessly. It identifies specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"Hazardous liquids (HCl, KOH & ethanoic KOH)\" and provides concrete precautionary measures. It also explicitly and thoughtfully addresses both ethical (\"oil... was not either wasted or used in excess\") and environmental considerations (\"All prepared chemicals were either disposed of with lab guidelines\"). While Essay B is a competent data-based study where these considerations are not required, Essay A's excellent execution of these crucial components for its investigation type highlights its overall superiority in planning and exploration.",
