  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong work for Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and a more sophisticated approach.\n\n**Research Question & Background:** Both essays have clear, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"What is the average rate of reaction... of 0.5 g of crushed antacids... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations... measured through the production of CO2... in 2 minutes?\" This is specific and measurable. Essay B's question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...\" is also excellent and investigates a more complex chemical concept (activation energy). Essay B's background is superior because it provides a detailed reaction mechanism and explicitly links the Arrhenius equation and Beer-Lambert law to its methodology, demonstrating a deeper theoretical understanding than Essay A's more general discussion of collision theory.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:** Both essays outline appropriate methodologies and correctly identify variables. Essay A's use of gas collection is a classic, viable method. Essay B's use of colorimetry to determine the initial rate of reaction is more technically demanding and well-suited to its RQ. Both essays impressively include a \"Pre-test\" or \"Preliminary Testing\" section, showing a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design. For example, Essay A states, \"I noticed that the rate of reaction... was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution, due to this I decided to use lower concentrations.\" Similarly, Essay B notes, \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data... so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" This demonstrates excellent scientific practice in both cases.\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays are experimental and provide thorough considerations. Essay A presents a clear safety table and explicitly addresses environmental disposal (\"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\") and ethics (\"This experiment has no ethical considerations...\"). Essay B provides a very detailed, chemical-by-chemical breakdown of safety and environmental risks, including for the product, iodopropanone, and notes, \"Dispose according to local legislation.\" While Essay B doesn't use the specific heading \"Ethical Considerations,\" its focus on minimizing waste and proper disposal covers the key principles.\n\nOverall, Essay B is stronger due to the greater complexity of its research question and the depth of its theoretical background, which is seamlessly integrated into the justification for its methodology. While Essay A is a very competent and well-executed investigation, Essay B tackles a more advanced topic with greater chemical insight.",
