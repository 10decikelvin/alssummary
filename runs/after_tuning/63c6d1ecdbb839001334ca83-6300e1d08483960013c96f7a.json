  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more scientifically rigorous investigation than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...?\", is precise, defining the exact independent variable levels. Its methodology is detailed, replicable, and uses appropriate volumetric glassware for accuracy. Essay A also includes a comprehensive section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, noting that HCl is an irritant and that KMnO\u2084 requires specific disposal. In contrast, Essay B's methodology is significantly weaker; it fails to specify how the volume of melted water will be separated from the remaining ice for measurement, a critical flaw. Additionally, Essay B completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major failing for an experimental investigation. While both have adequate background sections, the superior experimental design and inclusion of all required sections make Essay A the clear winner.",
