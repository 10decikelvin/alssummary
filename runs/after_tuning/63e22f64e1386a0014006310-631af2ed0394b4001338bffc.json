  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of detail, scientific engagement, and adherence to IB assessment criteria across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, evaluating the foundational elements, Essay B's research question (\"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\") is more sophisticated and original than Essay A's standard investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's background is significantly more detailed and scientifically rigorous, discussing complex concepts like \"phosphoserine residues in caseins\" and the role of equilibria, citing multiple sources. In contrast, Essay A's background on homologous series and combustion is adequate but lacks this depth.\n\nSecond, while both methodologies are appropriate for their respective research questions, Essay B's design is more thorough. It includes a detailed table of controlled variables that explains not just *what* is controlled but *why* and *how*. Essay B also thoughtfully includes a section on uncontrolled variables (\"Colour assessment during titration\", \"Storage conditions of milk\"), which demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking about the experimental design than Essay A.\n\nFinally, the most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B comprehensively addresses all three aspects. It details safety protocols for corrosive substances (\"Ammonia solution was handled with caution and only under a fume cupboard\"), explicitly addresses environmental impact (\"The ammonia buffer solution can be toxic to the aquatic life...diluted with extensive quantities of water before disposal\"), and correctly notes ethical considerations (\"No ethical concerns were identified...\"). Essay A provides a good safety assessment for handling flammable alcohols, but it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for an experimental investigation. This omission, combined with its less sophisticated background and variable analysis, makes it significantly weaker than Essay B.",
