  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a more thorough and well-developed plan for the investigation across all assessed areas of Criterion B.\n\nWhile both essays present focused and relevant research questions, Essay B's is significantly more detailed and precise: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration.\" This immediately establishes the exact conditions and analytical methods, which is superior to Essay A's simpler question: \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\".\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is more rigorous. It outlines detailed procedures for standardizing reagents and conducting two separate titrations, including a reflux step. It also includes a \"Justification for methodology\" section, explaining choices like the temperature range. In contrast, Essay A's method relies on subjective visual assessment for its endpoint (\"determined by the naked eye\"), which is a significant weakness. Essay B's identification of variables is also more comprehensive, presented in a clear table that explains not only *how* variables are controlled but *why*, such as controlling \"Light\" because it \"triggers decomposition of oil\".\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a much stronger consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. Essay A gives good safety and environmental disposal instructions (\"iodine solutions need to be disposed of in the inorganic waste\"), but it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations. Essay B, however, addresses all three components explicitly. Its safety section is detailed with specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and its ethical section directly states, \"There were no ethical issues in this investigation.\" This comprehensive approach makes Essay B a much stronger example of a well-planned scientific investigation.",
