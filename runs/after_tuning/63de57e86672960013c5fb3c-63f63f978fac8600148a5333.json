  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured experimental investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and chemical understanding, making it superior.\n\nFirst, evaluating the core scientific foundation, Essay B's research question is exceptionally detailed: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This is stronger than Essay A's question because it not only specifies the variables and their ranges but also the precise analytical technique used for quantification. Furthermore, Essay B's background information is significantly more advanced, delving into the specific chemical mechanisms of biosorption, such as how \"carboxylate groups (-RCOO-), carboxylic groups (-COOH) and hydroxyl groups... serve as viable binding sites\" and explaining how pH affects the equilibrium of these groups via deprotonation. This is a much deeper chemical exploration than Essay A's correct but more standard explanation of electrolysis.\n\nSecond, regarding the methodology and experimental design, Essay B again excels. It explicitly details its \"Preliminary Trials,\" showing a reflective and iterative design process to address issues like the precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide above pH 5.4. Essay B also identifies and controls a more extensive list of variables with clearer justification, such as \"Brand of Oranges used\" and \"Pre-treatment of Orange Peels\" to ensure uniformity. While Essay A's methodology is appropriate and its variable control is good, Essay B's approach, which includes creating a calibration curve and using a spectrophotometer, represents a more sophisticated and precise analytical procedure compared to the direct mass measurement in Essay A.\n\nFinally, while both essays adequately address safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations, Essay B's overall scientific merit is far greater. Essay A does provide more detail on specific chemical hazards, stating \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive and viscous liquid.\" However, Essay B's environmental disposal instruction to place solutions in the \"appropriate heavy metals disposal area\" is more professionally sound than Essay A's suggestion to flush copper sulphate solution \"down the drain with plenty of water.\" Ultimately, the profound depth of the background chemistry and the meticulous, sophisticated experimental design in Essay B far outweigh any minor differences in the S/E/E sections, making it the better essay.",
