  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality and thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, the foundational research question and background of Essay B are far superior. Essay B presents a highly specific and focused research question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". This question is exemplary because it precisely defines the independent variable with its range, the dependent variable, and a key controlled parameter. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is vague and does not clearly articulate that the investigation is about buffer capacity, nor does it specify the temperature range. Essay B's background is also more comprehensive, linking theory like Faraday's Law directly to the hypothesis and citing previous studies, whereas Essay A's background is adequate but less developed.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology and handling of variables are significantly more rigorous. The procedure in Essay B is logical, detailed, and easily replicable. Its description of controlled variables is excellent, providing clear methods for control, such as for the distance between electrodes: \"using a wooden splint placed across the beaker... it is easy to discern the distance between the two electrodes.\" Essay A's methodology is confusingly organized, with steps presented in a non-sequential order (e.g., step \u2464 before step \u2463). Furthermore, its dependent variable, \"Change of pH of a 50.0 cm\u00b3 of an Acetate buffer,\" is poorly defined compared to Essay B's precise \"Percentage Mass Increase\".\n\nFinally, and most critically for an experimental investigation, Essay B properly addresses safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, while Essay A fails to do so. Essay B provides specific safety precautions for named chemicals (\"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive... wear gloves, a lab coat, and a pair of safety glasses\"), explicitly addresses ethics (\"There are no ethical issues\"), and details environmental impact and disposal (\"Copper sulphate is a pesticide... the acid must be neutralized first then disposed of\"). Essay A's safety section is critically incomplete, offering only one partial point on acetic acid, and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw.",
