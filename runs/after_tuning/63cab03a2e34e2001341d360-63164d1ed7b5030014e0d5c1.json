  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it presents a more focused and methodologically sound scientific exploration from its foundation. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its research question: \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\". This question is clear, focused, testable, and uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\"), which is indicative of a higher-level investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question is convoluted: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\". This RQ confusingly mentions \"secondary data\" despite being an experimental lab and has a qualitative independent variable (\"source of water\") that is difficult to systematically control.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B demonstrates a stronger grasp of variable control. It identifies a clear, quantitative independent variable (\"Time spent in the water bath\") and provides a well-justified list of controlled variables, such as \"Type and brand of bell pepper\" and \"Temperature Of Water Bath\". While Essay A correctly identifies its variables, its independent variable (\"4 different Water bodies\") is inherently less controlled. Both essays provide detailed, appropriate methodologies and relevant background information explaining the underlying chemistry.\n\nFinally, Essay B is more complete in its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. It explicitly addresses all three, stating for ethics and environment, \"No significant ethical concerns,\" which is the expected standard. Essay A has a very strong and detailed safety assessment but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations and provides only a generic statement on environmental impact (\"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals\"). The superior research question and more thorough consideration of all Criterion B aspects make Essay B the better submission.",
