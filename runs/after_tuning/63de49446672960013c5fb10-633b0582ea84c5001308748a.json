  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of exploration and scientific engagement, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is highly specific, focused, and uses evaluative language ('to what extent'), setting the stage for a sophisticated investigation. In contrast, Essay B's two research questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this evaluative depth. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is a standout feature, detailing the rationale behind complex procedures like complexation with copper(II) sulfate and the use of Crystal Violet and SDS for micelle formation. The inclusion of a \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which documents problem-solving for issues like precipitate formation, showcases a high degree of personal engagement and scientific rigor. While Essay B\u2019s data-based methodology is appropriate for its research question, identifying sources like \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook\", it is inherently less complex than designing, troubleshooting, and executing a hands-on experiment. Essay A also excels in its identification of variables, providing an extensive list of specific controlled variables, such as \"The time each flask is exposed to the heat bath will be kept constant at 15 minutes\" and \"The same cuvette will be used for every trial,\" which is far more thorough than Essay B's single main control of using \"only linear primary alcohols.\" Finally, as an experimental investigation, Essay A correctly provides specific and relevant safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, stating \"Copper(II) sulfate can cause irritation to the eyes, so goggles must be worn\" and waste \"must be disposed of in the correct bin... according to state regulations.\" While the omission of these sections in the data-based Essay B is acceptable, their detailed inclusion in Essay A further solidifies its comprehensive fulfillment of Criterion B.",
