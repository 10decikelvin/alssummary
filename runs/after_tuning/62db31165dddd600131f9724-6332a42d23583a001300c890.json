  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it presents a complete and high-quality exploration that fully meets the requirements of Criterion B, while Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay B's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is far more detailed and focused than Essay A's simple question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\". Furthermore, Essay B provides a comprehensive background explaining the relevant kinetic theories, including the Arrhenius equation, which directly underpins its investigation. Most critically, Essay B includes a detailed methodology, a full list of materials, and a step-by-step procedure, which are entirely absent from Essay A. Essay B also excels in its identification of variables and its thorough treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. For example, its environmental section astutely notes that while some chemicals are harmless, \"Disposal of potassium hydroxide solution... can be hazardous to aquatic life\" and requires disposal as hazardous waste. In contrast, Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethics, or the environment, a major failure for an experimental investigation. While Essay A has a reasonable introduction, its fundamental lack of a methodology, variables list, and safety considerations makes it a significantly weaker submission.",
