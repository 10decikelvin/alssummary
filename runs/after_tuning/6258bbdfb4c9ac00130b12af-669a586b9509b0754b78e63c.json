  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, making this a close comparison. However, Essay B is marginally superior due to the exceptional quality and precision of its research question and its clear justification for methodological choices based on pre-testing.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, Essay B presents a model of clarity and specificity: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3), measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This question precisely defines the independent variable with its specific values, the dependent variable with its units, the mass of the reactant, and the duration of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value using method reflux titration and titration,\" is very good but uses less precise language (\"Investigating effect of...\") and is slightly less comprehensive.\n\nSecond, both essays provide relevant background information, appropriate methodologies, and excellent identification of variables. Essay A's \"Justification for methodology\" section is a significant strength, explaining the rationale for choices like chemical concentrations and sample sizes. Similarly, Essay B effectively uses a \"Pre-test\" section to justify its chosen concentration range and time frame, stating, \"I decided to use lower concentrations of HCl in order to achieve a clearer trend.\" This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative experimental design process.\n\nFinally, both essays thoroughly address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations appropriate for their experimental work. Essay B provides specific disposal instructions, noting, \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water,\" which adds a layer of practical detail. Essay A is also strong, stating chemicals \"were either disposed of with lab guidelines or they were kept in the lab for further use.\" While both are excellent, Essay B's combination of a flawlessly formulated research question and clear preliminary testing to refine its method gives it a slight edge in demonstrating a well-planned and focused investigation.",
