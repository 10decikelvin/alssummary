  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably better as it meets all the requirements for Criterion B with greater precision and completeness than Essay B. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally well-formulated, stating \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids... in HCl solutions of varying concentrations (0.050mol.dm^-3, 0.100mol dm^-3, 0.250mol dm^-3, 0.500mol dm^-3, 1.000mol dm^-3)... measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This single sentence precisely defines the independent variable with its specific levels, the dependent variable, and key controlled parameters, representing an exemplary level of detail. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction...\", is clear but lacks this immediate specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's exploration is strengthened by its inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section, which justifies the chosen range of concentrations and demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design. The most significant differentiator, however, lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides a detailed safety table for each chemical and explicitly addresses ethical and environmental aspects, including a specific disposal method: \"The excess HCl solutions were disposed of through the sink after further dilution with water\". Essay B, an experimental investigation, provides only a brief \"Risk Assessment\" for equipment and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw. While Essay B's methodology is ambitious and shows strong personal interest, Essay A's submission is more robust, methodologically sound, and holistically fulfills the IB criteria for exploration.",
