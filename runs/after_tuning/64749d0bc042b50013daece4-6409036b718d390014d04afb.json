  "reasoning": "Both essays represent high-quality experimental investigations and demonstrate a strong grasp of the requirements for Criterion B. Each presents a research question that is clear, focused, and appropriately detailed. Essay A asks, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", while Essay B asks, \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator...\". Both questions are excellent as they specify the exact ranges of the independent variables and the method of measurement.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of personal engagement and scientific curiosity in its exploration. The background links the complex BZ reaction to a novel real-world application, cardiac arrhythmia, which is a more sophisticated context than Essay A's connection to global warming. Crucially, Essay B includes a section on \"Choice of Materials and Method\" that details a thoughtful, iterative process of selecting the right equipment: \"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results... Subsequently, experimentation was done with a colourimeter... Ultimately... the built-in lux sensor in the data logger could determine the changes in colour\". This explicit articulation of methodological problem-solving is a hallmark of outstanding exploration, which Essay A lacks.\n\nFurthermore, while both essays have strong safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay B's approach is more personal and proactive. Essay A correctly details chemical hazards and disposal methods. Essay B also does this but adds a specific, quantifiable action taken to reduce environmental impact: \"Therefore, the volume of reagents was reduced by a factor of three, reducing the environmental and financial footprint of the IA.\" This demonstrates a higher level of thoughtful consideration beyond standard lab procedure.\n\nBoth essays feature excellent and well-justified tables of variables. Essay A's methodology is sound and appropriate, but it follows a more standard, well-established procedure. Essay B's methodology, developed through trial and error for a more complex reaction, shows greater independence and scientific maturity. For these reasons\u2014superior personal engagement in methodological design and more proactive environmental considerations\u2014Essay B is the better submission.",
