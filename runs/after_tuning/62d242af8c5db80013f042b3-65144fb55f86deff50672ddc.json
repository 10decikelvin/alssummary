  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay A is superior due to its more robust and appropriate methodology.\n\n**1. Research Question and Background:**\n- **Essay A:** Presents a clear and focused research question: \"How does the temperature... affect its calcium content... by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\" The background information is directly relevant, explaining the principles of complexometric titration and the effect of heat on calcium solubility, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the experiment.\n- **Essay B:** Has an excellent, sophisticated research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii... affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting... calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\" The background is highly detailed, explaining d-orbital splitting theory and ligand exchange reactions thoroughly. In this aspect, Essay B is slightly stronger.\n\n**2. Methodology and Variables:**\n- **Essay A:** The methodology is a well-considered back titration, which is appropriate for measuring calcium in a complex matrix like milk. The essay includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section, justifying the choice of titration over other techniques, which is a significant strength. The variables are presented in clear tables with excellent justifications for why each must be controlled (e.g., \"The rate of losing calcium ions will increase if the volume of the milk increases\").\n- **Essay B:** While the methodology appears sound initially, the student's own evaluation (which reflects on the initial planning) reveals critical flaws. For example, it acknowledges that for two of the chosen metals, the observed color change is likely due to oxidation, not the intended ligand exchange: \"the change in color from both metal complexes... is due to the oxidation of the metal... and was not a result of a ligand exchange reaction.\" Furthermore, it correctly notes that the assumed octahedral geometry for the copper complex is wrong: \"copper in the +2 oxidation state favors a square planar configuration... instead of the assumed [Cu(NH3)6]2+ structure.\" These are fundamental flaws in the experimental design that invalidate a significant portion of the proposed investigation. While it is good that the student identifies these later, it means the planned methodology is not fit for purpose for several of the chosen data points.\n\n**3. Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:**\n- **Essay A:** Provides a comprehensive and well-structured safety table, detailing specific hazards like ammonia causing \"corrosive injuries\" and corresponding precautions like using a \"fume cupboard.\" It also addresses ethical considerations (\"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved\") and environmental impact, noting the need to reduce \"food wastage.\"\n- **Essay B:** Addresses all three areas concisely. It correctly identifies hazards (\"Ammonium hydroxide, when inhaled, can irritate lungs\") and appropriate waste disposal (\"Dispose all solutions in inorganic waste bin\"). While sufficient, Essay A's presentation of safety is more thorough.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEssay B demonstrates a more ambitious and theoretically complex understanding. However, its experimental design is critically flawed for three of its five proposed data points (Fe, Mn, Cu), meaning the methodology is not appropriate to answer its own research question. Essay A, while perhaps simpler in concept, presents a sound, well-justified, and workable methodology that directly addresses its research question. The thoroughness of its planning, including the justification for the chosen method and the detailed control of variables, makes it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
