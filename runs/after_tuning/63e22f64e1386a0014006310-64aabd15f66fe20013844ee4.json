  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundational elements for Criterion B, with well-defined, specific, and focused research questions. Essay A's two-part research question, \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\", is excellent in its scope and detail, specifying the exact variables to be tested. Similarly, Essay B's question, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... measured in moldm-3 using acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\", is also highly effective due to its inclusion of the specific measurement technique and titrant concentration. Both essays provide relevant background information, appropriate methodologies, and thorough identification and control of variables.\n\nThe primary distinction between the two essays lies in their handling of safety considerations, which is a critical component for these experimental investigations. Essay A conducts a more hazardous experiment involving flammable alcohols and open flames, and its safety section reflects this appropriately. It identifies specific risks such as \"Spillage of alcohols: if the spirit burners were to drop and shatter, the alcohols will spill. These alcohols are highly flammable\" and provides concrete mitigation strategies like \"Have a fire blanket and a fire extinguisher nearby and accessible.\" This demonstrates a thorough and responsible risk assessment.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's safety section is significantly weaker and somewhat dismissive. It states, \"Gloves are not necessary for this experiment due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH Titre\" and concludes with \"No other special safety precautions are required\". This overlooks standard laboratory practice, such as wearing safety goggles during any chemical procedure, and downplays the potential hazards of even dilute bases. While both essays omit explicit discussion of ethical and environmental considerations (a shared weakness), Essay A's far superior and more detailed approach to safety\u2014the most critical of the three for its particular procedure\u2014makes it the stronger submission. The thoughtful risk assessment in Essay A demonstrates a higher level of engagement with the practical aspects of the investigation.",
