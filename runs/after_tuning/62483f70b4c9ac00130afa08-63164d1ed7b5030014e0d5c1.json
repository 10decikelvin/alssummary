  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B, but Essay A is superior due to its more sophisticated research process and greater detail in key areas. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is exceptionally well-justified by its background research. The author investigates and compares three different methods (colorimetric, sensors, and Winkler), which provides a strong, logical foundation for choosing to evaluate the Winkler method. In contrast, while Essay B's background on Vitamin C is relevant, it does not explore alternative methodologies to the same extent. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology section is strengthened by the inclusion of findings from \"preliminary trials,\" which demonstrates a more thorough and iterative exploration process. Both essays correctly identify variables and outline appropriate safety procedures for their respective experimental investigations. However, Essay A shows a more responsible and detailed approach to environmental considerations. While Essay B states, \"Environmental Concerns: No significant environmental concerns,\" Essay A provides a specific disposal protocol: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2.\" This higher level of detail in the background research, methodological refinement, and environmental stewardship makes Essay A the better example of Criterion B.",
