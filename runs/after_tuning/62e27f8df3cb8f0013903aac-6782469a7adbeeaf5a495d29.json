  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong Criterion B sections. Essay A's research question is exemplary, stating, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb).\" This is highly specific, outlining the variable, its range, and the method of measurement. Essay B's research question is similarly excellent, clearly defining its scope: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2...for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\".\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a superior depth of research and contextualization. It frames the investigation within a real-world environmental problem, stating, \"The release of dyes, like MO, into water bodies, accounts for nearly 20% of industrial water pollution.\" It also identifies a clear research gap, noting that \"the vast majority of these papers did not investigate the order of reaction, and used heterogenous catalysts...There hence exists a research gap regarding the kinetics of the reaction between just H2O2 and MO, in the absence of other catalysts.\" This level of engagement and justification elevates the quality of the exploration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is informed by advanced concepts found in its research. The choice of the independent variable range is explicitly justified to avoid a known chemical issue: \"by choosing values of [H2O2] lesser then 2.93 mmol dm\u207b\u00b3, we will be able to circumvent anomalies caused by the scavenging effect of H2O2.\" This shows a sophisticated understanding that directly impacts the experimental design. While Essay A's safety section is more detailed and well-formatted, detailing risks for each chemical, Essay B's stronger scientific rationale and contextual background make its overall exploration more compelling and demonstrate a higher level of independent inquiry.",
