  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is far more detailed and focused. It clearly states the independent variable, dependent variable, and key controlled variables: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". In contrast, Essay A's question is awkwardly phrased and less specific: \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\". Essay B's background is also vastly superior, providing detailed, relevant scientific context on Dissolved Oxygen and the chemical principles of the Winkler Method, including balanced equations like `2 Mn\u00b2\u207a(aq)+O\u2082(g)+4OH\u207b(aq) \u2192 2MnO\u2082(s)+2H\u2082O(l)`. Essay A\u2019s background is almost non-existent, consisting of a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\".\n\nSecond, the methodology and identification of variables in Essay B are exemplary. It presents variables in a clear table, correctly identifying Independent, Dependent, and Controlled variables with justifications. Its methodology is detailed, logical, and replicable. Conversely, Essay A completely fails to list or categorize its variables and provides an incomplete methodology that starts mid-procedure at step 6, with no explanation of how the independent variable (milk of different expiration dates) will be sourced or managed.\n\nFinally, both essays describe experimental investigations requiring full safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B excels by addressing all three areas specifically. It explicitly states ethical considerations (\"No animal or human being was harmed for the success of this experiment\") and provides specific environmental disposal instructions (\"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation\"). Essay A has a reasonable safety assessment but only provides a generic environmental note and completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a significant flaw. Essay B's comprehensive and well-structured approach to the entire exploration process makes it the clear winner.",
