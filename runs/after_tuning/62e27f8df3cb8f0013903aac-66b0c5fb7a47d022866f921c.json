  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its exceptional precision and depth across all assessed elements. Its research question is a model of clarity and specificity, stating: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This level of detail, including concentrations, variable ranges, and measurement techniques, far surpasses Essay B's broader question: \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\". Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is more sophisticated and its scientific justification is stronger. The use of preliminary trials (\"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data in the colorimeter, so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme\") shows a rigorous approach to experimental design. In contrast, Essay B uses simple calorimetry, a method known for high systematic error, and misidentifies the primary dependent variable as \"The total mass of the fuel burnt\" rather than the calculated enthalpy of combustion. While both essays have strong sections on controlled variables and environmental considerations, Essay A's chemical-specific safety table (\"Pure Propanone... Highly flammable... use acetone in a well-ventilated area, wear protective gloves and safety spectacles.\") is more thorough than Essay B's more general safety paragraph. Finally, Essay A\u2019s background section provides a much deeper theoretical foundation, explaining the reaction mechanism, rate laws, and the Arrhenius equation, which is essential for its investigation. Essay B\u2019s background is good contextually but lacks the same level of theoretical rigor.",
