  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B is the superior submission, primarily because it provides a complete experimental plan, whereas Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay A begins strongly with a clear research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", and an excellent background section that links the chemical theory of antioxidants and reaction kinetics to a personal context: \"my favorite dish, scaloppine al limone\". However, its submission is fatally flawed as it completely omits the methodology, the content of the variables table, and any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. Without a methodology, it is impossible to assess the appropriateness of the experimental design, which is a core component of Criterion B.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a more convoluted research question (\"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\"), successfully presents all the required components for exploration. It clearly defines its independent variable with a specific range (\"20.0,30.0,40.0,50.0, 60.0 \u00b0C\"), identifies dependent and controlled variables in tables, and provides a detailed, albeit disorganized, step-by-step procedure. Furthermore, Essay B includes a dedicated safety section that identifies a specific chemical hazard, stating \"Acetic acid is very dangerous as it could harm one's eyes,\" demonstrating an attempt to address experimental risks. While it fails to address environmental or ethical considerations, its inclusion of a methodology, variables, and safety makes it a far more complete and successful response to the demands of Criterion B than Essay A.",
