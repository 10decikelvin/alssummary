  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its meticulously planned and viable methodology, which is a core component of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is highly focused and detailed, specifying the exact concentrations to be tested and the method of measurement. The methodology is robust, including a preliminary test to determine the unknown bleach concentration via titration and to find the optimal wavelength for the spectrophotometer. This demonstrates a high level of engagement and scientific forethought. Furthermore, Essay A correctly identifies and justifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, showing a clear understanding of experimental design.\n\nEssay B, while having a solid background section, exhibits fundamental flaws in its experimental design. The research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...?\" is a simple yes/no question, lacking the specificity of Essay A's. More critically, the variables section incorrectly identifies the variables, stating the \"Dependent\" variable is \"Different types of substances dissolved\" and the \"Independent\" variable is \"Temperature change,\" which demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the experimental structure. The author's own evaluation confirms the methodological failure, stating, \"the temperature differences are too small to be considered\" and \"the jump in the temperatures is too small to continue with further calculations.\" While self-reflection is good, the initial planning (Criterion B) was clearly inadequate. Essay A\u2019s plan is sound and leads to a successful investigation, whereas Essay B\u2019s plan is flawed from the outset.",
