  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger across all assessed elements of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\", is a model of excellence; it is focused, precise, and outlines the entire scope of the investigation, including variable ranges and measurement techniques. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is clear but lacks the same level of scientific detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is comprehensive and directly relevant, seamlessly linking reaction mechanisms, the Beer-Lambert law, collision theory, and the Arrhenius equation to justify its methodology. Essay A provides a solid background on freezing point depression, but it is less sophisticated. Methodologically, Essay B is far more rigorous, detailing preliminary testing to refine its procedure and employing precise instruments like a colorimeter and water bath for control. Essay A's method is simpler and has potential control issues, such as ensuring \"identical ice cubes\" and managing ambient temperature.\n\nThe most critical distinction lies in the handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides an exemplary, detailed table outlining specific chemical hazards (e.g., for Propanone: \"Highly flammable, vapour/air mixtures are explosive\") and corresponding mitigation and disposal procedures (\"Do not wash down the sink as it may be hazardous to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\"). Essay A, despite being an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethics, or environmental impact, which is a major flaw. Overall, Essay B demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement, precision, and adherence to IB assessment criteria.",
