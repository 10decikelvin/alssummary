  "reasoning": "Essay A is decisively better as it provides a complete and thorough exploration that meets all the requirements for Criterion B, whereas Essay B has critical omissions. Essay A's research question is exceptionally strong and specific: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". This clearly outlines the independent variable with its range, the dependent variable with units, and the precise analytical method. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is focused but lacks this level of operational detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A presents a comprehensive methodology, a detailed list of controlled variables with justifications, and an exemplary section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. For example, its safety table specifically warns that \"Ammonia buffer is used in the fume cupboard\" because \"Ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive.\" It also explicitly addresses ethical considerations, stating \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved,\" and environmental impact by aiming to \"reduce the tendency of food wastage.\" Essay B, while having a well-written background section, is critically incomplete. It lacks a detailed procedural method, its variables table is empty, and it makes no mention whatsoever of any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw for an experimental investigation. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a far superior understanding and execution of the experimental design process.",
