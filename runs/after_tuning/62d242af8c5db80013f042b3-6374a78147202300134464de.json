  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B.\n\n**1. Research Question and Background:** Essay A presents a highly specific and focused research question: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". This clearly outlines the independent variable (temperature with a specific range), the dependent variable (calcium content), and the precise analytical method. Essay B's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is less detailed; it lacks a specific range for the concentration in the question itself. Furthermore, Essay A's background provides a detailed and relevant explanation of complexometric titrations and the chemistry involved, directly supporting its chosen methodology. While Essay B's background on the redox reaction's feasibility is good, its justification linking concentration to enthalpy change seems to conflate reaction rate with total enthalpy change, a potential conceptual misunderstanding.\n\n**2. Methodology and Variables:** Essay A proposes a sophisticated back-titration method and provides a comprehensive and well-justified list of controlled variables, such as \"Concentration of EDTA solution (0.05moldm\u207b\u00b3)\" and \"The volume of ammonia buffer solution added (10.0cm\u00b3)\". This demonstrates a high level of thought in the experimental design. In contrast, Essay B's methodology is simpler and uses only two data points for its independent variable (\"shifted from 0.5M to 1.0M\"), which is insufficient to establish a meaningful relationship. Its list of controlled variables is also less rigorous; for example, stating pressure is controlled because it's the atmospheric pressure of Kigali is not a meaningful experimental control.\n\n**3. Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** This is where Essay A shows its most significant advantage. It provides specific, justified safety precautions directly linked to the chemicals used, such as stating \"Ammonia buffer is used in the fume cupboard\" because \"ammonia gas will be released... is irritating and corrosive\". It also thoughtfully addresses environmental impact regarding food wastage. Essay B's considerations are far more generic and weaker. Its safety notes mention only \"gloves and laboratory glasses\". Its environmental section describes a questionable procedure: \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain\", which is environmentally unsound for a substance toxic to aquatic life.\n\nOverall, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough, sophisticated, and well-considered approach to experimental design from the research question through to the safety protocols.",
