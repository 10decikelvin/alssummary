  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior level of detail and rigor in its experimental design and documentation, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", is exceptionally strong due to its explicit statement of ranges for two independent variables and the specific measurement technique. Essay B's question is also strong, but Essay A's investigation of two variables is more ambitious. The background information in Essay A is superb; it not only explains the underlying chemical principles but also justifies the choice of the Winkler titration method over alternatives, showing critical thought in the planning stage.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of variables. Essay A presents its controlled variables in a table with columns for \"Why was it controlled?\" and \"How was it controlled?\". The 'how' column provides specific, measurable actions, such as, \"The laboratory thermostat was set to room temperature (25\u00b0C) and a laboratory thermometer (\u00b10.1\u00b0C) was used to ensure this.\" In contrast, Essay B's control for temperature is vague: \"Conducting the experiment in an environment where the temperature is almost the same every time.\" This demonstrates a weaker approach to experimental control.\n\nFinally, Essay A correctly addresses all required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It explicitly states, \"No pertinent ethical considerations for this experiment exist,\" and provides specific chemical disposal methods. Essay B has a strong safety section and addresses environmental concerns but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a flaw. While Essay B's inclusion of a preliminary test to determine the bleach concentration is commendable, Essay A's thoroughness in variable control and its complete S/E/E section make it the better-executed piece of work for this criterion.",
