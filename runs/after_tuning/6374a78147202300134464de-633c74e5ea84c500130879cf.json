  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably better as it presents a more focused and methodologically sound investigation that aligns more closely with the requirements of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its research question: \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\". This question is clear, focused on a single independent variable (concentration), and highly specific, detailing the exact quantities of reactants. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is critically flawed by attempting to investigate two independent variables simultaneously (the type of anion and temperature), which fundamentally weakens the experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A provides a robust background that includes relevant chemical principles, such as calculating cell potential and Gibbs free energy to justify the reaction's spontaneity, demonstrating a deeper engagement with the topic. Essay B's background is much more superficial, offering only basic definitions. While Essay B's methodology is appropriate in principle, its articulation of variables is confusing; it lists \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as independent variables, which is an imprecise and muddled way to frame the investigation. Essay A's variable table is clear, correct, and well-justified. Finally, Essay A addresses all required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, stating \"Environmental issues: I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways...\" and \"Ethical issues: I took no ethical considerations into place...\". Essay B, also an experimental investigation, critically omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant shortcoming.",
