  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for scientific investigations. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is exceptionally well-focused and detailed, specifying the independent variable's range and the exact measurement technique for the dependent variable. Essay B's question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is also strong but slightly less specific. Essay A's methodology is meticulously detailed, particularly in its table of controlled variables which not only lists the variables but also provides clear methods for controlling them and explains why control is necessary (e.g., \"If more HCl is added in one experiment, more iron may be dissolved\"). Furthermore, Essay A's inclusion of a calculation to justify the titrant concentration demonstrates thorough preliminary work. While Essay B also has a good methodology and addresses safety concerns appropriately, its justification for controlling variables is less explicit. Essay A's self-evaluation section is more comprehensive, identifying a wider range of potential systematic and random errors and proposing specific, viable improvements like using a colorimeter. Therefore, due to its more detailed research question, superior control of variables, and more insightful evaluation of the proposed method, Essay A is the stronger example for Criterion B.",
