  "reasoning": "Both submissions present strong investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more comprehensive and well-rounded approach to Criterion B.\n\nEssay B's strength lies in its highly specific research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt) affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measured in ppm in 250.0cm3 of tap water?\", which is exemplary in its detail. Its background information thoroughly explains the complex chemistry of the Winkler titration method, complete with relevant equations. However, Essay B is significantly weakened by its complete omission of any ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw for an experimental investigation.\n\nEssay A, while having a slightly less detailed RQ, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", excels in its overall execution. The methodology is clear, and the student justifies their unconventional approach to measuring the rate. Crucially, Essay A includes a dedicated section for \"Safety & Risk Assessment,\" \"Ethical & Environmental Concerns,\" which is well-considered. For example, it notes, \"...the experiment was designed with waste prevention in mind...Manganese dioxide catalyst remaining...as well as foam produced were collected in a waste bucket and transported to the proper facilities for disposal...\" This demonstrates a complete awareness of the investigation's context.\n\nWhile Essay B's technical background is robust, Essay A's thoughtful inclusion of all required components, especially the detailed safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B. The failure to address two-thirds of the S/E/E aspect in Essay B is a more significant deficiency than any minor lack of specificity in Essay A's research question.",
