  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement and methodological rigor required for this criterion. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally strong, being both focused and highly detailed: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction... in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light, through the use of Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometry (UV-Vis), for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This specificity contrasts sharply with Essay B's overly simple question: \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO3(aq)) change with its concentration?\". Furthermore, Essay A's background information is directly linked to its methodology, explaining complex concepts like the Photo-Fenton reaction and the \"scavenging effect\" to justify its chosen concentration range. Essay B's background is superficial, making a simple analogy to NaCl without providing deep chemical principles.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A employs a sophisticated and appropriate technique (UV-Vis spectrometry) and shows evidence of refinement through detailed \"Preliminary Trials,\" which is a hallmark of excellent exploration. In contrast, Essay B's calorimetric method is fundamentally flawed due to significant, uncontrolled heat loss, a weakness the student even acknowledges: \"there is some systematic error that is caused by the energy that is lost to the surroundings\". Essay A also excels in its identification and justification of controlled variables, presenting them in a clear table. While Essay B identifies variables, its analysis is less thorough. Finally, Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are specific to the chemicals used, stating \"gloves and lab coats were worn when handling H2O2 and MO to prevent chemical burns and exposure to carcinogens\" and that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC\". Essay B's considerations are generic, such as \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\". Although Essay B correctly states there are no ethical issues, this minor point does not compensate for its significant weaknesses in every other aspect of Criterion B.",
