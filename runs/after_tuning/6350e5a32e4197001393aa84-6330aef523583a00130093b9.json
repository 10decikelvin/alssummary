  "reasoning": "The final decision is that Essay A is superior. While both essays present experimental investigations, Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more complete fulfillment of the Criterion B requirements, particularly in its foundational experimental design and consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects.\n\nEssay A's primary strength lies in its well-defined and focused research question: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen... when temperature is kept constant?\". This structure clearly establishes a relationship to be investigated. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"Is it possible to determine the hydration enthalpies for ions...\", is a broad feasibility query rather than a focused investigation, making it inherently weaker. More critically, Essay A correctly identifies its variables, stating the \"Independent Variable\" is \"The concentration of Sodium Chloride (NaCl)salt\" and the \"Dependent Variable\" is the \"Concentration of Dissolved Oxygen\". Essay B fundamentally confuses these concepts, incorrectly listing its \"Independent\" variable as \"Temperature change\" and its \"Dependent\" variable as \"Different types of substances dissolved...\". This represents a significant misunderstanding of experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, both essays are experimental and require full consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental impacts. Essay A excels here, providing separate, detailed sections for each. It offers specific safety advice (\"Sulfuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin.\") and explicit environmental protocols (\"Harmful chemical like acids will be disposed after neutralisation so it minimises the risk to the environment.\"). Essay B provides adequate safety precautions but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a major flaw for an investigation using chemicals like silver nitrate. Although Essay B has a theoretically dense and relevant background section, this strength cannot compensate for the fundamental errors in its experimental design and the omission of key required sections.",
