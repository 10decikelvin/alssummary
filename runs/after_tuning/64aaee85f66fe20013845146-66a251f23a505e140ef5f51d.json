  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The superiority begins with the research question; Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\", is highly specific, focused, and quantitative. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", functions more as a title and lacks the specific, analytical framing of Essay B's. Furthermore, Essay B's background section demonstrates a profound understanding of underlying chemical principles, effectively linking the experiment to \"Gibbs free energy change,\" \"Van't Hoff's equation,\" and \"Le Chatelier's Principle.\" Essay A's background is relevant but far more descriptive and less theoretically grounded.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B presents a more sophisticated and rigorous experimental design, including the creation of a calibration curve and detailed justification for its controlled variables. The table of controlled variables in Essay B provides excellent chemical reasoning for why each variable is controlled. While Essay A's methodology is appropriate for its simpler aim, it lacks this depth. The most significant differentiator, however, is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations where these are mandatory. Essay B provides a comprehensive section addressing all three, with specific chemical hazards identified and disposal methods suggested: \"These chemicals may all pose a risk to aquatic organisms... Before discharge into sewage plants, iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\" Essay A provides adequate safety notes (\"Wear gloves while dealing with dichloromethane\") but entirely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, a critical failure for an experiment using a hazardous chlorinated solvent.",
