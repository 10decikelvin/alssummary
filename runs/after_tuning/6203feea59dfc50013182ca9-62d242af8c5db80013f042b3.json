  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and well-structured investigations. Essay B is superior in its depth of detail, particularly in its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, but is undermined by a critical inconsistency. Essay A presents a more coherent, albeit simpler, experimental plan.\n\nEssay B's research question is highly specific, stating the exact temperatures to be tested: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content...\". Its background information on complexometric titration is thorough, and its justification for choosing this method over others (\"Comparison of Method\") demonstrates strong critical thinking. Furthermore, its handling of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is exemplary. It provides a detailed safety table, explicitly states \"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved\", and thoughtfully considers food waste as an environmental issue. However, the essay contains a significant flaw: the values for the independent variable are inconsistent. The research question lists temperatures up to 100.0\u00b0C, while the variables table lists \"20.0, 35.0, 50.0, 65.0, 80.0\", and the methodology section mentions different values again. This contradiction confuses the entire experimental design.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is also focused and clear. The background information on BOD and the Winkler method is relevant and sufficient. The methodology is appropriate and clearly described. Most importantly, the variables are presented consistently throughout the plan, with the independent variable defined as \"natural pH\", \"acidic pH of 3.0 - 4.0\", and \"alkaline pH of 9.0 \u2013 10.0\". While its safety section is adequate, its environmental consideration is weak (\"disposed off in basin of school laboratory\"), and it completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a notable weakness.\n\nDespite Essay B's superior detail in several sections, Essay A is the better submission. The fundamental coherence of an investigation is paramount. Essay A presents a clear, consistent, and logical plan from research question to methodology. The critical inconsistency in Essay B's independent variable undermines the clarity and reproducibility of its entire experimental design, which is a more significant flaw than Essay A's weaker (but not entirely absent) treatment of safety and environmental issues and its omission of ethics. Therefore, Essay A's consistency makes it a stronger example of scientific exploration.",
