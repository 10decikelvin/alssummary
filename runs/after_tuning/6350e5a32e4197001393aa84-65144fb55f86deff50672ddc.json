  "reasoning": "Both essays represent experimental investigations and successfully address all required components of Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of quality and depth across nearly all elements.\n\nFirst, comparing the research questions, Essay B's is significantly more precise and focused. It states: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\" This RQ is exemplary as it specifies the exact variables, their units, the specific substances being tested, and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is clear but less detailed; it also introduces a secondary, less-controlled variable (\"different water sources\") that broadens the investigation's focus unnecessarily.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay B is more sophisticated and directly linked to complex chemical theory (d-orbital splitting, spectrochemical series, ligand exchange reactions), demonstrating a deeper understanding. Essay A provides relevant and necessary background on dissolved oxygen and the Winkler method, but it is more foundational in nature.\n\nThird, while both methodologies are appropriate, Essay B's design is more controlled. It explicitly lists its assumptions, such as \"ammonia fully displaces the water ligands\" and \"all [complexes obtain] an octahedral geometry,\" which shows strong scientific awareness. Essay A's methodology is sound, but its reliance on field-collected water samples introduces inherent variability that is harder to control than the pure synthesis in Essay B.\n\nFinally, the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are handled adequately in both essays, with specific chemicals and disposal methods mentioned. For example, Essay A notes that \"Sulfuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin,\" and Essay B states that \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life\" and should be disposed of in an \"inorganic waste bin.\" While both are competent, the superior quality of the foundational research question, the depth of the background chemistry, and the higher level of critical thinking in Essay B make it the stronger submission.",
