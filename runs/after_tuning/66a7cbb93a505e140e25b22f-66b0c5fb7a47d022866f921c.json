  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and successfully outline the core components of Criterion B. Essay A presents a clear and focused research question: \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise...?\" The background information on gastric acid and neutralization is relevant, and the methodology is appropriate for a titration. However, its treatment of variables, while acceptable, is less rigorous than Essay B's. For instance, the justification for not controlling the mass of the tablet (\"to give a realistic answer, the mass of each tablet will be kept as is\") is a valid real-world approach but could be more scientifically robust.\n\nEssay B is superior due to its greater depth and scientific rigor. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", investigates a relationship rather than a simple comparison. The background information is more detailed, connecting the chemistry to real-world environmental concerns. The methodology is meticulously planned, including a full serial dilution table. The most significant strength lies in its handling of variables. Essay B provides an exceptional table of controlled variables with clear justifications and methods of control, such as for room temperature: \"The air conditioner will be set to 25\u00b0C... and all windows and doors will be shut\". Furthermore, the justification for the choice of dependent variable measurement unit (kJ/g over kJ/mol) shows sophisticated thinking: \"The uncertainties in the contents of the substances makes kJmol\u207b\u00b9 an unreliable measurement unit to use.\" Finally, its safety considerations are highly specific to the procedure, noting that \"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard to limit air intoxication as much as possible.\" This level of detail and thoughtful justification elevates Essay B above Essay A.",
