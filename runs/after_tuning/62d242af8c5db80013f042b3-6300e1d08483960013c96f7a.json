  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the depth of scientific engagement, methodological rigor, and adherence to IB requirements for safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nFirst, while both essays present clear research questions, Essay A's is more detailed and focused for a chemistry investigation. It specifies the independent variable range and the exact analytical technique: \"How does the temperature... (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". Essay B's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts... affect the volume of melted ice?\", is acceptable but less specific. This difference in detail continues into the background section, where Essay A provides a thorough chemical explanation of complexometric titrations, whereas Essay B offers a more general overview of freezing point depression.\n\nSecond, Essay A's methodology and control of variables are far more comprehensive. The procedure includes precise quantities (\"0.4653g of EDTA powder\") and specific glassware (\"20cm\u00b3 volumetric pipette (\u00b10.03cm\u00b3)\") appropriate for a quantitative chemistry experiment. Its table of controlled variables is extensive, justifying why each of the nine variables must be controlled. In contrast, Essay B's methodology is simplistic and lacks critical details, such as how the melted water is separated from the remaining ice for measurement. Furthermore, its plan to test each sample sequentially (\"Start a 15-minute timer... Repeat steps 11-12 for KCl\") undermines its own control of \"Surrounding temperature and pressure.\"\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay A excels in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, whereas Essay B completely omits them. Essay A provides a specific safety table, warning about ammonia (\"ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive\") and noting the need for a fume cupboard. It explicitly addresses ethics (\"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved\") and environment (\"reduce the tendency of food wastage\"). The complete absence of these sections in Essay B, an experimental investigation, is a major flaw that makes it significantly weaker. Essay A's inclusion of a detailed \"Limitations\" section further showcases a higher level of critical thinking and engagement with the experimental design.",
