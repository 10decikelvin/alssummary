  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much more thorough and well-developed exploration. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its comprehensive background information, which establishes a clear scientific context and personal engagement. For example, it explains the relevant chemistry in detail, stating \"the intermolecular force that exists between molecules, in the case of alcohols, these are hydrogen bonds, van der Waals dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions.\" In contrast, Essay A's background is extremely limited, consisting of a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry...\". Furthermore, Essay B presents two clear, focused research questions and explicitly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables (\"The variables are controlled by including only linear primary alcohols\"). Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased (\"Using Complexometric Titration will determine...\") and it fails to list its controlled variables.\n\nEssay B's data-based methodology is appropriate and complete, identifying specific, reliable databases like \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook\" and outlining data processing steps. Conversely, Essay A's methodology is incomplete, inexplicably starting at step 6, which suggests a significant portion of the procedure is missing. While Essay A does provide a good, specific risk assessment (\"Ammonium chloride buffer should be opened and put into a fume cupboard...\"), which is a required element for an experimental investigation, this strength cannot compensate for the fundamental weaknesses in its background, methodology, and variable identification. As a data-based study, detailed safety protocols are not relevant for Essay B, and its entire premise is built on environmental considerations, making it strong in that regard. Overall, Essay B presents a complete, coherent, and scientifically grounded exploration, whereas Essay A is underdeveloped and incomplete.",
