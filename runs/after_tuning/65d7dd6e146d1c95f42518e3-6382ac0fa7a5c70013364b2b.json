  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions, but Essay B's is more refined, specifying the analytical method for both variables (\"via titrimetric analysis\"). This demonstrates a deeper initial understanding of the experimental process. While both provide some background information, Essay A's is superficial, stating that temperature can affect buffer capacity without explaining the underlying chemical principles. In contrast, Essay B thoroughly explains the effect of heat on the bicarbonate buffer system, providing a relevant and detailed context. Both students identify the key variables correctly. However, Essay B offers a more comprehensive list of controlled variables, including specific parameters like stirring speed and particle size, which are crucial for accuracy. Essay B also provides a much more detailed and replicable methodology, including exact measurements and procedures. Regarding safety, both students acknowledge the use of corrosive acids and the risk of burns from the hot plate. However, Essay B provides more specific and actionable safety precautions, such as using an ice bath for cooling and being careful with heated glass. Therefore, due to its superior research question, detailed background, more controlled methodology, and more thorough safety considerations, Essay B is the stronger submission.",
