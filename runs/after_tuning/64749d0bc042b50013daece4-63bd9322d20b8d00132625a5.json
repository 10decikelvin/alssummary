  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear research questions and methodologies. However, Essay A demonstrates a more comprehensive understanding of experimental design. The research question, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", is exceptionally clear, specifying independent variables, their ranges, and the dependent variable with units. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", is less specific, failing to define \"different masses.\" While both essays address safety, Essay A's table format ('Chemicals', 'Safety hazards', 'Disposal of chemicals', 'Judicial consumption') provides a more structured and thorough risk assessment. Essay B mentions safety concerns like burns and soot inhalation but is less detailed in its mitigation strategies. Furthermore, Essay A's detailed control of variables, such as 'Temperature (when salinity is the independent variable)' and 'Atmospheric pressure', shows a deeper level of scientific rigor. Essay B's discussion on limitations and improvements is good, but its initial planning regarding variable control is less evident. Therefore, due to its superior research question specificity, more thorough risk assessment, and detailed control of variables, Essay A is the stronger submission.",
