  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate strong performance in Criterion B, but Essay A is marginally superior due to its more rigorous and well-structured experimental design, particularly concerning variables.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices...and their vitamin C...concentration measured by redox titration?\", is exemplary. It is highly specific, including the exact levels of the independent variable and the measurement technique. Its background information is relevant, explaining the properties of Vitamin C and the chemistry of redox titration. The methodology is appropriate, and its 'Variables' section is a key strength, presented in a clear table that not only identifies controlled variables but also details the method and reason for control for each one, such as for the \"Concentration of iodine solution\" and \"Volume of analyte\". The safety, ethical (\"minimize the waste of such products\"), and environmental (\"powered off and unplugged when it was not used\") considerations are all present and specific.\n\nEssay B also presents a strong research question: \"How do different active ingredients...in different brands of indigestion tablets...compare in the volume (cm3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\". The background provides relevant context and specific chemical equations for each antacid, which is a significant strength. However, its handling of variables is slightly weaker than Essay A's. While it identifies controlled variables, its justification for not controlling the mass of the tablet\u2014 \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet\"\u2014while having real-world logic, introduces a significant uncontrolled variable from a purely chemical perspective, making a comparison of the active ingredients themselves less direct. Essay A's variable table is more comprehensive and demonstrates a more thoughtful approach to ensuring a fair test. Essay B's S/E/E considerations are also good, with a particularly strong point on environmental disposal (\"hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes\").\n\nUltimately, Essay A's more meticulous and clearly articulated control of variables, showcased in its detailed table, gives it a slight edge. This demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design, which is a core component of Criterion B.",
