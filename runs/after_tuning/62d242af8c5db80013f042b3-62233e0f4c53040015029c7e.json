  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirstly, Essay A's research question is significantly more focused and detailed. It states: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". This RQ is excellent because it specifies the independent variable with its exact values, the dependent variable with its unit, and the precise analytical method to be used. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is vague. It doesn't clearly define what aspect of \"affect the pH\" is being measured, only later clarifying in the introduction that the goal is to determine buffer capacity.\n\nSecondly, the background information in Essay A is more thorough and directly relevant to its complex methodology. It not only explains the biological importance of calcium but also delves into the specific chemistry of complexometric and back titrations with EDTA, justifying the choice of method over alternatives like FAAS. Essay B's background on buffer solutions and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is adequate but less focused, and the explanation lacks the depth seen in Essay A.\n\nThirdly, the methodology and variable control in Essay A are far better articulated. The procedure is logical and easy to follow. The list of controlled variables is extensive and each is justified well, for instance, \"Time taken for the... milk heated... The calcium content in the milk will be leached out as the milk is heated for a longer period.\" Essay B's methodology is confusingly structured, with numbered sections presented out of sequence (e.g., section \u2464 before \u2462 and \u2463). While the variables are identified, the overall plan lacks the clarity and rigour of Essay A.\n\nFinally, and most critically for an experimental investigation, Essay A demonstrates a comprehensive approach to safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It includes a detailed table of specific safety precautions, such as using a fume cupboard for ammonia buffer because \"ammonia gas is irritating and corrosive\". It also explicitly addresses ethical considerations (\"No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved\") and environmental impact (\"reduce the tendency of food wastage\"). Essay B, however, has a minimal safety section that only mentions acetic acid and completely omits ethical and environmental considerations, which is a major flaw.",
