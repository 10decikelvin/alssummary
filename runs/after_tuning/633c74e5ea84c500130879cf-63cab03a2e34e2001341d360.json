  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A for Criterion B. The primary strengths of Essay B lie in its detailed background research, correct identification of variables, and comprehensive safety and environmental considerations. Essay B's background effectively links a real-world issue (water pollution) to the specific investigation, justifying the choice of water sources by citing secondary research: \"The pollution levels were also determined by their distance from the population... Of all the water bodies collected the 'Talhar Village' was the least polluted... While Rawal Lake was most polluted since there is a sewerage outlet in the lake\". It then clearly explains the complex chemistry of the Winkler's method. In contrast, Essay A's background is superficial, providing only a simple definition of solubility.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B correctly identifies its variables (\"Independent Variables: 4 different Water bodies\", \"Dependent Variables: Amount of Dissolved Oxygen\"), whereas Essay A demonstrates significant confusion. Essay A incorrectly lists \"The Temperature of the System\" as an independent variable, when in its described recrystallization method, temperature is the dependent variable being measured to determine solubility. Essay B's methodology is also more rigorous, including a crucial standardization step.\n\nFinally, Essay B's risk assessment is exemplary for an experimental investigation, listing ten specific chemicals and their associated hazards (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer\"). It also explicitly addresses environmental disposal. Essay A's safety section is critically weak and generic (\"The salt used in this experiment can cause irritation\") and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical issues, which is a major failing for a lab-based investigation. While Essay B's research question is awkwardly phrased, the overall quality of its exploration, research, and adherence to scientific protocols is far superior to Essay A.",
