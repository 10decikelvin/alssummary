  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably better as it exhibits a higher level of detail, planning, and scientific rigor across all key elements of Criterion B. While both essays present clear and focused research questions, Essay A's is slightly more specific by defining a numerical range for the independent variable: \"a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C)\". Essay B's research question is also strong, clearly identifying the antacids and their active ingredients. However, the superiority of Essay A becomes evident in its methodology and control of variables. Essay A provides an exemplary table of controlled variables, detailing not just what is controlled (e.g., \"Moisture,\" \"Microbial Contamination,\" \"Light\"), but also precisely how and why each factor must be managed. In contrast, Essay B's list of controlled variables is brief and its justification for not controlling the tablet mass, while plausible, is less rigorous than Essay A's comprehensive approach.\n\nFurthermore, the safety assessment in Essay A is far more thorough and specific to the investigation. It presents a detailed table outlining five distinct risks, such as \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and \"While reflux, there are chances of bursting of flask,\" accompanied by specific precautionary measures. Essay B's safety section is generic, consisting of a single sentence: \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl.\" This lacks the specific risk analysis expected for a hands-on experiment. Finally, Essay A's methodology is more complex, involving solution standardization and reflux, and is supported by a dedicated \"Justification for methodology\" section that explains key choices. While Essay B's methodology is appropriate for its simpler question, Essay A's overall design demonstrates a more sophisticated and meticulously planned scientific exploration.",
