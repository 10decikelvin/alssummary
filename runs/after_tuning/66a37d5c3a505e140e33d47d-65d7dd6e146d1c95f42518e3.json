  "reasoning": "The research questions in both essays are reasonably formulated, though could be more specific. Essay A asks 'to what extent is there a relationship between the temperature ... and the vitamin C concentration', which sets a clear correlational goal. Essay B asks 'How do varying temperatures... affect the buffer capacity', also establishing a relationship to be investigated. However, Essay B's methodology is more robust and detailed. It specifies a wider range of temperatures (15\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C) compared to Essay A's (25\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C, 80\u00b0C), providing more data points for a clearer trend. Furthermore, Essay B details its control variables more comprehensively in a dedicated table, stating 'Concentration of HCl...', 'Amount of indicator added', etc., and explains why they need to be controlled. In contrast, Essay A lists variables but the explanation for why they are controlled is less specific (e.g., 'to control the initial concentration of the solution' without detailing the impact of concentration). Critically, Essay B's safety considerations section explicitly mentions wearing 'lab coat, gloves, and goggles', a crucial detail omitted by Essay A, which only mentions handling chemicals carefully. Therefore, based on the more rigorous experimental design and safety protocols, Essay B is the stronger piece of work.",
