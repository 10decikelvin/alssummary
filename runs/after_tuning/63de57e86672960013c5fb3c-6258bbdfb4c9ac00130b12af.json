  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work that addresses the core components of Criterion B. However, Essay A is superior due to its exceptional clarity, focus, and the elegant design of its investigation.\n\nFirst, evaluating each essay independently:\nEssay A's research question is exemplary: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" It is highly specific, detailing the exact values of the independent variable and specifying a key controlled variable (time) within the question itself. The background information is well-focused, linking a personal interest to the fundamental principles of electrolysis and Faraday's Law. The methodology is appropriate, logical, and directly tests the research question. The variables section is excellent, not only identifying the variables but also thoroughly explaining *why* and *how* they will be controlled. Finally, as an experimental investigation, its safety, ethical, and environmental sections are present and specific; for example, it details the risks of \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084)\" and suggests concrete disposal methods for copper sulphate, such as mixing it with sawdust.\n\nEssay B's research question is also strong and detailed: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures(30\u00b0C,50\u00b0C,100\u00b0C,150\u00b0C,200\u00b0C) by determining Acid value and saponification value...\" The background effectively explains the chemical significance of Acid Value and Saponification Value. The variables section, presented in a clear table, is comprehensive and well-justified. The methodology is highly detailed but also extremely complex, involving multiple standardizations, reflux, and two different titration procedures. The safety considerations are well-structured in a table, identifying risks like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\". The ethical and environmental sections are explicitly addressed, though the environmental advice to dispose of chemicals \"with lab guidelines\" is less specific than Essay A's.\n\nIn comparison, Essay A's superiority lies in its focused and coherent experimental design. The link between its independent variable (voltage) and dependent variable (mass increase) is direct and clearly explained by the background theory. Essay B, while ambitious, is less focused by nature, as it investigates the effect of one independent variable on two separate, complex dependent variables (AV and SV), each requiring its own intricate analytical procedure. This complexity, while demonstrating skill, slightly weakens the overall focus of the exploration compared to Essay A's more streamlined and direct investigation. Therefore, Essay A's combination of an exceptionally clear RQ, focused background, and an elegant, direct methodology makes it the better example of Criterion B.",
