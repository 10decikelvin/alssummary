  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is better. While Essay B presents a clearer and more focused research question, Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific exploration in its methodology and safety considerations, which are critical components of Criterion B for an experimental investigation.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"To what extent do different types of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) affect the volume of melted ice?\", is well-formulated, using evaluative language and clearly defining variables. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water...by comparing secondary data...by using Winkler\u2019s method?\", contains a major contradiction by mentioning \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary data collection experiment.\n\nHowever, beyond the research question, Essay A is far superior. Its methodology is complex, detailed, and appropriate for a chemistry IA, describing a multi-step titration including reagent preparation and standardization. Essay B's method is simple, lacks planned repeats to ensure reliability, and has a potential design flaw in its sequential timing. Most critically, Essay A provides an excellent, specific \"Risk Assessment\" for the numerous hazardous chemicals used, stating for example, \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer...Conduct the experiment in a fume hood.\" It also addresses environmental impact: \"Laboratory standards were followed in discarding of any of the above-mentioned chemicals\". Essay B, despite being an experimental investigation, completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a fundamental failure.\n\nUltimately, Essay A's methodological rigor and thorough engagement with safety protocols demonstrate a much deeper and more comprehensive scientific exploration. The complete absence of safety assessment in Essay B is a critical flaw that cannot be overlooked, making Essay A the stronger submission despite its flawed research question.",
