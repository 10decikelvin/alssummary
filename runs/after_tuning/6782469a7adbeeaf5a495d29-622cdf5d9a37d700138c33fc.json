  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its highly focused research question, rigorous methodology, and more complete consideration of experimental factors. Essay A's research question is exceptionally detailed, specifying not just the reactants and measurement technique, but also the exact wavelength of light and the concentration range being investigated: \"in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light... for concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide between 1.77 mmol dm-3 (3sf) and 0.110 mmol dm-3\". This precision establishes a strong foundation. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction,\" is clear but lacks this level of specificity.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A employs a standard and highly controllable chemical kinetics experiment. The inclusion of a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which justifies changes to concentration and sampling frequency, showcases a thoughtful and scientifically sound approach to developing the procedure. Essay B's experiment, while creative, is inherently fraught with uncontrollable variables. The essay itself acknowledges a major weakness: \"ovens usually have 'hot spots'... the hot spots of the oven most probably still affected the results.\" This fundamental lack of control over a key variable (temperature) undermines the validity of the investigation when compared to Essay A's more precise design.\n\nFinally, while both essays address safety well, Essay A is more comprehensive in its considerations. Essay A explicitly addresses environmental impact, stating that \"chemicals were disposed of in accordance to the guidelines set by IUPAC.\" Essay B, despite being an experimental investigation involving buffer solutions, completely omits any mention of environmental or disposal considerations. Both essays fail to explicitly address ethical considerations, but Essay A's more robust approach to the research question, methodology, and environmental impact makes it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
