  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much stronger foundation in its research question and methodology. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices (orange, lemon, lime) and their vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentration measured by redox titration?\", is exceptionally detailed and focused. It specifies the independent variable's exact conditions, the substances tested, the measurement method, and uses evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear but lacks this level of specificity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is more scientifically rigorous. While both essays present clear, repeatable procedures, Essay A contains a significant conceptual flaw. It states that the gasohol mixtures were prepared using the dilution formula C\u2081V\u2081=C\u2082V\u2082, which is inappropriate for diluting a complex mixture like E10 (gasoline and ethanol) with pure ethanol. Essay B's redox titration is a standard and sound method for its research question. Additionally, Essay A imprecisely identifies its dependent variable as \"The total mass of the fuel burnt,\" when the actual dependent variable is the enthalpy of combustion, which is calculated from this and other measurements. Essay B correctly identifies its dependent variable as the \"Concentration of vitamin C\".\n\nBoth essays excel in their presentation of controlled variables, using clear tables to outline why and how each variable is controlled. However, Essay B's ethical consideration regarding food waste (\"minimize the waste of such products for the experiment\") is more thoughtful than Essay A's simple declaration of \"No ethical considerations\". Conversely, Essay A's environmental consideration regarding chemical waste disposal (\"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company\") is more robust and chemically relevant than Essay B's note on saving energy by unplugging a hot plate. Despite these points, the fundamental strengths of Essay B's research question and the soundness of its methodology make it the better example of Criterion B.",
