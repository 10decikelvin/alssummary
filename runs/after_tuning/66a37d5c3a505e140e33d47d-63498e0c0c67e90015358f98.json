  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong experimental investigations with clear, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A's question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature (25.0\u00b0C, 50.0\u00b0C, 80.0\u00b0C) of various citrus juices...and their vitamin C...concentration measured by redox titration?\", is excellent as it specifies variable ranges and the precise measurement technique. Essay B's question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is similarly strong, defining the specific chemicals and calculation method.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated understanding of the underlying chemistry in its background section, discussing concepts like the \"'salting in effect'\", \"ionic strength\", and charge density (\"Mg\u00b2\u207a ions have a higher charge density (1.99) than Ca\u00b2\u207a ions (0.49)\"). Its methodology is also more complex and thoughtfully designed, including a full calibration experiment and the use of centrifugation \"to prevent sedimentation...as it would hamper spectrophotometer readings.\" Essay A's background on Vitamin C and titration is relevant and sufficient, but less advanced.\n\nThe deciding factor lies in the completeness of the exploration criteria. Both are experimental investigations requiring safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A successfully addresses all three. It details safety precautions like using \"tongs to prevent skin burns,\" addresses ethical issues by stating \"the least possible amount of fruits was used...to minimize the waste,\" and considers environmental impact by noting the heating plate's \"excessive energy consumption.\" In contrast, Essay B only includes a brief safety section (\"Lab coat and gloves were worn\") and completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. This is a critical flaw in an experimental report. While Essay B shows greater chemical depth, Essay A provides a complete and well-rounded response to all requirements of Criterion B, making it the superior submission.",
