  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior to Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...?\", is exceptionally clear, focused, and detailed, precisely defining the independent variable with its range and the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's research question is confusing, stating it will use \"secondary data\" while the methodology describes a primary investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is more robust, including a justification for the titrant concentration and a detailed table of controlled variables with specific methods for their control, such as using a burette to measure the volume of HCl. Essay A's methodology is good, but lacks this level of refinement. The background section of Essay B is also more directly relevant to its investigation, explaining the chemical principles at play. Finally, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. For instance, it provides specific disposal instructions for KMnO4, stating it \"should be disposed into a sealable container,\" whereas Essay A makes a more generic claim that \"Laboratory standards were followed.\"",
