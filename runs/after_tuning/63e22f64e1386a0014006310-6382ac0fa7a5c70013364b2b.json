  "reasoning": "Both essays describe well-structured experimental investigations. Essay A is superior in the formulation of its research question and the depth of its scientific background. Its research question, \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary)...\", is highly specific, defining the exact independent variables and their range. Its background information provides a thorough theoretical foundation for the experiment. In contrast, while Essay B's research question is also clear and focused, its background is more narrative and less scientifically dense. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only listing the variables but also justifying their control and explaining how it was achieved (e.g., \"The same calorimeter was used for every trial.\").\n\nHowever, Essay B is superior in its treatment of the required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a critical component for an experimental investigation. Essay B explicitly addresses environmental impact, stating, \"The excess HCl and sample solution were properly disposed of within the lab itself, since dumping them outside may affect soil pH, thereby disrupting the ecosystem.\" This shows a clear awareness of the investigation's consequences. Essay A, on the other hand, completely omits any discussion of environmental or ethical considerations, despite including them in a section heading. This omission is a significant flaw in an experimental report involving multiple chemical substances. Although Essay A has a stronger scientific setup in its initial sections, Essay B's comprehensive fulfillment of all aspects of Criterion B, particularly the environmental considerations, makes it the better overall submission. The completeness of Essay B's exploration outweighs the slightly more refined scientific question of Essay A.",
