  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations. Essay B is superior because it demonstrates a significantly more sophisticated and in-depth scientific exploration, despite a notable omission.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is far more advanced and focused. It presents a two-part inquiry: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms) in the alcohol homologous series and the enthalpy change of combustion... b) What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol on the enthalpy change of combustion... between isomeric alcohols?\" This specificity, defining the exact carbon chain lengths and the comparison between isomers, shows a high level of scientific thinking. In contrast, Essay A's question is clear but more standard: \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise...?\" While good, it lacks the complexity and targeted detail of Essay B's question.\n\nSecond, Essay B's background information and variable control are more thorough. It provides detailed context on homologous series, alcohol classification, and calorimetry, which directly supports its complex RQ. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, justifying the control of the \"Calorimeter,\" \"Source of water,\" and \"Molar mass of Alcohol Isomers,\" demonstrating a deep understanding of experimental design. Essay A's background is relevant but more general. Its variable list is adequate, but the justification for not controlling tablet mass, while reasoned (\"to give a realistic answer\"), is less rigorous than B's approach.\n\nThe primary weakness of Essay B is its failure to explicitly address environmental and ethical considerations, a clear omission for an experimental IA. Essay A correctly addresses all three areas, stating for environment that \"hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that can damage water pipes\" and for ethics that \"There are no ethical considerations for this experiment.\" However, Essay B's safety section is more specific and robust than Essay A's, identifying risks like \"Spillage of alcohols...highly flammable\" and \"Handling a heated calorimeter.\" Ultimately, the superior quality of Essay B's core scientific exploration\u2014its research question, background, and experimental design\u2014outweighs its procedural flaw. Essay A meets the requirements, but Essay B excels in the quality of the scientific inquiry, which is the heart of Criterion B.",
