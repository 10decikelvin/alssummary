  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent experimental designs, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of rigor, detail, and scientific thinking across all elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is significantly more focused and detailed than Essay A's, as it explicitly states the range and increments of the independent variable. Essay B's background information is highly relevant, providing the necessary theoretical framework, including the equations for Young's Modulus, which directly supports the methodology. In contrast, while Essay A's background on the Winkler method is good, its introduction is less focused on the core chemical principles.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and variables sections. Essay B provides an exceptionally detailed, step-by-step procedure that is easily reproducible and integrates technology like LabQuest 2 and Tracker software to enhance precision. Furthermore, its table of controlled variables is exemplary, detailing not only the variable but also the method of control and the potential impact on results if not controlled, as seen with \"Amount of time on Bunsen Burner\". Essay B even thoughtfully includes a section on uncontrolled variables. Essay A's methodology is adequate but less detailed, and its variables table is much more basic. Finally, while both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, Essay B's treatment is more nuanced, particularly its ethical consideration regarding the use of food materials: \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted.\" This demonstrates a deeper level of critical reflection.",
