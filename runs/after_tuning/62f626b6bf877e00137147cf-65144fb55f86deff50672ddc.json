  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of quality across all elements of Criterion B. The core of the issue lies in the foundational components: the research question and background information. Essay B presents a highly detailed and focused research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This question is exemplary, specifying the exact variables, their units, the substances to be tested, and the precise measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is clear but lacks specificity regarding the range of the independent variable (the expiration dates).\n\nThe disparity in background information is even more pronounced. Essay B provides a thorough, multi-paragraph background explaining d-orbital splitting, ligand exchange reactions, and the function of a spectrophotometer, which is directly relevant to its complex research question. Essay A's background section is critically insufficient, containing only a single sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\". This fails to provide any context for complexometric titration, EDTA, or the chemistry of calcium in milk. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is well-suited to its advanced topic, whereas Essay A's procedure is standard but fails to explicitly identify its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, a significant omission. Finally, Essay B explicitly and thoughtfully addresses safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, noting specific chemical hazards and disposal methods like placing solutions in an \"inorganic waste bin\". Essay A provides a decent risk assessment but offers only a generic environmental note to \"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately\" and completely omits ethical considerations, which is a flaw for an experimental investigation.",
