  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and focused experimental investigations. Essay B demonstrates a high level of theoretical understanding in its background section, deriving the second-order integrated rate law (\"1/c - 1/c\u2080 = kt\") which forms the basis of its methodology. This mathematical rigor is a significant strength. However, Essay A is superior overall because it demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to the entire exploration process, excelling in areas where Essay B is weaker.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" This specificity, including the exact independent variable values and a key controlled variable (time), provides a clearer and more focused framework than Essay B's \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", which is good but less detailed. Furthermore, Essay A's justification for its controlled variables is more comprehensive; for instance, it explains precisely how the \"Distance between the electrodes\" will be managed using a marked wooden splint.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides separate, detailed sections for each. Its environmental section is particularly strong, noting that \"Copper sulphate is a pesticide... and can be harmful to... aquatic life\" and suggesting a specific disposal method: \"Sulphuric acid can be neutralized with sodium carbonate.\" In stark contrast, Essay B's treatment is weak and contradictory. It offers a single disposal instruction (\"ethyl acetate was flushed down the sink with large quantities of water\") and then incorrectly concludes, \"There were no notable ethical or environmental issues associated with this experiment.\" This oversight in an experimental investigation involving multiple chemicals is a critical flaw.\n\nWhile Essay B's theoretical depth is impressive, Essay A presents a more meticulously planned, balanced, and responsible investigation. Its excellence across all aspects of Criterion B\u2014from the highly specific research question and well-justified variables to the exemplary safety and environmental protocols\u2014makes it the better essay.",
