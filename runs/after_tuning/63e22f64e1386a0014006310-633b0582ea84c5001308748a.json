  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it demonstrates a more rigorous and detailed approach to the core components of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, not only asking about the relationship but specifying the exact range of the independent variable: \"What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms)...\" and also proposing a more complex secondary question comparing isomeric alcohols. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", is simpler and less specific. Furthermore, Essay A's identification and justification of controlled variables is far more thorough, listing multiple factors like the calorimeter, volume of water, and stopping temperature, and explaining precisely why and how each will be controlled. Essay B only mentions a single control: \"including only linear primary alcohols.\" While Essay A, being an experimental investigation, omits explicit environmental and ethical considerations (a weakness), its meticulous planning in the methodology, variables, and safety sections showcases a stronger overall exploration design. Essay B's data-based approach is valid, but the planning and detail presented are less comprehensive than in Essay A.",
