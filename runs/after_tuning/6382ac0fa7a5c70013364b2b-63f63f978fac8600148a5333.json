  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is exceptionally well-focused and detailed, specifying the independent variable's range, the dependent variable, and the quantification method. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...?\", is a comparative measurement task rather than an investigation into a relationship between variables. Furthermore, Essay B's background section is vastly superior, providing in-depth, referenced scientific principles including biosorption mechanisms, the effect of pH on equilibrium, and the Beer-Lambert Law, and uses this theory to justify its methodology, such as choosing a pH range below 5.4 to avoid precipitation. Essay A's background is much more personal and narrative-driven, with a weaker scientific rationale, simply stating, \"I noticed from my textbook that we could derive the content of calcium carbonate through the process of thermal decomposition.\"\n\nA critical flaw in Essay A is the incorrect identification of variables; it lists \"Mass of sample before titrating\" as the independent variable, which shows a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design. Essay B, conversely, correctly identifies the independent (\"pH of CuSO\u2084\"), dependent (\"Absorbance of CuSO\u2084 solution\"), and a comprehensive list of controlled variables with clear justifications. The methodology in Essay B is also more rigorous, detailing preliminary trials to justify experimental parameters like adsorption time. Finally, both are experimental investigations where safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are mandatory. Essay B successfully addresses all three, stating, \"No ethical concerns were raised,\" and detailing specific waste disposal: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area.\" Essay A provides good safety and environmental details but completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a clear deficiency.",
