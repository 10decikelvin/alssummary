  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B. Both essays present clear and focused research questions. However, Essay A provides detailed and relevant background information, explaining the chemical principles behind the experiment: \"The amount of vitamin C is determined using redox titration with an iodine solution. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid when exposed to iodine reacts and gets oxidised...\" Essay B lacks any background context, moving directly from the research question to the procedure. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is comprehensive and well-structured, clearly outlining variables such as \"Type and brand of bell pepper\" and \"Temperature Of Water Bath.\" In contrast, Essay B's methodology is incomplete, only showing steps 7-10, and fails to explicitly list the controlled variables. While both essays address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations appropriately for their respective experiments, the fundamental sections of background and methodology are significantly stronger and more complete in Essay A, making it the better scientific report.",
