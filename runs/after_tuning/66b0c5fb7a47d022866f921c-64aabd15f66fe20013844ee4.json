  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundational elements for a Criterion B exploration; however, Essay A is superior due to its comprehensive and appropriate handling of all required components, particularly the risk assessment. Essay B's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands in the market has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid measured in moldm-3 using acid-base titration with a solution of 0.05 moldm-3 Sodium Hydroxide?\". This level of specificity is exemplary. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is also clear and focused, setting up a solid investigation.\n\nBoth essays provide relevant background information and appropriate methodologies. Essay A demonstrates a strong grasp of experimental design, particularly in its justification for the chosen concentrations and its sophisticated identification of the measured dependent variable (\"The total mass of the fuel burnt\") as a proxy for the calculated conceptual variable (enthalpy of combustion). Essay B's methodology is also sound and its controlled variables are well-considered.\n\nThe critical distinction lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. As an experimental investigation involving combustion of flammable liquids, Essay A correctly identifies significant risks and addresses them specifically. It mandates that \"All combustion is to be conducted in a ventilated fume cupboard\" and provides clear instructions for waste disposal: \"All poisonous/harmful mixtures are to be disposed of through a waste collection company.\" It also explicitly states, \"No ethical considerations were considered,\" fulfilling that requirement. Conversely, Essay B, also an experimental investigation, is critically flawed in this area. Its safety section is minimal, making the weak claim that \"No other special safety precautions are required,\" and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. This failure to conduct a proper risk assessment for a lab-based experiment is a significant weakness that undermines the overall quality of its exploration. Therefore, Essay A's thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B makes it the better submission.",
