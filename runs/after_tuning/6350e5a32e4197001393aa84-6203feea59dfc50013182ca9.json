  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its focused and scientifically rigorous experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is exemplary; it is clear, specific, and establishes a single, testable relationship between well-defined variables within a set timeframe using a specified technique. This focus is maintained throughout its relevant background information, logical methodology, and well-defined variables section.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A's foundation is significantly weaker. Its research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is unfocused. It conflates three investigations: the effect of salinity on DO, a comparison across \"different water sources\" (a major uncontrolled variable), and an implicit comparison of the Winkler and probe methods. This lack of focus leads to a confusing methodology that does not clearly explain how the two measurement techniques will be compared on the same samples. While Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental section is more detailed than Essay B's, particularly its mention of neutralizing acid waste, this does not compensate for the fundamental weaknesses in its experimental design. Essay B's design is far more coherent and demonstrates a stronger understanding of scientific investigation.\n\nEssay B's only notable weaknesses are its vague environmental consideration statement, \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory,\" and the lack of an explicit section on ethics. However, these are less critical flaws than the unfocused research question and confusing experimental design presented in Essay A. Ultimately, Essay B presents a much more competent and well-planned scientific exploration.",
