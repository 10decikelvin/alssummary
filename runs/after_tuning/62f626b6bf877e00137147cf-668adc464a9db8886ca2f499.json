  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question is more focused, the background information is more comprehensive and relevant, the methodology is more detailed and justified, the variables are more clearly defined, and the safety and environmental considerations are more specific.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is superior due to its precision: \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\". This clearly outlines the independent variable (with specific concentrations), the dependent variable (reaction rate), and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is less focused and slightly awkwardly phrased.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay B is exceptionally thorough and directly supports the investigation. It includes relevant theory like the \"Beer-lambert law\" and \"Collision theory,\" and even details the preliminary titration used to determine the bleach's initial concentration. Essay A's background is extremely weak, consisting only of a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\". This provides no context for complexometric titration, EDTA, or the chemistry of calcium in milk.\n\nThird, Essay B presents a well-structured and complete methodology, including a crucial \"Pre-Test\" section which demonstrates thoughtful planning. The procedure is detailed and easy to follow. Essay A's methodology is presented as an incomplete list of steps, lacking the same level of detail and justification.\n\nFinally, Essay B excels in its treatment of variables and safety. It explicitly lists independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a table with justifications for their control. Its safety section is presented as a detailed \"Safety Data Sheet\" table with specific hazards and emergency actions. Essay A's variables are only implied by the research question, and its \"Risk assessment\" is less detailed, though still adequate. Furthermore, Essay B's environmental consideration is specific, stating that some chemicals \"were disposed of in a container,\" whereas Essay A's is more generic: \"Dispose of chemical waste appropriately.\"",
