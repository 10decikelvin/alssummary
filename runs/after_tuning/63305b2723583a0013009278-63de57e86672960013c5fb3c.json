  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear and focused research questions. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design and scientific context. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its comprehensive identification and management of controlled variables. It explicitly details how variables like \"The surface area of the electrodes,\" \"Concentration of ions in electrolyte,\" and \"Distance between the electrodes\" will be controlled, which is crucial for the validity of the experiment. In contrast, Essay A's controlled variables section is less detailed, notably omitting key factors like electrode surface area and distance. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is more thorough, including a crucial pre-treatment step: \"Use steel wool to clean the cathode and the anode.\" Finally, Essay B provides a more complete assessment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It specifically addresses ethical concerns, stating, \"There are no ethical issues to be considered,\" and offers more detailed disposal methods for chemicals, such as neutralizing sulfuric acid. Essay A omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a notable weakness.",
