  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the completeness and specificity of the exploration's design. Essay B's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is exceptionally focused, specifying the exact quantities of reactants, which provides a clear and narrow scope for the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B provides a comprehensive and appropriate methodology, including a detailed list of apparatus with uncertainties (\"Digital thermometer ... \u00b10.05\u00b0C\") and a full, step-by-step procedure. Essay A is critically flawed in this area, as it completely omits the methodology section, providing only an incomplete variables table. This omission makes it impossible to assess the appropriateness or viability of its experimental design. Essay B also excels in its background section, demonstrating a higher level of understanding by calculating the cell potential and Gibbs free energy (\"\u0394G\u00b0cell = -212300 kJ\") to justify the reaction's feasibility. While Essay A's background on ascorbic acid oxidation is relevant, it does not show the same theoretical depth.\n\nFinally, Essay B correctly identifies and addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations for its experimental investigation. It explicitly states, \"Environmental issues: I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways as they are hazardous and toxic...\". Essay A, which also describes a lab-based experiment, completely fails to address any of these crucial aspects. The combination of a highly focused research question, a complete and detailed methodology, and thorough risk assessment makes Essay B a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
