  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it presents a complete and high-quality exploration, whereas Essay B is critically incomplete. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying salinity (0%,1%,2%,3,4%,5%) and temperature (15\u00b0C,25\u00b0C,35\u00b0C,45\u00b0C,55\u00b0C,65\u00b0C(\u00b10.1\u00b0C)) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L) in a distilled water sample, measured through Winkler's titration?\", is exceptionally detailed, specifying the exact ranges for both independent variables and the measurement technique. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this crucial specificity. Furthermore, Essay A provides a robust methodology, an exemplary variables table detailing not just *what* was controlled but *why* and *how*, and a thorough safety and disposal plan. For example, for the controlled variable of atmospheric pressure, it explains, \"Dissolved oxygen increases with an increase in atmospheric pressure... All procedures were conducted in the same lab for the duration of the investigation to ensure constant pressure\". Essay B's provided text ends abruptly, completely omitting the methodology, a completed variables section, and any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which are essential for an experimental investigation. While Essay B has a solid background section, the absence of these core components makes it impossible to evaluate its experimental design. Essay A\u2019s safety section is specific, detailing disposal for each chemical, such as for concentrated sulfuric acid: \"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink.\" This comprehensive approach makes Essay A a model of a well-planned investigation.",
