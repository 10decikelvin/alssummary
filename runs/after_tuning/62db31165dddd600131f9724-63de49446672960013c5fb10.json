  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A, primarily because it presents a complete and highly sophisticated investigation, whereas Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is superior due to its specificity (naming the supplement) and use of evaluative language (\"To what extent\"). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail. The background information in Essay B is exemplary, detailing the complex analytical chemistry of UV-Vis spectrometry and the innovative problem-solving required, such as forming a copper(II) complex and using micelles to prevent precipitation. Most importantly, Essay B provides a thorough methodology, a comprehensive list of controlled variables (e.g., \"The model of volumetric flask is kept constant\"), and specific safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, such as \"SDS causes serious eye irritation and mild skin irritation, so gloves must be worn at all times.\" Essay A, however, is fundamentally flawed as it completely lacks a methodology, a detailed variables section (only a header is present), and any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. While Essay A's background on redox titrations is relevant, the absence of the core experimental design components makes it impossible to fully evaluate and renders it significantly weaker than the complete and methodologically advanced work presented in Essay B.",
