  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much deeper and more rigorous approach to scientific exploration. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\", is exemplary in its specificity, clearly defining the variable ranges and concentrations. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad and lacks the focus required for a high-quality investigation. Essay A's background is also far superior, providing a rich theoretical context by linking the investigation to Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and the Beer-Lambert law, whereas Essay B offers only a simple definition of solubility.\n\nThe disparity in quality continues in the methodology and variables sections. Essay A presents a comprehensive table of controlled variables that not only identifies them but also explains *why* and *how* each is controlled, for instance, stating that the \"Volume of Iron (III) nitrate solution\" is controlled because changes \"would\u2019ve changed the position of equilibrium\" and it was controlled using a \"5.00 cm\u00b3 (\u00b10.05 cm\u00b3) graduated pipette.\" Essay B's variables section is fundamentally flawed; it incorrectly identifies \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and provides a minimal and inadequate list of controlled variables (\"Boiling temperature,\" \"Cation group\").\n\nFinally, Essay A excels in its treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. It details specific chemical hazards, such as how potassium thiocyanate \"may decompose and form cyanide gas,\" and outlines specific disposal procedures like neutralization for nitric acid. Essay B's safety section is generic, and it completely omits the required explicit discussion of ethical and environmental considerations, which is a critical failure for an experimental investigation. Overall, Essay A consistently demonstrates excellence across all aspects of Criterion B, while Essay B shows significant weaknesses in its fundamental design and execution.",
