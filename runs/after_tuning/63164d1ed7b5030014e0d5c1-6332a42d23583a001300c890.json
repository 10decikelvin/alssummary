  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a greater depth of chemical understanding and more thorough experimental planning, particularly in its research question, background, and environmental considerations. Essay B's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction... Determination of the activation energy,\" is more focused and scientifically ambitious than Essay A's more descriptive question. The background information in Essay B is substantially more advanced, connecting the experiment to fundamental principles like collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution, and the Arrhenius equation, whereas Essay A's background is limited to defining the titration reaction. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology shows a higher level of preparation by including preliminary calculations for solution molarity and identifying the limiting reactant. While Essay A's safety precautions are slightly more specific regarding actions (\"Use tongs or silicone rubber heat protectors\"), Essay B's overall risk assessment is stronger because it addresses a critical environmental aspect that Essay A overlooks. Essay A dismisses environmental impact with a weak statement: \"No significant environmental concerns.\" In contrast, Essay B correctly identifies a hazardous byproduct and outlines a specific disposal plan, stating, \"Disposal of potassium hydroxide solution... can be hazardous to aquatic life... The solution was carefully disposed of as a hazardous waste.\" This demonstrates a comprehensive and responsible approach to the investigation that elevates it above Essay A.",
