  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a more thorough understanding of experimental design and the underlying chemical principles.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to a candle on its enthalpy of combustion?\", is clear. However, the methodology provided is a list of steps without specific quantities or detailed procedures, making it difficult to replicate. For instance, step 7 simply says \"After 2 minutes, extinguish the candle and record the final temperature of the water\" without specifying the mass of water or the setup of the calorimetry experiment. The safety section is generic, mentioning \"wear... PPE\" without specifying what kind. The environmental consideration is present but lacks detail on proper disposal (\"properly disposed\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is well-defined and focused. The background information clearly explains the concepts of buffers and pKa. The methodology is highly detailed, including specific volumes (\"50.0 cm\u00b3 of an Acetate buffer\"), concentrations (\"1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 CH\u2083COOH\"), and equipment (\"50.0 cm\u00b3 Graduated Cylinder\"), making the experiment easily replicable. The identification of independent, dependent, and controlled variables is explicit and well-organized into tables. The safety section, while brief, correctly identifies the primary hazard (\"Acetic acid is very dangerous as it could harm one's eyes\") from the provided text. Although it lacks a separate environmental section, the overall thoroughness of the planning phase is superior to Essay A's.\n\nTherefore, despite some omissions in the safety/environmental section, Essay B's stronger methodology, clear variable identification, and more detailed background information make it the superior piece of work.",
