  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent investigations. However, Essay B is superior primarily due to its stronger, more focused research question and more thorough methodology. Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is exemplary as it precisely defines the independent variable with its range, the dependent variable, and key controlled parameters. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is less specific as it lacks the concentration range. Essay B's background information provides a clear theoretical foundation with Faraday's Laws, directly justifying its hypothesis. While Essay A's background is good, its hypothesis relies more on a general analogy. Furthermore, Essay B demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design by identifying a more comprehensive list of controlled variables and how they will be managed. Essay A's identification of the dependent variable as \"temperature difference\" instead of the calculated \"specific heat capacity\" is a minor but significant inaccuracy. Finally, while Essay A correctly notes the absence of ethical concerns, Essay B's more detailed safety and environmental considerations slightly outweigh this omission, making it the stronger overall submission for Criterion B.",
