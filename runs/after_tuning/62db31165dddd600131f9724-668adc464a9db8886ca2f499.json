  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A across all key aspects of Criterion B. The most significant difference lies in the formulation of the research question and the subsequent depth of the background and methodology. Essay B's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach (0.2563mol dm-3, 0.1922mol dm-3, 0.1538mol dm-3, 0.1281mol dm-3, 0.1098mol dm-3) reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations of the independent variable and the precise method of measurement for the dependent variable. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks the specificity required for a high-level investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B provides a more comprehensive and relevant background, citing previous studies (\"Henary, M.M., Russell, A.A.J. Chem. Educ., 2007\"), explaining the theoretical underpinnings of its measurement technique (the Beer-Lambert law), and detailing the complex chemistry of bleach's interaction with dyes. While Essay A's background on ascorbic acid oxidation is relevant, it is less thorough. The methodology and variables sections highlight another major gap; Essay B presents a complete, replicable procedure and a detailed table of controlled variables with clear justifications for their importance. Essay A's provided text is incomplete, missing these critical components entirely.\n\nFinally, as both essays describe experimental investigations, the handling of safety and environmental considerations is crucial. Essay B excels by providing a detailed safety table with specific chemical hazards and clear instructions for waste disposal, stating, \"These two chemicals were disposed of in a container which was then taken by the supervisor and disposed of properly.\" Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental issues, which is a critical flaw for a lab-based investigation. Overall, Essay B demonstrates superior planning, deeper research, and a more thorough understanding of experimental design.",
