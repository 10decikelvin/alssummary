  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for scientific investigations, with clear research questions, detailed methodologies, and appropriate identification of variables. However, Essay A is superior due to its more thorough and comprehensive approach across all sections, particularly in its justification and consideration of procedural and safety aspects.\n\n**Research Question & Background:**\nBoth essays have well-focused and detailed research questions. Essay A asks, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II)...\". Essay B asks, \"how different oils with different saturation levels affect the rate of the Maillard Reaction...\". Both are excellent. Essay A's background information is slightly more focused, providing relevant chemical equations and a quantitative justification for the concentration of KMnO\u2084 used: \"Moles of KMnO\u2084 required... = 4.08 x 10\u207b\u2074\", which is a high-level detail. Essay B also provides good background on the Maillard reaction and colorimetry, but Essay A's justification of concentrations adds a layer of precision.\n\n**Methodology & Variables:**\nBoth methodologies are well-structured and detailed. Essay A's inclusion of a \"What was changed\" section demonstrates critical reflection and pilot testing, a sign of a more thorough experimental design process. Essay B's methodology is also strong and well-organized into distinct parts. Both essays provide excellent tables for their controlled variables, explaining not just *how* they will be controlled, but *why* it is important to do so, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the experimental design. For example, Essay B notes for baking time/temperature: \"As the Maillard Reaction is highly dependent on temperature and time, even a slight variation... could change the rate of reaction.\"\n\n**Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:**\nThis is the most significant point of differentiation. Essay A provides a comprehensive section covering all three aspects. It correctly identifies hazards like HCl and broken glass under \"Safety\", discusses waste minimization under \"Ethical,\" and provides specific disposal instructions for chemicals under \"Environmental,\" noting that KMnO\u2084 is \"Toxic to aquatic life.\" In contrast, Essay B only includes a brief \"Risk Assessment\" section covering safety, completely omitting any mention of ethical or environmental considerations. This is a major oversight for a lab-based investigation and is where Essay A clearly excels.\n\nUltimately, while both students demonstrate a strong understanding of experimental design, Essay A is the better piece due to its more complete and thoughtful approach, especially in addressing the safety, ethical, and environmental aspects required by the criteria.",
