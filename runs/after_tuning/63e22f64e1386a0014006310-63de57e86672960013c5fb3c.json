  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it provides a more thorough and detailed exploration that excels in all aspects of Criterion B, particularly in its research question and its safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) considerations. Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" This question is a model of clarity and focus, specifying the precise range for the independent variable and a key controlled variable (time) within the question itself. Furthermore, Essay B meticulously addresses all required S/E/E components for an experimental investigation. It correctly identifies specific chemical hazards, such as \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive and viscous liquid,\" explicitly states, \"There are no ethical issues to be considered,\" and offers detailed, responsible environmental disposal methods, noting that \"Copper sulphate is a pesticide to algae, fungi, and snails.\"\n\nIn contrast, while Essay A presents a competent and well-structured investigation, it has significant shortcomings. Its research question is clear but less detailed than Essay B's. The most critical flaw in Essay A is the complete omission of any ethical or environmental considerations. For a lab-based investigation using a dozen different flammable alcohols, failing to address their proper disposal or environmental impact is a major oversight. Although its safety section is adequate and its methodology for calorimetry is appropriate, the absence of two of the three required S/E/E components prevents it from being considered a high-quality exploration. Therefore, Essay B's comprehensive and detailed approach to all Criterion B elements makes it the clear winner.",
