  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a higher level of scientific inquiry, detail, and theoretical understanding across all aspects of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is exemplary in its specificity: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc, for the reaction between 0.002 mol dm-3 iron(III) nitrate and 0.002 mol dm-3 potassium thiocyanate?\". This is significantly more detailed than Essay A's question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", which is clear but lacks the specific ranges and concentrations within the question itself.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay B is far more comprehensive and theoretically grounded. It expertly links the investigation to multiple advanced chemical concepts, stating it will consider \"Gibbs free energy change, \u0394G,\" \"Van't Hoff's equation,\" and \"Beer-Lambert's law.\" This demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying principles. Essay A provides good, relevant context about biofuels but its theoretical explanation is less rigorous. Furthermore, Essay B's inclusion of a section on \"Preliminary experiments\" shows a proactive and sophisticated approach to experimental design, identifying and solving problems before the main procedure.\n\nThird, while both methodologies are appropriate, Essay B's is more complex (requiring a calibration curve) and its control of variables is more meticulous. For instance, Essay B explains precisely why controlling the concentration of Iron (III) nitrate is critical: \"Changes in the volume and concentration of this reactant would\u2019ve changed the position of equilibrium meaning it would no longer be safe to assume that part A of this reaction produced a known concentration of FeNCS\u00b2\u207a (aq).\" This level of justification exceeds that in Essay A.\n\nFinally, the safety and environmental considerations in Essay B are more specific and thorough. Essay B identifies chemical-specific hazards, such as with potassium thiocyanate where \"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\" and heating \"may decompose and form cyanide gas.\" It also suggests a specific disposal method: \"iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised.\" In contrast, Essay A's considerations are more general, mentioning the need for a \"ventilated fume cupboard to limit air intoxication\" and disposal via a \"waste collection company\" without naming specific toxins or disposal chemistry.",
