  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B.\n\nFirst, Essay B presents a more focused and detailed research question: \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\". This specificity in quantities demonstrates a well-planned investigation from the outset. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent do different types of salts...affect the volume of melted ice?\", is acceptable but less precise. Furthermore, Essay B's background is significantly more sophisticated, incorporating calculations for cell potential and Gibbs free energy (\"$\\Delta G_{\\text {cell }}^{\\theta}=-212300 k J$\") to justify the reaction's feasibility, whereas Essay A's background provides a correct but more superficial explanation of freezing point depression.\n\nSecond, Essay B's methodology is more rigorous and appropriate for a chemistry IA. It uses calorimetry, a standard technique for its research question, and provides a clear, repeatable procedure. Essay A's methodology contains contradictions; it calls for \"four identical ice cubes\" but the procedure outlines using five (one control, four salts), and the sequential timing of each trial (\"Start a 15-minute timer...Repeat steps 11-12 for KCl\") conflicts with its own controlled variable of maintaining the same \"Surrounding temperature and pressure\".\n\nFinally, and most critically, Essay B successfully addresses all safety, ethical, and environmental considerations required for an experimental investigation. It mentions specific safety precautions (\"wore gloves and laboratory glasses\"), explicitly addresses ethics (\"took no ethical considerations into place as the experiment did not have ethical repercussions\"), and details its environmental plan (\"I did not dispose of the chemicals in the local waterways as they are hazardous\"). Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethics, or environmental impact, which is a major flaw for a lab-based investigation. Due to its superior research question, in-depth background, stronger methodology, and complete fulfillment of safety, ethical, and environmental requirements, Essay B is the clear winner.",
