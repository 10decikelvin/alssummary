  "reasoning": "Both essays describe experimental investigations and meet the basic requirements for Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of exploration, depth, and critical engagement.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is more sophisticated than Essay A's, which asks \"To what extent does the vitamin C... content of a bell pepper change with time...\". Essay B's question is evaluative of the methodology itself, indicating a deeper level of scientific inquiry. The background information in Essay B is exceptionally thorough, connecting the topic to global issues like climate change, explaining the underlying chemistry with Le Chatelier's Principle, and critically comparing three different measurement techniques before justifying the choice of the Winkler method. In contrast, Essay A's background is relevant and functional but lacks this impressive depth and context.\n\nMethodologically, both essays are competent. Both correctly identify independent, dependent, and controlled variables. However, Essay B includes a note on learnings from \"preliminary trials,\" which shows a more authentic and rigorous process of experimental design.\n\nFinally, the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is a clear differentiator. Essay B provides a specific, chemical-by-chemical risk assessment (e.g., \"Alkali-iodide-azide \u2013 Very corrosive, can cause serious injury...\") and includes a precise environmental disposal instruction: \"Do not release alkali-iodide-azide or manganese sulphate into the environment, without first diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\". Essay A's safety assessment is more generic (\"Iodine solution should be handled with care\"), and its environmental section simply states \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is less thorough. While Essay A is a good and complete investigation, Essay B is superior in its intellectual framing, depth of research, and attention to procedural detail.",
