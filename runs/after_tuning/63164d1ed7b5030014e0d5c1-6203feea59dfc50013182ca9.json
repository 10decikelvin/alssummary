  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong and well-structured investigations for Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a marginally higher quality of exploration due to its superior detail in variables and safety considerations, as well as a slightly more complex methodology that is clearly justified.\n\nFirst, both research questions are well-formulated. Essay A asks, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", which is appropriately focused. Essay B's question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is also excellent, with the added specificity of naming the analytical method.\n\nIn terms of methodology and variables, both are appropriate. Essay B's presentation, however, is superior. It uses a table to clearly delineate each controlled variable, its purpose, and the method of control (e.g., \"Concentration of H\u2082SO\u2084 | To provide acidic conditions... | Using 6 drops of 80.0% concentrated H\u2082SO\u2084\"). This demonstrates a highly organized and thorough approach. Essay A correctly identifies its variables but lacks this level of organized detail.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both are experimental investigations requiring this section. Essay B provides a far more robust risk assessment, again using a table to link specific chemicals to their precise dangers, such as \"H\u2082SO\u2084... Severe skin burns and respiratory irritations\". In contrast, Essay A's safety section is more general, stating \"Iodine solution should be handled with care.\" Furthermore, Essay B includes a specific environmental action: \"contents of apparatus were carefully cleansed and disposed off in basin of school laboratory\". Essay A merely states, \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is less thorough as it omits any mention of chemical disposal. While Essay B omits a dedicated ethics section, its detailed and specific treatment of safety and environmental protocols makes its overall planning more rigorous and thoughtful than Essay A's.",
