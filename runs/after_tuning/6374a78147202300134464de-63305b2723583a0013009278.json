  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior due to its more refined research question, stronger theoretical background, and more responsible approach to safety and environmental considerations. Essay B's research question, \"How does the voltage (1.5V, 3.0V, 4.5V, 6.0V, 7.5V) affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail after 4 minutes of electroplating?\", is specific and focused by defining the exact range of the independent variable. Essay A's question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks this level of detail. The background information in Essay B is more directly relevant, discussing Faraday's Laws which provides a theoretical basis for the experiment's predictions. The methodology in both is generally good, but the handling of safety and environmental aspects is a key differentiator. Essay B correctly identifies zinc sulphate as toxic and outlines proper disposal as hazardous waste. In contrast, Essay A's environmental consideration is flawed, stating, \"I disposed of the chemical solution of copper (II) sulphate down the drain,\" which is an incorrect and environmentally irresponsible procedure. While both essays identify variables and have replicable procedures, the superior focus, theoretical foundation, and responsible safety/environmental protocols make Essay B the stronger submission.",
