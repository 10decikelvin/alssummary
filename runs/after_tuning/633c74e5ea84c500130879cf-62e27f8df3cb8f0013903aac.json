  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger as it demonstrates a much more thorough and focused approach to the investigation. The research question in Essay B is exemplary: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature (20\u00baC, 30\u00baC, 40\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 60\u00baC) on the initial rate of reaction, as measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter (430-490 \u03bb) .\" This is precise, specifying concentrations, temperatures, and measurement techniques. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is too broad and lacks the necessary parameters for a focused lab investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section is comprehensive, providing relevant chemical theory on kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which directly justify the chosen methodology. Essay A's background is very brief, offering only a simple definition of solubility. The methodology in Essay B is detailed, replicable, and clearly refined through \"Preliminary Testing,\" a hallmark of a well-planned experiment. Essay A's procedure is vague, for example stating, \"Five samples of each salt were taken according to the calculation of the solubility,\" without providing the actual weights or calculations.\n\nFinally, Essay B excels in its identification of variables and its consideration of safety and environmental factors. It provides detailed tables for independent, dependent, and controlled variables with justifications. Its safety section is specific to each chemical used, outlining risks and mitigation, and it explicitly addresses environmental disposal: \"Do not wash down the sink as it may be hazardous to the environment. Dispose according to local legislation.\" Essay A's variable identification is confusing (listing \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable) and its safety precautions are generic, with no mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant omission for an experimental investigation.",
