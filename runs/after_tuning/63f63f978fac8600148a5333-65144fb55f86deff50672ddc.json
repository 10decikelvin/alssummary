  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is better. While both essays present clear, focused, and appropriately detailed research questions, Essay A demonstrates a significantly more robust and well-considered experimental design. Essay A's strength lies in its thorough background research and preliminary trials, which directly informed and refined its methodology. For instance, the student notes, \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated... Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation... To counteract this, I centrifuged all the samples\". This proactive problem-solving ensures the chosen method is appropriate for the entire range of the independent variable, leading to a valid investigation. Furthermore, Essay A's table of variables is comprehensive, with clear justifications for why each controlled variable, such as \"Temperature of System (25\u00b0C)\" and \"Shaking speed (400 rpm)\", must be maintained.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's methodology contains fundamental flaws that undermine the validity of a significant portion of its data, which the student correctly identifies in their evaluation. Essay B's evaluation states, \"a precipitate was observed after ammonium hydroxide was added to [Fe(H2O)6]2+ and [Mn(H2O)6]2+, which... suggests that ammonium hydroxide has not displaced the water and hydroxide ligands\" and that the copper complex \"favors a square planar configuration... instead of the assumed [Cu(NH3)6]2+ structure.\" While this self-evaluation is excellent, it reveals that the initial exploration and design (Criterion B) were not thoroughly researched, making the methodology inappropriate for at least three of the five chosen metal ions. A stronger exploration would have identified these well-known chemical behaviors beforehand and adjusted the choice of ions.\n\nBoth essays handle safety, ethical, and environmental considerations well, with specific details on disposal, such as Essay A's mention of a \"heavy metals disposal area\" and Essay B's use of an \"inorganic waste bin.\" However, the superior methodological soundness and evidence of procedural refinement in Essay A's exploration phase make it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Essay A presents a viable and carefully planned investigation from start to finish, whereas Essay B's plan is fundamentally flawed for much of its scope.",
