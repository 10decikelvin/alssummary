  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it provides a far more thorough and scientifically grounded exploration. Its research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is focused, detailed, and specifies both the variables and the analytical method. This is supported by an excellent background section that explains the relevant chemical principles, such as the \"salting in effect,\" providing a strong theoretical foundation for the investigation. Furthermore, Essay B excels in its experimental design, clearly identifying the independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a detailed table that explains not just *how* they will be controlled but *why* control is necessary.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is significantly weaker in these foundational areas. Its research question is functional but lacks the specificity of Essay B's, and its background section is critically underdeveloped, consisting of only a single generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry to trace out the presence of certain chemicals in a solution\". A major flaw in Essay A is the complete omission of any section defining the independent, dependent, or controlled variables, which is a fundamental requirement for Criterion B. While Essay A does provide a more detailed risk assessment, mentioning specific chemical hazards like \"Ethanol should be kept away from heat as it is very flammable\" and the corrosive nature of EDTA, this strength does not compensate for the profound weaknesses in its scientific context and experimental design. Essay B's methodology is also more sophisticated and detailed, including a necessary calibration experiment. Although Essay B omits explicit environmental and ethical considerations, its overwhelming strength in research focus, scientific background, variable control, and methodological detail makes it the far better example of a well-planned scientific exploration.",
