  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across all key elements of Criterion B. The primary differentiator is the quality and specificity of the research question and the corresponding depth of the background information. Essay B's research question, \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally detailed, specifying the exact variables, their units, the substances under investigation, and the precise measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear but lacks this high degree of focus and specificity.\n\nThis initial strength in Essay B carries through to its background section, which provides a thorough, well-researched explanation of d-orbital splitting, ligand exchange theory, and the spectrochemical series, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of advanced chemistry concepts. Essay A's background is relevant but comparatively superficial, offering a standard textbook definition of specific heat capacity. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is enhanced by a dedicated \"Assumptions\" section, which shows a high level of critical thinking about the experiment's limitations and theoretical underpinnings, a feature entirely absent in Essay A.\n\nBoth investigations are experimental and address safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Both provide specific safety precautions relevant to their procedures. However, Essay B again shows greater depth in its environmental considerations. While Essay A simply states, \"Waste was disposed into the disposal box,\" Essay B explains the reason for the precaution and the mitigation strategy: \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life and is considered a pollutant \u2014 Only use necessary amount of metal sulphates and ammonium hydroxide and use in low concentrations.\" Overall, Essay B presents a much more complex, focused, and well-justified exploration from its conception through to its procedural and safety planning.",
