  "reasoning": "Both essays present competent approaches to a scientific investigation, but Essay B demonstrates a higher quality of exploration overall, particularly in its experimental design and specificity.\n\nFirst, evaluating the research questions, Essay B's is superior. It asks: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm\u00b3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". This question is highly focused and detailed, specifying the independent variable (NaCl concentration), dependent variable (dissolved oxygen), a key controlled variable (temperature), and sample parameters (100cm\u00b3 from different sources). In contrast, Essay A's questions, such as \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\", are clear but lack this level of specificity regarding the scope or conditions of the investigation.\n\nSecond, in terms of methodology and variables, Essay B is more robust. As an experimental investigation, it provides a detailed, step-by-step procedure for both the Winkler titration and the use of a dissolved oxygen probe. The variables are exceptionally well-defined in a table with justifications, for example, \"Controlled Variables: -Volume and Concentration of chemicals used... -Temperature\" with the reason \"Changing of Concentrations and volumes for each sample would make the results unreliable\". Essay A, a data-based study, appropriately outlines its sources (\"ChemPub and Chemeo\") and data processing plan, and correctly identifies its controlled variable (\"including only linear primary alcohols\"). However, the sheer detail and demonstrated planning in Essay B's experimental design is more impressive.\n\nFinally, considering safety, ethical, and environmental (S/E/E) aspects, Essay B fulfills the requirements for an experimental investigation thoroughly. It provides specific safety precautions like \"Sulphuric is very corrosive and should be disposed by being poured down a chemical waste bin,\" and explicitly addresses environmental disposal and ethical concerns. As Essay A is a data-based investigation, the omission of an S/E/E section is appropriate and not a weakness, but Essay B's inclusion of a strong S/E/E section demonstrates a more complete fulfillment of Criterion B for its chosen investigation type. While Essay A has a stronger theoretical background section explaining the chemistry behind the trends, Essay B's superior research question, highly detailed methodology, and comprehensive treatment of variables and safety make it the better essay.",
