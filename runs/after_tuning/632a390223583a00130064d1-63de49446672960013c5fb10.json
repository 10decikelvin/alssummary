  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of IB-level exploration; however, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and methodological sophistication. Essay B's research question, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is highly focused and uses appropriate evaluative language. Its background information is exceptional, providing a detailed chemical foundation for the investigation by explaining UV-Vis spectrometry, Beer-Lambert law, crystal field theory, and the necessity of forming a colored complex for analysis. The standout feature of Essay B is the \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which details a systematic process of identifying problems (insoluble binders, precipitate formation) and scientifically developing solutions (filtration, testing different dyes for micelle formation). This demonstrates a significantly higher level of independent thinking and problem-solving than Essay A.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also well-defined and specific. Its methodology is detailed, incorporating modern technology like LabQuest and Tracker software effectively. Furthermore, its sections on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are more specific and thoughtful than Essay B's, particularly its discussion on the \"Ethical: Use of edible materials\". However, its methodology, while detailed, reads more like an adaptation of an existing procedure (\"partially adapted from University of Georgia (n.d)\"). It lacks the demonstration of independent problem-solving and methodological development that makes Essay B so compelling. The chemical justification for how sodium bicarbonate would affect the polymer structure is also less developed than the justification provided in Essay B for its chosen analytical technique.\n\nUltimately, while Essay A presents a very competent and thorough investigation, Essay B's superior chemical depth and, most importantly, its documented process of methodological development and refinement through pilot studies, showcases a more advanced and authentic scientific exploration.",
