  "decision": "not a pass",
  "reasoning": "The candidate has attempted to establish a research question, stating, 'To what extent does changing the brand of paracetamol affect the amount of caffeine, measured in mg, in pain killers, via an iodine titration method?' However, the methodology is not appropriate for determining the quantity of caffeine. An iodine titration would typically be used to determine the concentration of a reducing agent or an oxidizing agent, neither of which accurately describes caffeine's chemical properties in a way that allows for simple titration. Furthermore, the procedure lacks detail; it mentions using a 'prepared potassium iodate solution' but doesn't specify how it was prepared or standardized. The independent variable is identified as 'the brand of paracetamol', and the dependent variable as the 'volume of thiosulfate solution used', which is a proxy for the amount of caffeine, but the connection is not chemically sound. While safety precautions are mentioned, they are generic and not specific to the chemicals used (e.g., 'wear safety goggles and a lab coat to prevent any contact with corrosive substances'). The procedure does not mention any specific safety risks associated with potassium iodate or sodium thiosulfate. Environmental considerations are also too generic, stating 'the chemicals used in this experiment must be disposed of correctly and not poured down the sink', without specifying the correct disposal method. Given the fundamental flaw in the chemical methodology chosen, the investigation is not viable.",
