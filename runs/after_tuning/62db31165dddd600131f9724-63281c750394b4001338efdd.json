  "reasoning": "While both essays present viable experimental investigations, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and complete approach to Criterion B. Essay A begins with a strong, personally motivated introduction and provides a relevant chemical background on the redox titration method, explaining the reaction: \"C6H8O6(aq) + I2(aq) \u2192 C6H6O6(aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2I\u2212(aq)\". However, its research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", lacks specificity regarding the temperature range. More critically, the provided text for Essay A is incomplete, failing to include a methodology, a completed variables section, or any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which are essential for an experimental investigation.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is comprehensive. Its research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is similarly clear but not exceptionally detailed. However, it excels in all subsequent sections. The background information is focused, citing literature values and providing a strong theoretical justification for its hypothesis, explaining how salt ions form a \"rigid matrix of water molecules.\" Essay B presents a full, step-by-step procedure, a detailed list of apparatus, and a well-defined variables section that correctly identifies independent, dependent, and controlled variables, explaining how each will be managed (e.g., \"Each solution will be heated for exactly 600 seconds.\"). Crucially, it explicitly addresses all safety (\"Wear rubber gloves\"), ethical (\"I did not use any materials from living organisms\"), and environmental (\"Waste was disposed into the disposal box\") aspects. The completeness of Essay B's methodology, variables, and safety considerations makes it a significantly stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
