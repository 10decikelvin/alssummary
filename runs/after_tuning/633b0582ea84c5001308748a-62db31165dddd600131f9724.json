  "reasoning": "The primary distinction between the two essays lies in the completeness of their experimental design and their adherence to the requirements for their chosen investigation type. Essay A outlines a data-based investigation, while Essay B describes a hands-on experimental investigation. Although both essays present clear research questions and strong, relevant background information, Essay A is superior due to its fully articulated methodology and appropriate handling of Criterion B elements.\n\nEssay A's methodology is explicit and well-suited for a database study, stating it will collect data from \"ChemPub and Chemeo\" and use specific databases like \"Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\" and the \"National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Webbook\". Furthermore, it demonstrates foresight in data processing, noting the need for unit conversion and averaging. Its identification of variables is exemplary, not only naming the independent and dependent variables but also specifying a crucial control: \"The variables are controlled by including only linear primary alcohols.\"\n\nConversely, Essay B, while describing a suitable titration method in its background, suffers from incompleteness. Its formal methodology section is missing, and its variables table is empty. The most significant flaw, however, is the complete omission of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. As an experimental investigation involving chemicals (iodine) and heating, this is a critical failure. The IB criteria require these aspects to be addressed for any hands-on experiment.\n\nWhile Essay B's background section provides an excellent chemical foundation for its proposed experiment, particularly the redox reaction for titration, this does not compensate for the procedural gaps and the critical lack of safety protocols. Essay A, being a data-based study, is not required to have experimental safety protocols, and its thoroughness in methodology and variable control makes it a much more complete and well-executed example of Criterion B. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a higher quality of exploration.",
