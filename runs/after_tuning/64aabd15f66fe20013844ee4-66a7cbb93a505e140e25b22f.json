  "reasoning": "Both essays present clear and focused research questions suitable for an IB Chemistry IA. Essay A asks, \"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid,\" specifying the method and titrant. Essay B asks, \"How do different active ingredients... in different brands of indigestion tablets... compare in the volume (cm3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise.\" While both RQs are strong, Essay B's investigation is built on a more robust chemical foundation. Its background section provides specific, balanced chemical equations for each of the three different antacids, demonstrating a deeper engagement with the underlying chemistry compared to Essay A's single general equation for ascorbic acid.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the validity of the chosen methodologies. Essay A's methodology is fundamentally flawed for its stated purpose. The student correctly identifies this flaw in their limitations table, stating, \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid.\" This means an acid-base titration cannot isolate and measure only the ascorbic acid, invalidating the entire experiment's ability to answer the research question. In contrast, Essay B's methodology of titrating a basic tablet with a strong acid is chemically sound and directly addresses its research question without such confounding variables.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B demonstrates superior handling of the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which are mandatory for an experimental investigation. Essay B explicitly details necessary precautions: \"gloves, goggles, and a lab coat should always be worn when handling strong acids like HCl,\" specifies correct disposal (\"All chemicals should be disposed of in a special waste beaker\"), and addresses ethics (\"There are no ethical considerations\"). Essay A, however, is critically deficient in this area. It incorrectly dismisses safety concerns, stating \"Gloves are not necessary,\" and completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant failure for Criterion B. Therefore, due to its valid methodology, stronger chemical background, and complete fulfillment of safety and environmental protocols, Essay B is the superior submission.",
