  "reasoning": "While both essays present viable experimental investigations, Essay B is superior due to its significantly greater depth, complexity, and meticulous attention to detail across all elements of Criterion B. Essay A outlines a classic, competent titration experiment, but Essay B demonstrates a much higher level of scientific inquiry.\n\nThe research questions highlight this difference. Essay A asks a straightforward comparative question: \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise...?\". In contrast, Essay B poses a more sophisticated correlational question: \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat...?\". The term \"relate quantitatively\" indicates a more complex analytical goal.\n\nEssay B's background information is vastly more comprehensive and scientifically rigorous, citing multiple sources and discussing complex concepts like \"calcium-phosphate bonding in casein micelles\" and the role of proteins as Lewis bases. Essay A's background on neutralization is relevant and correct but lacks this depth.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B shows a superior understanding of experimental control. Its table of controlled variables is exhaustive, providing detailed justifications, such as for pH control: \"The Eriochrome black T indicator... gives a colour change... in the pH range of 10-10.5. To keep the pH at constant level... ammonia buffer solution was prepared\". Essay A's controlled variables are appropriate but less thoroughly justified. Furthermore, Essay B's inclusion of a section on *uncontrolled* variables demonstrates a mature awareness of experimental limitations.\n\nFinally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are more specific. For environmental impact, it notes, \"The ammonia buffer solution can be toxic to the aquatic life. Therefore, they were diluted with extensive quantities of water before disposal\". This is more specific than Essay A's more general instruction to dispose of chemicals \"in a special waste beaker\". While Essay A meets the requirements for a good investigation, Essay B consistently operates at a higher level of academic rigor.",
