  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for scientific investigations. Essay A's research question, 'How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk... affect its calcium content... by using... titration?', is highly specific, outlining the independent and dependent variables as well as the precise measurement technique. Essay B's research question is also strong and focused: 'How does the voltage... affect the mass of zinc deposited on a steel nail...?'\n\nBoth provide relevant background information. Essay A explains the chemistry of complexometric titration, while Essay B effectively links its experiment to Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Both methodologies are detailed and appropriate for answering their respective research questions. However, Essay A's control of variables is more thorough, listing numerous factors and explicitly stating how each will be controlled and why. For example, it explains *why* the volume of milk must be controlled: 'The number of calcium ions in the milk will be increased if the amount of sample used increases.' Essay B lists controlled variables but with less detailed justification for each.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the Safety, Ethical, and Environmental considerations. Essay A addresses all three aspects. It correctly notes, 'No ethical precaution is being taken as no organism is involved.' Essay B, while having good safety and environmental points, completely omits any mention of ethical considerations, which is a flaw. Due to its more comprehensive approach to controlling variables and its complete coverage of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects, Essay A is the superior response.",
