  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior as it excels in every assessed element of Criterion B, while Essay A has critical omissions.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question is exceptionally detailed and focused: \"How does an increase in ionic radii (10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m) of central metal ions that are period 4 transition metals (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes calculated through highest absorbance on a spectrophotometer?\". This RQ specifies the exact variables, their units, the substances used, and the measurement technique. In contrast, Essay A's RQ, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear but lacks the specificity of ranges or measurement methods expected at a higher level.\n\nSecond, both essays describe experimental investigations, but only Essay B properly addresses the required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay B provides specific safety points like, \"Metal sulphates can irritate skin and eyes \u2014 safety goggles and lab coats will be worn at all times,\" and addresses environmental impact by stating, \"Ammonium hydroxide is toxic to aquatic life...Only use necessary amount...and use in low concentrations.\" Essay A completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental factors, which is a major flaw for a lab-based investigation.\n\nFinally, Essay B provides a comprehensive background on d-orbital splitting and a well-defined methodology. Its evaluation section further demonstrates a strong grasp of variables and potential errors. Conversely, Essay A fails to define its variables; the provided table under the \"Variables\" heading is completely empty. This omission makes it impossible to fully assess the experimental design. Therefore, Essay B's thoroughness in its research question, methodology, and inclusion of all required safety and environmental considerations makes it the far better example of Criterion B.",
