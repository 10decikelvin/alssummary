  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all elements of Criterion B. The primary difference lies in the quality of the research question and the depth of the background information that supports it. Essay B presents a focused, specific, and evaluative research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\". This is far superior to Essay A's broad, descriptive question: \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\". Essay B's background section is exemplary; it establishes a real-world context (global warming), explains the underlying chemistry (Le Chatelier's Principle), and thoroughly reviews alternative measurement techniques before logically arriving at its focused research question. In contrast, Essay A's background is brief and its hypothesis justification is weak.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B demonstrates a much clearer understanding of experimental design. Its identification of variables is precise and correct: \"The dependant variable...is the DO concentration...The independent variable is the temperature...The control factors include pressure, salinity...\". Essay A's variable section is confused, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as independent variables, which muddles the experimental design. Both essays describe experimental investigations, making safety, ethical, and environmental considerations mandatory. Essay B excels here, providing a specific risk assessment for named chemicals (\"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive\"), and explicitly addressing both ethical (\"There are no major ethical issues\") and environmental concerns, including a specific disposal instruction (\"diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\"). Essay A's safety section is generic (\"The salt used in this experiment can cause irritation\"), and it completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental considerations, which is a critical flaw.",
