  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all key aspects of Criterion B. The core strength of Essay A lies in its sophisticated and well-justified research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\". This question is not only clear and focused but also evaluative (\"To what extent\"), setting up a high-level investigation. The background research directly supports this question by providing real-world context (global warming), explaining the underlying chemistry (Le Chatelier's Principle), and, most importantly, comparing multiple methods for measuring dissolved oxygen, thus providing a strong rationale for investigating the Winkler method specifically.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6 grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear but lacks the same level of detail and evaluative depth. While Essay B's background is strong in its use of electrochemical data to prove reaction feasibility (calculating E\u00b0cell and \u0394G\u00b0cell), its experimental design is critically flawed. The methodology only plans to test two concentrations, \"0.5M and 1.0M,\" which is insufficient to meaningfully investigate how concentration affects enthalpy change. Essay A's methodology is far more robust, planning for a range of temperatures and including details from preliminary trials, such as \"when collecting the sample of water from the tap, the water stream should be slow and constant as not to aerate the water\".\n\nFinally, Essay A's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors is more thorough. Its risk assessment is specific to each chemical (\"Concentrated sulfuric acid \u2013 Corrosive, wear goggles, lab coat and gloves\"), and its environmental disposal plan is precise (\"diluting with tap water in a minimum ratio of 1:2\"). Essay B addresses these points, but with less detail. Overall, Essay A presents a well-conceived, thoroughly researched, and meticulously planned investigation, making it the better essay.",
