  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "While both submissions demonstrate a good understanding of experimental design, Essay A is superior due to its more thorough and structured approach. The research question in Essay A is more specific, including the sample size (\"100cm3\") and controlled variable (\"when temperature is kept constant\"), compared to Essay B's more general question. Essay A provides extensive background information on both dissolved oxygen and the titration method, which is completely missing from the provided excerpt for Essay B. Furthermore, Essay A clearly delineates its independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a table with justifications, a critical component that is absent in the submission for Essay B. Both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns. However, the comprehensive and well-structured nature of Essay A's experimental plan makes it a stronger example of scientific methodology.",
