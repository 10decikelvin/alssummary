  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The provided text, ostensibly for an experimental investigation, demonstrates a significant lack of clarity and scientific coherence, making it the weaker submission. \n\n**Clarity and Focus:** The research question, 'Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands in the market has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid...?', is fundamentally disconnected from the procedure, which aims to measure the effect of temperature on the buffer capacity of a facial cleanser. The independent variable is listed as 'Temperature', while the dependent variable is 'buffer capacity', neither of which directly answers the stated research question about concentration comparison between brands. \n\n**Methodological Flaws:** The procedure described is chemically flawed. It suggests titrating an acid (ascorbic acid in orange juice) with another acid (HCl). This acid-acid titration is nonsensical for determining concentration. A base, such as the mentioned NaOH, should be the titrant. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the chemical principles involved. \n\n**Inconsistencies:** There are numerous inconsistencies throughout the text. The title mentions 'orange juice', but the methodology repeatedly refers to preparing and testing a 'facial cleanser solution'. This makes it impossible to understand what was actually investigated.\n\n**Positive Aspects (Limited):** The student does correctly identify the need for controlled variables and provides a basic safety assessment. They also list relevant formulas, although their application in the context of the described procedure is questionable. The mention of using a pH probe for measurement is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Due to the fundamental contradictions between the research question, methodology, and the described experimental procedure, this submission is deeply flawed. It lacks a clear, focused, and workable plan. Assuming the missing 'Essay B' presents a coherent and logical experiment, 'Essay A' is substantially weaker.",
