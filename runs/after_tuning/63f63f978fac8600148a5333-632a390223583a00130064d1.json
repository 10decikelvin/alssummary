  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed investigations. Essay A is superior due to its stronger scientific context and more thorough methodological development.\n\n**Evaluation of Essays:**\n\n*   **Research Question:** Both essays feature clear, focused, and detailed research questions. Essay A's RQ, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is excellent because it specifies the variable, its range, the material used, and the precise method of quantification. Essay B's RQ, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is also strong, clearly defining its variables and their ranges.\n*   **Background Information:** Essay A provides a much stronger and more relevant background. It thoroughly explains the chemical principles underpinning the investigation, stating, \"At lower pH values...the position of equilibrium is shifted to the right...favouring the formation of carboxylic acid. These groups are less prone to bonding with the Cu\u00b2\u207a ions\". This demonstrates a deep understanding of the chemical mechanism. In contrast, while Essay B defines bioplastics and Young's Modulus, it fails to provide any chemical rationale for how its independent variable, Sodium Bicarbonate, would affect the plastic's properties. This is a significant omission.\n*   **Methodology & Variables:** Both essays outline appropriate and detailed methodologies. Both feature excellent tables of controlled variables that not only identify them but also justify their control, for example, Essay B notes for the amount of cornstarch: \"Having different amounts of cornstarch would mean that different samples have more or less to polymerize\". Essay A, however, includes a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which demonstrates a more refined experimental design process by explaining how the pH range and adsorption time were optimized.\n*   **Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays are experimental and address these considerations well. Essay A correctly notes the need for specific disposal: \"All CuSO\u2084 solutions were disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\". Essay B offers a particularly thoughtful ethical consideration: \"Utilising edible materials for an experiment means that, ultimately, food and water are being wasted...We must be conscious of the materials used\". Both are commendable in this area.\n\n**Comparison and Decision:**\nEssay A is the stronger submission. Its primary advantage lies in the depth of its background section, which provides a clear and detailed chemical mechanism linking the independent and dependent variables. This scientific grounding is somewhat lacking in Essay B. Furthermore, Essay A's inclusion of preliminary trials demonstrates a superior level of engagement with the practical aspects of the experimental design. While Essay B is very strong procedurally, Essay A's combination of robust scientific context and refined methodology makes it the better example of Criterion B.",
