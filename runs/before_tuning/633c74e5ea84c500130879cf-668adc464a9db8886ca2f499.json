  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A for Criterion B. Its superiority is evident across all aspects of the exploration, from the research question to the safety considerations.\n\nThe research question of Essay B, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is focused, specific, and clearly defines a single independent variable (bleach concentration) and a measurable dependent variable (reaction rate). In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is fundamentally flawed because it attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously (anion type and temperature), which makes for a poorly designed and unfocused investigation.\n\nEssay B's background section is comprehensive, demonstrating significant personal engagement and a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry. It successfully connects a real-world problem (stains) to complex chemical principles like kinetics, redox reactions, collision theory, and the Beer-Lambert law. It also impressively details the preliminary titration required to determine the initial bleach concentration, showing a high level of procedural thought. Essay A's background is superficial; it provides a basic definition of solubility but fails to delve into the thermodynamics (e.g., lattice and hydration enthalpies) that would properly explain why anions and temperature affect solubility.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's identification and justification of variables are exemplary. The independent, dependent, and controlled variables are clearly laid out in a table, with explanations for why each must be controlled and how this will be achieved. Essay A's variable section is confused; it incorrectly identifies \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and struggles to distinguish between the measured variable (crystallization point) and the calculated dependent variable (solubility).\n\nFinally, the methodology and safety sections of Essay B are far more rigorous. Essay B details a necessary pre-test to determine the optimal wavelength for the spectrophotometer and the concentration of the commercial bleach, which is a hallmark of a well-planned experiment. Its safety table is specific to the chemicals used, addresses disposal and environmental concerns properly, and is far more thorough than Essay A's generic safety note.",
