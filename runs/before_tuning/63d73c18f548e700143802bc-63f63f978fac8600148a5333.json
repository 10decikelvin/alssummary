  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of proficiency in meeting the requirements for Criterion B. Essay A presents a classic and well-structured investigation into buffer capacity, with a clear research question, thorough background information grounded in fundamental chemical principles like the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and a well-defined methodology. However, Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated and personally engaged exploration. Its rationale is exceptionally well-developed, linking a global environmental issue to a novel solution and justifying the specific acidic pH range by citing literature and chemical limitations like the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082. The inclusion of a \"Preliminary Trials\" section is a significant strength, as it showcases an authentic scientific process of problem-solving and methodological refinement, which is a hallmark of excellent independent work. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of controlled variables is more detailed and nuanced, considering factors like the \"Brand of Oranges\" and \"Shaking speed\" with clear justifications for their impact. While Essay A is methodologically sound and precise, Essay B's combination of a more complex topic, deeper preliminary research, and clear evidence of methodological adaptation makes it a stronger example of scientific exploration.",
