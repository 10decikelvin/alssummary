  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and scientifically rigorous exploration. Its research question is highly focused, specifying the exact temperatures and metrics for measurement, whereas Essay A's question is broad, attempting to compare three substances with two different methods simultaneously. The background information in Essay B is exemplary, linking the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction to real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia and grounding the investigation in fundamental chemical principles like collision theory and redox reactions, complete with diagrams. In contrast, Essay A's background is more of a personal narrative and provides only basic chemical equations without in-depth theoretical context.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is far superior. The student thoughtfully documents their process of selecting the best measurement tool (rejecting visual observation and a colorimeter in favor of a lux sensor), demonstrating authentic inquiry and preliminary work. Essay A's methodology contains a significant flaw: using a measuring cylinder instead of a pipette for taking an aliquot for titration, which undermines the precision of the entire procedure. Furthermore, Essay B correctly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, whereas Essay A misidentifies the independent variable as the \"Mass of sample,\" a fundamental misunderstanding. Finally, while both essays address safety, Essay B's approach is more detailed, citing specific chemical hazards and proactively reducing the scale of the experiment to minimize environmental impact, showcasing a higher level of consideration.",
