  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of proficiency in meeting the requirements for Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-focused and specific, clearly outlining the independent variable (five precise concentrations of bleach), the dependent variable (reaction rate), and the method of measurement (spectrophotometry). The background information is thorough, relevant, and directly linked to the experimental design, including a sophisticated discussion of the Beer-Lambert law, reaction kinetics, and the underlying chemistry of bleach and dyes. The inclusion of a preliminary titration to determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach is a hallmark of excellent personal engagement and meticulous planning. Furthermore, the methodology is logically structured, repeatable, and the control variables are thoughtfully identified with clear justifications.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's research question is vague (\"How does the change in temperature... affect the pH...\"). While the text later clarifies that buffer capacity is the intended focus, the initial question lacks precision. The background information is adequate but less detailed than in Essay A. The methodology section of Essay B is its most significant weakness; it is poorly organized with non-sequential numbering (e.g., section \u2464 appears before \u2462), making it very difficult to follow. The procedure for preparing the buffer solution is convoluted and confusingly explained. The safety section is incomplete, failing to address key risks and mitigation strategies adequately. While the topic is suitable, the overall execution of the planning and methodology in Essay B is far weaker than in Essay A.\n\nUltimately, Essay A presents a complete, well-reasoned, and scientifically rigorous exploration. Essay B, while based on a valid concept, suffers from a lack of clarity, poor organization, and insufficient detail in its methodology and safety considerations.",
