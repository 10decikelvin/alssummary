  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay A demonstrates a higher level of personal engagement, scientific thinking, and methodological development. Essay A's research question is well-focused, and its introduction effectively links a broad, real-world interest (vitamin stability in food) to a manageable and specific lab investigation. The background information is excellent, not only explaining the necessary chemistry of Vitamin B6 but also delving into advanced concepts like Crystal Field Theory to justify the use of a copper(II) complex for UV-Vis analysis. The standout feature of Essay A is its detailed \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which clearly documents the student's problem-solving process. They identified issues with tablet binders and precipitate formation, researched solutions like micelle formation (citing a source), and adapted their procedure when the ideal chemical was unavailable. This iterative refinement is a hallmark of excellent scientific exploration.\n\nEssay B is also very strong. Its research question is clear, and the background information on bioplastics and Young's Modulus is thorough. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, and the identification of controlled and uncontrolled variables is excellent, showing a high degree of foresight and critical thinking about the experiment's limitations. The consideration of ethical issues regarding the use of food materials is particularly commendable. However, Essay B's primary weakness in comparison to Essay A is the apparent lack of a similar developmental process. The method is described as \"partially adapted,\" and while it is executed with great detail, there is less evidence of the student personally encountering and overcoming unforeseen challenges in the design phase. Essay A\u2019s journey of troubleshooting and adapting its method based on preliminary work gives it the edge in demonstrating a more authentic and sophisticated investigative process.",
