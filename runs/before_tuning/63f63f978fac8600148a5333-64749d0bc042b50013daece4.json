  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially stronger than Essay B, primarily due to its focused research question, sophisticated methodology, and deeper engagement with the underlying chemistry. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying pH... affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels,\" is clear, focused, and manageable for an IA. In contrast, Essay B's research question attempts to investigate two independent variables (salinity and temperature), which is a fundamental flaw in experimental design for this level.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A demonstrates superior methodological rigor and personal input. The inclusion of preliminary trials to determine optimal contact time and pH range is a significant strength, showing thoughtful planning. The student in Essay A also identifies a key problem\u2014the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082\u2014and devises a clever solution by centrifuging the samples, which shows a high level of critical thinking. Essay B's methodology is a standard Winkler titration protocol that feels more like a \"cookbook\" procedure with less evidence of personal problem-solving.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is more detailed and directly relevant, explaining the specific chemical mechanisms of biosorption (chelation, ion exchange) and justifying the chosen pH range with respect to the Ksp of copper (II) hydroxide. While Essay B's background is adequate, it is more general. Finally, Essay A's environmental considerations are more specific and appropriate (\"disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\") compared to Essay B's more generic disposal instructions.",
