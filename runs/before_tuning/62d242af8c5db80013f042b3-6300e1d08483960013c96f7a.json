  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the requirements for Criterion B. Its research question is focused and incorporates a specific, relevant analytical technique (EDTA complexometric titration). The background information is detailed, scientifically sound, and directly supports the chosen methodology by explaining the principles of complexometric back titration with relevant chemical equations. The methodology itself is thorough, well-structured, and includes an excellent \"Comparison of Method\" section justifying the choice of titration over other techniques. Most notably, Essay A excels in its identification and control of variables, its comprehensive discussion of safety and environmental precautions, and its insightful analysis of the experiment's limitations, complete with specific, practical suggestions for improvement.\n\nEssay B, while based on a sound scientific principle (freezing point depression), presents a significantly weaker experimental design. The background information is adequate but less detailed than in Essay A. The methodology has several critical flaws: it fails to specify how \"identical ice cubes\" will be ensured, the use of a vacuum flask is counterintuitive for a melting experiment without further justification, it doesn't describe how to separate the melted water from the remaining ice and salt, and it lacks any mention of repeated trials. Furthermore, the complete omission of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is a major weakness. While the student correctly identifies in the \"Extensions\" that controlling for moles of salt would be better than mass, this highlights a fundamental flaw in their primary experimental design rather than a reflection on its limitations.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a sophisticated, well-planned, and critically evaluated investigation, fulfilling all aspects of Criterion B to a high standard. Essay B's plan is simplistic and contains significant methodological oversights and omissions.",
