  "reasoning": "While both submissions show a solid understanding of experimental design, Essay A is superior due to its more focused research question, rigorous control of variables, and a more insightful evaluation of its methodology.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl... affect the solubility of iron(II)...,\" establishes a clear, quantifiable, and controllable independent variable (pH) and a measurable dependent variable (mass of iron(II) extracted). This allows for a more robust scientific investigation. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level...,\" uses \"pollution level\" as the independent variable, which is qualitative and not directly controlled, making it difficult to establish a clear causal link.\n\nThe methodology section of Essay A is exceptionally strong. The table of controlled variables is detailed, not only identifying the variables but also explaining precisely *how* they will be controlled and *why* it is important. This demonstrates a deep understanding of experimental design. For example, controlling the \"Time given for iron tablet to dissolve\" is justified by explaining its effect on the concentration of FeCl\u2082. Essay B lists its controlled variables but lacks this critical justification and methodology for control.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's \"Weaknesses\" section is a model of self-reflection and critical evaluation. It correctly identifies potential random and systematic errors, explains their likely impact on the results (e.g., \"causing the mass of iron extracted calculated to be lower than actual\"), and suggests specific, viable improvements like using a colorimeter. Essay B's \"Limitations\" section is less developed; for instance, for the problem of \"Spillage,\" the solution is listed as \"N/A,\" which is a missed opportunity for evaluation.\n\nFinally, Essay A's background information includes a justification for the concentration of KMnO\u2084 used, supported by stoichiometric calculations, which showcases excellent preliminary planning. Essay B's background is good, but the link between the broader context of water pollution and the specific choice of water bodies is based on observation rather than quantifiable preliminary data.\n\nIn summary, Essay A presents a more scientifically rigorous, well-controlled, and critically evaluated experimental plan, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
