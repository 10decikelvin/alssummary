  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific exploration and rigor compared to Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6,\" is focused and sets up a quantitative investigation. Its background section is exceptionally detailed, not only explaining the biological context but also providing sophisticated chemical principles like the Beer-Lambert law and crystal field theory to justify the chosen methodology. The standout feature of Essay A is the \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which showcases a proactive and iterative approach to experimental design; the student identifies multiple complex problems (impurities, precipitation of the analyte) and systematically researches and tests solutions (filtration, micelle formation), which is the hallmark of an excellent investigation. Furthermore, the control of variables in Essay A is meticulous, considering subtle factors like using the same cuvette and cooling samples to a consistent temperature before measurement.\n\nEssay B presents a competent investigation with a clear research question and good evidence of personal engagement through the choice of culturally relevant samples. However, its methodology contains a fundamental and foreseeable flaw: using a Bunsen burner for thermal decomposition, a process that requires much higher and more stable temperatures than a burner can provide. While the student commendably identifies this limitation in their evaluation, a stronger exploration would have anticipated this issue during the planning phase. Additionally, the control of variables in Essay B is weaker; for instance, stating that temperature is controlled by using the \"same Bunsen Burner\" is scientifically inadequate. The background in Essay B is also comparatively superficial, providing only the basic reaction equations without the theoretical depth seen in Essay A.\n\nIn summary, while Essay B is a solid effort, Essay A is exemplary in its depth of research, sophisticated problem-solving, and rigorous experimental design, making it the clear winner for Criterion B.",
