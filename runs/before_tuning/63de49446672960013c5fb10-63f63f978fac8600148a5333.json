  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, making this a close comparison. Essay B is excellent, with a well-defined research question rooted in a strong environmental context. Its background information clearly explains the mechanism of biosorption, and its table of controlled variables is exceptionally detailed and well-justified, showing a deep understanding of factors that could influence the outcome. The inclusion of preliminary trials to determine the optimal pH range and contact time demonstrates strong personal engagement and methodical planning.\n\nHowever, Essay A is marginally superior due to the complexity of the chemical theory it engages with and the sophisticated, multi-layered problem-solving demonstrated in its methodological development. The student not only identified that the analyte (Vitamin B6) was colorless and needed to be complexed with Cu(II) for UV-Vis analysis but also encountered a secondary problem of the complex precipitating. The subsequent research and implementation of micelle formation using SDS and a substitute dye (Crystal Violet, chosen after a pilot study) represents a more advanced and innovative approach to experimental design. This journey showcases a slightly deeper level of scientific exploration and personal input, moving from a simple research idea to a complex and nuanced analytical procedure. The background section's inclusion of Crystal Field Theory to explain the color of transition metal complexes further highlights the student's exceptional theoretical understanding. While Essay B's methodology is robust, Essay A's demonstrates a greater degree of scientific creativity and a more profound engagement with advanced chemical principles to overcome experimental hurdles.",
