  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of Criterion B, where Essay A demonstrates a significantly more rigorous and scientifically sound experimental design. Essay A's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate?\", is well-supported by a thorough background in chemical kinetics, including collision theory and the Arrhenius equation. Its methodology is robust, outlining five temperature points with five repetitions each, and employing a water bath for precise temperature control, which is crucial for a kinetics study. In contrast, while Essay B presents a personally engaging research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days...?\", its methodology is fundamentally flawed. The procedure of altering pH with strong acid (HCl) and strong base (NaOH) to extreme values (pH 3-4 and 9-10) would likely kill the microorganisms responsible for oxygen consumption, thereby invalidating any measurement of *biological* oxygen demand.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its consideration of variables and safety. It lists specific controlled variables and explains why they must be controlled, and its safety table includes appropriate disposal methods for hazardous waste, stating \"The solution was carefully disposed of as a hazardous waste after the end of the experiment, following the laboratory regulations.\" Essay B's control of variables is weaker, particularly the inadequate method for controlling temperature (\"Storing water samples in a cool dark cupboard\") for a 5-day biological incubation. Additionally, its environmental consideration is insufficient, simply stating that waste was disposed of \"in basin of school laboratory,\" which is inappropriate for the chemicals used. Although Essay B shows strong personal engagement, Essay A's superior experimental design, scientific validity, and attention to detail make it the better example of Criterion B.",
