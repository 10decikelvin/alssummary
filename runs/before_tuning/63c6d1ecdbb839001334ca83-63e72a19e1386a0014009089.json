  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed explorations of their chosen research questions. Essay B provides a very thorough theoretical background, explaining concepts like dipole-induced-dipole interactions and hydration with clarity. Its methodology is also comprehensive, detailing the preparation of all necessary solutions. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly superior level of personal engagement and critical thinking throughout the design process. For example, it justifies the chosen range of the independent variable by relating it to preliminary trials and real-world scenarios (pH of drinks). More impressively, it includes a section on procedural modifications based on these trials, which shows an iterative and thoughtful approach to experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A's 'Safety, ethical and environmental' section is more specific and well-referenced compared to the more generic table in Essay B. The evaluation sections in both are strong, but Essay A's detailed justification for the titrant concentration gives it a slight edge in demonstrating foresight and thorough planning. Therefore, despite the excellent quality of both, Essay A is marginally better due to its deeper evidence of personal engagement and meticulous experimental design.",
