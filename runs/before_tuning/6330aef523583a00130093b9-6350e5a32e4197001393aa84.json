  "reasoning": "The decision is made by comparing the core components of IB Criterion B: Exploration, including the research question, background, methodology, variables, and safety considerations. Essay B is demonstrably superior across most of these components.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen... when temperature is kept constant?\", is exceptionally well-formulated, clearly outlining the independent, dependent, and a key controlled variable. In contrast, while Essay A's question is focused, its methodology proved to be flawed in its initial design, as acknowledged in its own evaluation: \"the temperature differences are too small to be considered.\" This indicates a weakness in the planning and exploration phase.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the handling of variables. Essay B correctly identifies the independent (NaCl concentration), dependent (Dissolved Oxygen), and controlled variables (temperature, volumes), providing clear justifications. Essay A, however, makes a fundamental error, incorrectly identifying temperature change as the independent variable and the type of substance as the dependent variable. This reversal shows a critical misunderstanding of experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B presents a more robust and sophisticated methodology. The plan to use two distinct methods (Winkler titration and an oxygen probe) allows for cross-validation and a richer analysis, demonstrating excellent scientific foresight. Essay A's procedure is logical but, as noted, poorly conceived in terms of concentrations, making the collection of meaningful data impossible without significant post-hoc adjustments. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental section is more comprehensive, detailing specific chemical hazards and appropriate disposal methods (e.g., neutralizing acid), whereas Essay A's is more generic. While Essay A has a strong theoretical background, its fundamental flaws in experimental design and variable identification make Essay B the clear winner for Criterion B.",
