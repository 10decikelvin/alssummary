  "reasoning": "Essay B presents a superior exploration of its topic, primarily due to its clear, focused, and well-aligned research question. The question, \"How do different active ingredients...in different brands of indigestion tablets...compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\" is specific, measurable, and perfectly matches the subsequent background and methodology. The background information is also excellent, demonstrating strong personal engagement and providing the specific, balanced chemical equations for each antacid's reaction, which is a key strength. While the identification of mass as an independent variable is a minor flaw, the justification for not controlling it to reflect real-world usage is a sign of sophisticated experimental design thinking.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A suffers from a critical flaw: a significant contradiction between its research question and its methodology. The research question explicitly states the aim is \"by comparing secondary data,\" yet the entire methodology section details an elaborate primary data collection experiment using the Winkler method. This fundamental disconnect demonstrates a lack of focus and clarity, which undermines the entire exploration. While Essay A's methodology and risk assessment are exceptionally detailed and thorough\u2014arguably more so than Essay B's\u2014this detail cannot compensate for the flawed premise. Both essays impressively include a proactive evaluation of their methodology's limitations, but Essay B's overall coherence makes it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
