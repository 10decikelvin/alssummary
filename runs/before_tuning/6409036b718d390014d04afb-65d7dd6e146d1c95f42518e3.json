  "reasoning": "Both essays address the relationship between two variables affecting the distribution directly with clear and focused research questions that are well formulated. While the focus questions are very clearly stated for both experiments, what particularly needs consideration here is the extent to to which the student demonstrated individual thought and initiative in how they answered their question. The first essay is clearly more original and creative in how they approached this experiment by investigating the effect of adding an acid produced by fruits on the process of iron absorption, using the digestion system of a healthy adult as their main parameter. While the second essay had similar research design, the scope was too broad. The first student also showed a deeper understanding of the-the underlying reaction mechanisms, and the complexity of the reaction including possible ways errors may occur which demonstrates excellent engagement with the topic. The explanation could have discussed the implications of their findings in much more detail than simply acknowledging that fruits aid in dissolving kidney stones. More extensive research on the health benefits for the human body or in the development of iron supplements would have added to this further. The experimental methodology is standard school science procedure and not new, however, the student has been able to consider key factors like pH, temperature and volume of chemicals used etc. The student has included both a risk assessment that gives specific handling information for the chemicals in question and a detailed consideration of ethical points. The results were clearly written in a relevant format. The analysis provides in-depth evaluation but the conclusion could be more explicit in how it links the results to the introduction and overall, there isn'-t sufficient detail when suggesting improvements. Additionally, the candidate's use of sources is very good.",
