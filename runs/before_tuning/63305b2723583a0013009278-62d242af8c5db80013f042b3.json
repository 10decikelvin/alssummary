  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B. They both present clear, focused research questions, identify variables correctly, and provide detailed, logical procedures. Both also include commendable sections on safety and environmental considerations.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a slightly higher level of scientific engagement and a more robust experimental design. Its research question is very precise, and the background information provides a clear theoretical framework, including the mathematical formula derived from Faraday's laws. This is a significant strength as it allows for a direct quantitative comparison between experimental results and theoretical predictions, which is evident in the inclusion of a graph showing this comparison. The personal engagement feels authentic and provides a strong rationale for the investigation. The \"Limitations\" and \"Improvements\" section is also particularly insightful and self-critical.\n\nEssay B is also very strong, especially in its detailed step-by-step procedure and comprehensive table of controlled variables. The background chemistry of complexometric titration is well-explained. However, the connection between the background theory (e.g., calcium phosphate solubility) and the quantitative outcome of the titration isn't as explicitly linked with a predictive model as in Essay A. Furthermore, the personal engagement, while present, feels slightly less compelling. While both are excellent, Essay A's stronger integration of theoretical principles into its experimental design and evaluation gives it a slight edge.",
