  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is focused, clear, and outlines the precise scope of the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is convoluted and less direct about its primary goal, which appears to be determining buffer capacity.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is far more comprehensive and demonstrates a deeper level of chemical understanding. It effectively links the experiment to a real-world context, discusses previous studies, explains the chemistry of bleach, outlines the principles of spectrophotometry via the Beer-Lambert law, and even details the redox titration used to determine the initial bleach concentration. Essay A's background is adequate but less thorough, providing basic definitions without the same depth or contextualization.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is exemplary. The procedure is logically structured, including a pre-test to determine bleach concentration and optimal wavelength, which shows excellent scientific practice. The variables are clearly defined with strong justifications. Essay A's methodology is highly disorganized and difficult to follow, with procedural steps listed in a non-sequential and confusing order. Its description of variable control is also less precise. Finally, Essay B includes a detailed and thoughtful section on safety and environmental considerations, whereas Essay A's is incomplete and minimal.",
