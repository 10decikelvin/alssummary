  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of detail, rigor, and understanding of experimental design compared to Essay B, making it the superior submission for Criterion B. Essay A's research question is highly focused and specific, clearly outlining the independent variable with five distinct levels, the dependent variable, and the precise analytical technique (EDTA complexometric titration). The background information is thorough, directly relevant, and correctly explains the complex chemistry behind the titration method. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology section is exemplary, featuring an extensive table of controlled variables with clear methods and justifications for control, a well-structured and repeatable procedure, and a thoughtful comparison of analytical methods that justifies the chosen approach. The evaluation of the methodology, including safety, environmental considerations, and a detailed table of limitations with specific improvements, is exceptionally strong and demonstrates a high level of critical thinking.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's research question is less precise, and the experimental design is fundamentally flawed by only investigating two concentrations (0.5M and 1.0M), which is insufficient to establish a meaningful relationship. While the background information includes some relevant concepts like Gibbs free energy, its explanation of the link between concentration and enthalpy is simplistic and potentially confusing. The controlled variables are not as well-justified, and the procedure lacks critical details, such as how the final temperature change will be determined. Finally, the risk assessment and evaluation of weaknesses in Essay B are generic and lack the depth and insight demonstrated in Essay A.",
