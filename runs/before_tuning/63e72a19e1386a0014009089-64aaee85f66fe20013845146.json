  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger fulfillment of the IB Chemistry Criterion B requirements for Exploration. Its research question is highly focused and precise, specifying the exact concentrations of NaCl to be tested and including the uncertainty of the measurement (`0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 100.0 \u00b1 0.4 ppt`). The background information is scientifically robust, seamlessly connecting a real-world context (ocean salinity) to the underlying chemical principles of solubility, intermolecular forces (dipole-induced dipole, ion-dipole), and the specific redox reactions of the Winkler titration method. The methodology provided is detailed, logical, and includes the preparation of standard solutions, demonstrating a high level of procedural competence. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of variables and safety considerations is exemplary; the controlled variables are clearly justified with sound scientific reasoning, and the safety table is comprehensive, addressing specific chemical hazards, first aid, and environmental disposal.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question, is weaker in several key areas. The background information is more descriptive than explanatory, lacking the depth of chemical theory seen in Essay A. For example, the justification for controlling the temperature is based on an observation (\"causes bubbles to form\") rather than a principle like temperature's effect on solubility or reaction rates. The procedure is adequate but less rigorous; phrases like \"approximately 5g\" and the arbitrary control of \"32 holes\" in the foil detract from its scientific precision. The safety section is minimal, notably omitting crucial information on the proper disposal of dichloromethane, a hazardous organic solvent. Finally, Essay B incorrectly includes sections like \"Strengths,\" \"Weaknesses & Limitations,\" and \"Extension,\" which are part of the Evaluation criterion, not Exploration, indicating a misunderstanding of the IA structure.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a far more thorough, scientifically sound, and well-structured plan for the investigation, making it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
