  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and well-contextualized investigations. Essay A provides a strong theoretical background, justifying the spontaneity of the chosen redox reaction by calculating the standard cell potential and Gibbs free energy, which demonstrates a high level of chemical understanding. It also correctly identifies the importance of using a limiting reactant to isolate the effect of the independent variable. However, its methodology section contains a significant inconsistency, listing \"10M\" copper (II) sulphate in the apparatus list while stating the variable will be shifted between \"0.5M and 1.0M\". Essay B, on the other hand, is exemplary in its experimental design and clarity. Its research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is focused and well-phrased. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining the preparation of reagents and a step-by-step procedure that is easily reproducible. Crucially, Essay B explicitly plans for multiple trials (\"taking 3 readings for each specified time amount\"), a key component of a robust scientific exploration that is only vaguely implied in Essay A. Furthermore, the controlled variables in Essay B are more thoroughly justified. While Essay A's background is commendable, Essay B's superior planning, clarity, and methodological rigor make it the better example of Criterion B.",
