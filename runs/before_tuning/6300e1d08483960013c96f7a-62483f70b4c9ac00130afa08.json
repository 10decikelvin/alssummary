  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is more sophisticated and analytical than Essay A's straightforward \"To what extent do different types of salts...affect the volume of melted ice?\". Essay B's background information is exceptionally thorough, exploring the complex chemistry behind dissolved oxygen, Le Chatelier's principle, and critically evaluating multiple measurement techniques (colorimetric, sensors, Winkler) before justifying the chosen method. This depth contrasts with Essay A's competent but more superficial background on freezing point depression.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is meticulous and shows evidence of refinement through preliminary trials, a hallmark of excellent exploration. It provides specific instructions, such as using glass pipettes instead of bulb pipettes \"to reduce random error,\" and controlling for aeration when collecting water samples. Essay A's method is functional but less rigorous; for instance, it fails to specify how \"identical ice cubes\" will be ensured and proposes a sequential rather than concurrent experimental design, which could compromise the control of ambient temperature. Most critically, Essay B includes a detailed and appropriate Risk Assessment, addressing chemical hazards and environmental disposal. Essay A completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for this criterion. While Essay A presents a clear and logical investigation, Essay B excels in its depth of research, methodological rigor, and adherence to safety protocols, making it the clearly superior submission.",
