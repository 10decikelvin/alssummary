  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations for a chemistry IA. Essay B has a clear and ambitious research question focused on determining the activation energy of a reaction by varying temperature, which is a classic and robust kinetics experiment. Its background information thoroughly explains the Arrhenius equation and collision theory, providing a solid theoretical foundation. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly more impressive level of planning and methodological detail. Its research question is very specific, and the background information is exceptionally well-developed, including a detailed justification for using a spectrophotometer via the Beer-Lambert law and, crucially, a plan to determine the unknown concentration of a commercial product through titration. This shows a proactive approach to overcoming experimental challenges. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables, which details not just what is controlled but also *why* and *how*, is more comprehensive than Essay B's list. While Essay B's methodology is sound, its reliance on visual observation of a colour change introduces more potential for human error compared to Essay A's use of a spectrophotometer for data collection. Therefore, Essay A exhibits a superior depth of thought in its experimental design and justification, making its \"Exploration\" criterion slightly stronger.",
