  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections and would likely score well. Essay B provides an excellent theoretical background, thoroughly explaining collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Arrhenius equation, which perfectly contextualizes its research question on kinetics. Its personal rationale linking the investigation to future career aspirations in chemical engineering is also compelling. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior level of methodical planning and clarity in its experimental design. The use of tables to explicitly outline the independent, dependent, and controlled variables is exemplary; for each controlled variable, it provides a clear reason (\"Why was it controlled?\") and a specific method (\"How was it controlled?\"). This structured approach shows a deeper consideration of the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A's safety section is more specific, detailing disposal methods for each chemical (e.g., \"Heavily diluted and neutralized before disposing into lab sink\" for sulfuric acid) and mentioning specific personal protective equipment, whereas Essay B's safety measures are slightly more generic (e.g., \"Very careful operations during the experiment\"). While Essay B's theoretical depth is commendable, Essay A's meticulous and clearly communicated experimental design and safety protocols make it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
