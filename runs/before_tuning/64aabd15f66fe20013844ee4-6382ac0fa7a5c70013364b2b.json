  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B due to its superior scope, personal engagement, and comprehensive treatment of safety and environmental considerations, which are key components of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\", is more ambitious and demonstrates a higher level of inquiry by comparing two distinct analytical techniques. The background information is strengthened by a compelling personal narrative that explains the project's development, showing genuine intellectual initiative. Most notably, Essay B's section on \"Hazards, Concerns and Safety\" is exemplary; it identifies multiple specific risks (e.g., acid dilution, Bunsen burner use) and links them to appropriate safety measures, including a relevant environmental consideration regarding waste disposal.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a solid, standard titration experiment, and its table of controlled variables is excellent, clearly outlining the reason for control and the method of control. However, its exploration is significantly weakened by an inadequate safety section. The statement that \"Gloves are not necessary... due to the usage of a low-concentrated (0.05 mol dm\u207b\u00b3) NaOH\" is dismissive of standard laboratory practice and demonstrates a lack of safety awareness. Furthermore, this section incorrectly includes a table of experimental limitations, indicating poor structure. While Essay B has a notable methodological flaw in its procedure\u2014specifying a measuring cylinder instead of a pipette for taking an aliquot\u2014this is a weakness in one aspect of its otherwise more thorough and sophisticated exploration. Overall, Essay B's breadth, depth of engagement, and excellent handling of safety and environmental aspects make it a stronger example of Criterion B.",
