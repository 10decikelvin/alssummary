  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher quality of exploration (Criterion B) compared to Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is highly focused, specific, and shows clear personal engagement. The student justifies the acidic pH range by researching the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082 and the environmental significance of acidic wastewater, showcasing critical thinking beyond the syllabus. Essay A's methodology is exceptionally thorough, outlining preliminary trials that informed key decisions like adsorption time and the upper pH limit, and the detailed procedure is easily replicable. The table of variables is comprehensive, with excellent justifications for each controlled variable.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's research questions about the effect of carbon chain length on enthalpy of combustion and boiling point are very standard and lack a unique investigative angle. While the background information is scientifically correct, it is generic and covers fundamental concepts directly from the syllabus without demonstrating independent research to the same extent as Essay A. The methodology for this database investigation is brief, simply naming sources without detailing the process of data collection, curation, or how discrepancies would be handled. Most importantly, Essay B completely omits a dedicated section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a key component of this criterion. While Essay B presents a competent plan for a database IA, Essay A's experimental design is far more sophisticated, well-researched, and thoughtfully constructed.",
