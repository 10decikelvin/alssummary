  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the effect of changing temperatures... on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\", is focused, quantitative, and perfectly framed for a scientific investigation. The background section of Essay B is exceptional, seamlessly integrating complex concepts like Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, Le Chatelier's Principle, and the Beer-Lambert law to provide a robust theoretical foundation for the experiment. In contrast, Essay A's research question is more descriptive than investigative, and its background is superficial, relying on a personal anecdote for justification rather than deep scientific principles.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is meticulous, evidenced by the inclusion of preliminary experiments to refine the procedure and a highly detailed, replicable method that specifies equipment uncertainties. The treatment of variables in Essay B is also far more sophisticated, with in-depth scientific justifications for why each variable must be controlled. Essay A's methodology and variable control are adequate for a basic experiment but lack the same level of scientific rigor; for instance, the reason for controlling temperature is weakly explained as preventing \"bubbles to form\" rather than discussing its effect on solubility and extraction efficiency. Finally, Essay B presents an exemplary section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, addressing specific chemical hazards and disposal protocols, whereas Essay A provides only minimal safety points and completely omits any discussion of environmental or ethical issues.",
