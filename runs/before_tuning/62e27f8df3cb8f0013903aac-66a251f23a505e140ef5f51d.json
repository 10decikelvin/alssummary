  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating clear understanding of experimental design. However, Essay B is superior due to its more robust methodology and deeper integration of chemical principles into the experimental design.\n\nEssay A has a well-defined research question and a thorough background section that correctly links reaction kinetics, the Arrhenius equation, and the Beer-Lambert law. Its safety analysis is comprehensive, even considering the reaction product. However, its methodology has a significant potential weakness in temperature control: heating reactants separately and then mixing them in a cuvette introduces a high risk of temperature fluctuation and heat loss, which is critical in an experiment investigating the effect of temperature. While the student acknowledges this in the evaluation, a stronger design would have mitigated it from the outset.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, showcases a more sophisticated and sound experimental design. Its research question is equally focused. The background is exceptional, not only explaining the necessary concepts like equilibrium, Kc, and the Van't Hoff equation but also integrating advanced concepts like Gibbs free energy to provide a deeper theoretical context. Critically, the preliminary work described in Essay B directly addresses a potential confounding variable (the color of the Fe\u00b3\u207a ion) and leads to a key methodological refinement (the addition of nitric acid), demonstrating a thoughtful and iterative scientific process. The two-part methodology (creating a calibration curve, then measuring the equilibrium constant) is logical, clear, and represents standard laboratory practice for this type of investigation, making the proposed method more reliable and valid than that of Essay A.\n\nIn summary, while both are high-quality, Essay B's superior experimental design, more rigorous consideration of variables demonstrated through its preliminary work, and deeper theoretical background make it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
