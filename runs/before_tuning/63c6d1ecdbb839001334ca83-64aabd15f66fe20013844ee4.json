  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design and chemical principles. The research question is highly focused, and the background information provides a clear, quantitative justification for the chosen concentration of the titrant (KMnO\u2084). The methodology is sound, specific, and appropriate for isolating and quantifying the variable of interest (Fe\u00b2\u207a). The identification and control of variables are detailed and well-reasoned. In contrast, while Essay B presents a clear structure, its chosen methodology is fundamentally flawed for its research question; a simple acid-base titration cannot differentiate ascorbic acid from other acids (like citric acid) present in orange juice, thus measuring total acidity rather than the specific vitamin C content. Essay A also offers a more comprehensive consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental aspects. While both essays show good reflective thinking by discussing limitations, Essay A's plan is scientifically more rigorous and viable from the outset.",
