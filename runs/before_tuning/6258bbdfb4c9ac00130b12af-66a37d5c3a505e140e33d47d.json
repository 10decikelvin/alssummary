  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a superior and more rigorous approach to experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. The research question is well-defined, and the background information provides a strong theoretical foundation for two distinct chemical analyses (Acid Value and Saponification Value), showcasing a deeper level of chemical understanding than Essay B. The most significant strength of Essay A lies in its meticulous identification and control of variables. The controlled variables table is comprehensive, addressing subtle but crucial factors like \"Moisture,\" \"Microbial Contamination,\" \"Light,\" and, most importantly, the \"Time period\" of heating. As the author correctly notes, \"Time is one of the other variable which affects quantity of FFA in sample hence it needs to be controlled.\"\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while well-structured with a clear RQ and good background on Vitamin C, contains a critical flaw in its methodology. The procedure fails to control for the duration of heating. The instructions state to heat the juice until it reaches the desired temperature and then titrate it immediately. Since the degradation of Vitamin C is dependent on both temperature and the time exposed to that temperature, this lack of control over the heating period severely undermines the validity of the investigation. Essay A\u2019s method to heat all samples for a fixed \"time period of 60 minutes\" is a much more scientifically sound approach to isolating the effect of temperature. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology includes the standardization of its titrants, a sophisticated step that demonstrates a higher level of procedural rigor. While Essay A incorrectly uses the term \"Soxhlet apparatus\" for heating, this is a minor terminology error compared to the fundamental design flaw in Essay B. Overall, Essay A presents a more complex, better-controlled, and more thoughtfully designed exploration.",
