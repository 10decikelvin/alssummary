  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its greater depth, complexity, and demonstration of sophisticated scientific thinking. Essay B's research question is highly focused and investigates a more complex chemical concept (the effect of conjugate base/acid ratio on buffer capacity) compared to Essay A's more standard investigation of temperature's effect on vitamin C. The background information in Essay B is exceptionally thorough, incorporating the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and multiple formulas for buffer capacity, which shows a profound engagement with the underlying theory. A key strength of Essay B is the dedicated \"Development of Methodology\" section, which explicitly justifies the choice of variables and cites the adaptation of a university-level experiment, showcasing a mature and reflective approach to experimental design.\n\nEssay A is also excellent; its research question is clear, the background is well-explained, and the methodology is meticulously detailed with a particularly well-structured controlled variables table that includes the reason for control. The procedure is clear and easy to follow, and its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are thoughtful, especially the mention of food waste. However, Essay B's exploration feels more advanced and conceptually challenging. While Essay A follows a very effective template for a high-scoring IA, Essay B's integration of advanced theoretical concepts into its rationale and methodology elevates it to a higher standard of scientific exploration. The use of modern data-logging technology in Essay B's method further supports its more sophisticated approach.",
