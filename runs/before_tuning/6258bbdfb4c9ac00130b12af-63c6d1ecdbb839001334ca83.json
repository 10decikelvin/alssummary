  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a solid framework for a good investigation, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness, understanding, and personal engagement in the experimental design process.\n\n**Research Question:** Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of HCl (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) affect the solubility of iron(II) by measuring the mass of iron(II) extracted from 1 iron tablet via titration with acidified potassium permanganate?\", is significantly more focused and precise than Essay A's. It clearly defines the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (mass of iron(II)), and the specific methods of measurement. Essay A's RQ is more of a statement of intent (\"Investigating effect of...\") and is less concise.\n\n**Background & Context:** Essay B excels here. It provides a real-world context (anemia), details the underlying chemistry (oxidation states, precipitation), includes balanced equations, and even justifies the concentration of the titrant used. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. Essay A's background is adequate but less comprehensive; for instance, it states that the effect on saponification value cannot be hypothesized due to a lack of research, which might indicate a less thorough literature review.\n\n**Methodology & Control of Variables:** Both essays present detailed, logical procedures. Essay A's inclusion of steps for standardizing solutions is commendable. However, its use of a \"Soxhlet apparatus\" for heating is likely incorrect terminology (a heating mantle would be more appropriate), which slightly undermines its credibility. Essay B shows a more refined experimental design by explicitly stating that the range of the independent variable was modified based on preliminary trials, indicating a more iterative and scientific approach. The control variables in both are well-considered, but Essay B's justification for its chosen pH range is particularly strong.\n\n**Safety & Other Considerations:** Both essays have good safety sections. Essay B's is slightly stronger due to its specificity and citation of safety sources (CLEAPSS, Carl Roth). Furthermore, Essay B includes sections on \"Assumptions,\" \"Alternative Methodology,\" and \"Extension,\" which, while not strictly part of Criterion B, showcase a deeper level of critical thinking and engagement with the scientific process that is indicative of a superior plan.\n\nOverall, while Essay A presents a viable and well-structured plan, Essay B is superior due to its more focused research question, more in-depth background research, stronger justification for its experimental design choices, and a more thorough consideration of the entire scientific process.",
