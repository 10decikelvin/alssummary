  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of exploration and planning, making it the stronger essay for Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying not just the variables but also the precise concentrations, mass of reactant, and timeframe: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids...in HCl solutions of varying concentrations...measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". This specificity reflects a well-thought-out plan. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section, which justifies the chosen concentrations and duration, a hallmark of excellent experimental design. The safety, ethical, and environmental considerations in Essay B are exemplary, presented in a detailed table with hazard symbols and a thoughtful discussion on waste minimization and proper disposal.\n\nWhile Essay A presents a competent investigation with a clear research question and relevant background on the \"diverse ion effect,\" it is less thorough in its exploration. The methodology section in Essay A is less detailed, and critically, it lacks any discussion of preliminary trials or justification for the chosen parameters. Its safety section is adequate but brief, and it completely omits any environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant weakness compared to Essay B's comprehensive treatment of the topic. Therefore, due to its more detailed planning, justification of methodology through pre-testing, and outstanding attention to safety and environmental impact, Essay B is clearly better.",
