  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused, specific, and includes both the independent variable with its precise values and uncertainty (\"varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C)\") and the dependent variables with their method of measurement. The methodology is a standout feature, as the student details the thoughtful process of selecting the best measurement technique, moving from visual observation to a colorimeter and finally to a lux sensor, which shows excellent procedural refinement. Furthermore, the table of controlled variables is exemplary, providing not just a list, but also a justification for control and the specific method of control for each factor. The safety and environmental considerations are thorough, identifying specific chemical hazards, mitigation strategies, and even a modification to the procedure (reducing reagent volumes) to minimize environmental impact.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a valid database investigation with a clear personal motivation rooted in sustainability, it is weaker across several aspects of Criterion B. It formulates two separate research questions rather than a single, integrated one, which is less focused. Its methodology section is brief and, by nature of being a database study, lacks the complexity and demonstration of experimental design seen in Essay A. Although it correctly identifies a key control (using only linear primary alcohols), the discussion of variables is far less detailed than in Essay A. Most critically, Essay B completely omits any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations related to the investigation itself, which is a significant oversight for this criterion. Essay A's hands-on experimental design simply allows for a more comprehensive and skillful demonstration of the requirements for Exploration.",
