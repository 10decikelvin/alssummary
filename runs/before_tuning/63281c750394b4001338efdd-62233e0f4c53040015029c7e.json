  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a direct relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In contrast, Essay B's research question is convoluted and unfocused: \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\". This phrasing suggests two independent variables (temperature and added NaOH), making the investigation's primary goal unclear.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background section provides a strong theoretical foundation, explaining the expected outcome at a molecular level (\"The ions of potassium nitrate are held in a rigid matrix of water molecules\") and cleverly uses an analogous graph for NaCl solutions to support its hypothesis. Essay B's background contains relevant chemical principles like the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation but is less coherent in linking temperature directly to the buffer's overall behavior. The most significant difference lies in the methodology. Essay A presents a logical, sequential, and replicable procedure. Conversely, Essay B's procedure is exceptionally poorly organized, with numbered sections presented in a non-chronological and illogical order, making it nearly impossible to follow. Finally, Essay A addresses safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, whereas Essay B's safety section is incomplete and omits any mention of ethical or environmental aspects.",
