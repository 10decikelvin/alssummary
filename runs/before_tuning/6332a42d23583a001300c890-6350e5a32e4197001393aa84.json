  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a significantly more focused and methodologically sound exploration. Its research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is clear, precise, and highly appropriate for an IB Chemistry investigation. The background section provides excellent theoretical depth, explaining collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and crucially, the Arrhenius equation which forms the basis for the entire analysis. The methodology is meticulous, with detailed steps for solution preparation (including accounting for reagent purity) and a clear experimental procedure that is easily replicable. In contrast, Essay B's research question is convoluted, attempting to investigate three things at once: the effect of salinity on dissolved oxygen (DO), a comparison of different water sources, and a comparison of two analytical methods (Winkler vs. probe). This lack of focus creates a muddled methodology and a critical flaw in variable control; by using \"different water sources,\" it introduces countless uncontrolled variables (like organic content and initial DO) that confound the results related to the stated independent variable, NaCl concentration. While Essay B's background on the Winkler method is adequate, it lacks the theoretical depth of Essay A. Finally, Essay A's identification and control of variables are exemplary, whereas Essay B fails to even identify the water source as a second independent variable, which fundamentally weakens its experimental design.",
