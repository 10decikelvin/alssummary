  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration of its research question compared to Essay A. The research question in Essay B, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is focused, clear, and well-suited for an investigation of this scope. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to tackle two independent variables (anion type and temperature), which reduces the focus of the investigation.\n\nEssay B excels in providing thorough and relevant background information, including the theoretical basis for why specific heat capacity should change with concentration, referencing \"a rigid matrix of water molecules.\" It also incorporates literature values and an analogous graph for NaCl solutions, demonstrating strong scientific context. Essay A's background is much more superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B presents a clear, detailed, and replicable procedure using calorimetry, with specific quantities mentioned (e.g., \"100g of distilled water\"). Essay A's methodology has a critical flaw: it fails to specify the volume of solvent used, making it impossible to calculate solubility and rendering the procedure non-replicable. Furthermore, Essay B correctly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, presenting the controlled variables in a well-organized table. Essay A incorrectly identifies its variables, confusing the independent variable (concentration/mass of salt) with the dependent variable (crystallization temperature). Finally, Essay B's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors is more comprehensive than Essay A's.",
