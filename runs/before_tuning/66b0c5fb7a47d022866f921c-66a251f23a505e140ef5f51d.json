  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and relevant investigations suitable for the IB Chemistry level. Essay A's exploration of gasohol combustion is grounded in a strong real-world context, with a clear research question and a logical, replicable methodology. Its strengths include a thoughtful justification for the range of concentrations tested and excellent qualitative observations regarding soot production, which are linked back to the underlying chemistry of incomplete combustion. However, its description of the dependent variable is slightly imprecise, stating it as \"mass of the fuel burnt\" rather than the calculated enthalpy of combustion, and its risk assessment section is quite brief.\n\nEssay B, investigating the effect of temperature on an equilibrium constant, is demonstrably superior due to its exceptional depth and rigor. The background information is comprehensive, integrating high-level concepts like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation with Le Chatelier's principle to provide a robust theoretical framework. A key strength is the inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments,\" which showcases an iterative and reflective approach to refining the methodology\u2014a hallmark of excellent scientific exploration. The variables are controlled with meticulous detail, and the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are far more specific and thorough than in Essay A. The two-part methodology (calibration curve and equilibrium determination) reflects a more complex and sophisticated experimental design, demonstrating a higher level of planning and understanding. While Essay A represents a very competent piece of work, Essay B's depth of theoretical understanding, meticulous planning, and sophisticated experimental design make it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
