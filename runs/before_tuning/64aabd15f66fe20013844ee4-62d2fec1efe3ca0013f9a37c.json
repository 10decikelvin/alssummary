  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a solid foundation for a good investigation, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and thoroughness required for the top mark bands of Criterion B.\n\nEssay A presents a clear, albeit standard, investigation. The personal engagement is evident, and the research question is well-defined. The background information correctly explains the chemistry of acid-base titrations. The methodology is detailed, with an excellent table outlining the controlled variables and the reasons for controlling them. However, its safety section is minimal, only briefly mentioning that gloves are not necessary and to use a pipette filler, while completely omitting any environmental considerations for disposal. It also incorrectly places a \"Limitations\" table (which belongs in the Evaluation criterion) within the methodology section.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, is exemplary. The research question is more sophisticated, linking two different chemical concepts (kinetics and acid-base strength). The background information is comprehensive, effectively connecting reaction rates, the Arrhenius equation, and catalyst properties to formulate a testable hypothesis based on pKa values. The methodology is meticulously planned, including the preparation of solutions from stock chemicals and a procedure for controlling temperature across a range. Crucially, the section on safety and environmental considerations is far superior, identifying multiple specific hazards (flammability, irritants, lachrymators) and providing correct disposal procedures for different chemical wastes. This demonstrates a much stronger awareness of the practical realities of working in a laboratory.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is competent, Essay B is more rigorous, demonstrates a deeper understanding of chemical principles, and shows a much more developed approach to planning and safety, making it the stronger of the two.",
