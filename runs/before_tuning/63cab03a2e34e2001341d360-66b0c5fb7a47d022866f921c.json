  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a higher quality of exploration (Criterion B) overall. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is exceptionally clear, focused, and directly testable. In contrast, Essay A's research question is convoluted and ambiguous, mixing primary data collection (Winkler's method) with a poorly defined independent variable based on \"pollution level\" which is classified using secondary data. Essay B's treatment of variables is exemplary; it presents controlled variables in a detailed table explaining *why* and *how* they are controlled, and it provides a thoughtful justification for the range of the independent variable and the choice of units for the dependent variable. While Essay A's methodology is chemically complex and its safety assessment is more detailed chemical-by-chemical, its variables section is comparatively superficial. Furthermore, Essay B integrates strong qualitative observations (soot formation) with a chemical explanation and makes a sophisticated point about how systematic error affects the trend but not the overall conclusion, showcasing a deeper level of critical thinking about the experimental design. Essay A has strengths in its detailed procedure and background chemistry, but Essay B's superior focus, justification, and depth of thought in its experimental design make it the better essay.",
