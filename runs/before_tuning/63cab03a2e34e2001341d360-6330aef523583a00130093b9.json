  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay A due to its comprehensive and well-executed methodology, which is the cornerstone of Criterion B. Essay A presents an exceptionally detailed and replicable procedure, including specific instructions for preparing reagents and standardizing the titrant (\"Dissolved 91 grams or 0.602 moles of Manganese Sulfate...\"). Its identification of variables is clear and correct, and the risk assessment is meticulous, breaking down hazards for each chemical in a structured table. Furthermore, Essay A demonstrates high-level thinking by proactively outlining assumptions and a table of methodological limitations, showing foresight in its experimental design.\n\nWhile Essay B has a strong theoretical background, illustrated by excellent Hess's law diagrams, it has critical flaws in its experimental planning. Most significantly, it incorrectly identifies the independent and dependent variables, stating that temperature change is the independent variable when it is in fact the dependent one. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design. The procedure, as acknowledged by the author in the evaluation section, was not viable as the chosen concentrations were too low to produce measurable temperature changes. Although this self-reflection is honest, it highlights a failure in the planning phase, which is what Criterion B assesses. Essay A's methodology is sound and fit for purpose, whereas Essay B's is fundamentally flawed, making Essay A superior in demonstrating the qualities of exploration.",
