  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across nearly all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a precise relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In contrast, Essay B's question is awkwardly phrased and less focused: \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\". The most significant difference lies in the background information; Essay A provides a thorough theoretical context, including the Arrhenius equation and a full derivation of the integrated rate law that directly justifies the experimental method. Essay B, however, offers almost no scientific background, failing to explain complexometric titration, the role of EDTA, or any chemical reason why calcium content might change over time.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is exemplary. It clearly defines the independent, dependent, and control variables with sound justifications, and the procedure is detailed enough to be easily replicated. Essay B's methodology is incomplete, as it is missing the first five steps of its procedure and fails to systematically identify or justify its control variables. While both essays provide adequate safety considerations, with Essay B's being quite detailed, this single strength cannot compensate for its fundamental weaknesses in scientific planning and context. Overall, Essay A presents a coherent, well-researched, and scientifically rigorous plan for an investigation, whereas Essay B's exploration is underdeveloped and lacks the necessary detail and theoretical foundation expected at this level.",
