  "reasoning": "Both essays present exceptionally strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements for exploration. Essay A is methodologically sound, with a focused research question, a logical progression from personal interest to scientific inquiry, and excellent detail in its variables and procedure. The justification for the voltage range, by \"challenging\" the advice for amateur jewellers, shows thoughtful engagement. Furthermore, its sections on controlled variables and safety/environmental considerations are thorough and well-explained, for instance, detailing exactly how the distance between electrodes will be maintained using a marked wooden splint.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific maturity and a more authentic exploration process. The topic itself, the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, is more complex and original. The background information connects the chemical phenomenon to a sophisticated real-world application in cardiac arrhythmia research, indicating deep engagement. The standout feature of Essay B is the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, where the author explicitly details the iterative process of selecting an appropriate measurement device, moving from subjective observation to a colorimeter and finally settling on a lux sensor. This narrative of preliminary testing and problem-solving (\"Initially, using a stopwatch and recording on the phone yielded mediocre results...\") is a hallmark of a superior scientific exploration. While Essay A presents a polished final plan, Essay B provides insight into the scientific thinking and development that led to that plan, which is the core of this criterion. Essay B's conscious decision to scale down the experiment to reduce its \"environmental and financial footprint\" also shows a more thoughtful level of consideration. Therefore, due to its more sophisticated topic, deeper scientific context, and outstanding demonstration of the methodological development process, Essay B is the stronger of the two.",
