  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question is sophisticated, focused, and stems from a well-articulated scientific rationale linking a theoretical concept (buffer capacity) to a real-world application (biological systems). The background information is exceptionally strong, incorporating the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and multiple formulas for buffer capacity, citing academic sources, and showing a deep theoretical understanding of the topic. In contrast, Essay A's research question is simpler, and while the rationale has personal engagement, the scientific link between \"least ascorbic acid\" and \"healthiest for teeth\" is an oversimplification.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is far more robust. The \"Development of Methodology\" section shows thoughtful planning and adaptation from a university-level experiment. Its procedure is detailed, replicable, and incorporates modern data-logging technology (pH probe, drop counter) for precise measurements. Essay A's methodology, while clearly described, has a fundamental scientific flaw: titrating with NaOH neutralizes all acids in the orange juice (citric, malic, etc.), not just ascorbic acid. Although the student commendably identifies this limitation, the choice of an inappropriate method in the first place is a major weakness in the exploration phase.\n\nFinally, Essay B includes a comprehensive and professional risk assessment that correctly identifies hazards and outlines mitigation strategies, including proper PPE. Essay A's safety section is dangerously inadequate, dismissing the need for gloves with a caustic substance and failing to mention safety glasses, which is a critical omission. Overall, Essay B's exploration is more scientifically rigorous, demonstrates deeper background knowledge, and presents a more thoughtfully designed and safer experimental plan.",
