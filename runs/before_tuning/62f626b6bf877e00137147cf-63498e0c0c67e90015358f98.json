  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards for Exploration. Essay B is unequivocally superior across all aspects of this criterion.\n\nFirst, Essay B presents a clear, focused, and well-contextualized research question: \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\". It is immediately followed by a compelling introduction that demonstrates personal engagement and establishes the scientific relevance of the investigation. In stark contrast, Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased (\"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant...\") and its introduction is a single, generic sentence that provides no context or scientific background.\n\nSecond, Essay B's background section is thorough, demonstrating a strong understanding of complex concepts like solvation, ionic strength, and the \"salting in\" effect, supported by relevant diagrams and literature data. Essay A completely lacks a scientific background section, failing to explain the chemistry of complexometric titration, the role of EDTA, or why calcium content in milk might change over time.\n\nThird, the methodology in Essay B is sophisticated, detailed, and replicable, including a preliminary calibration experiment and a clear procedure with specific quantities and settings. Conversely, Essay A's methodology is incomplete, missing critical details like sample volumes and preparation, and contains fundamental scientific errors regarding the indicator color change in an EDTA titration (stating a change from \"blue to pink\" when the opposite is correct).\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its identification and justification of variables. It provides a detailed table explaining not only what the controlled variables are, but also why and how they are controlled, which is a hallmark of excellent experimental design. Essay A completely omits any discussion of variables, a critical failure in Criterion B.\n\nFinally, while both essays include a risk assessment, Essay B's is tailored to its procedure, and the overall planning, evident in its detailed methodology and variable control, showcases a far more thoughtful and scientifically rigorous approach to the exploration process. Essay A's plan is superficial, flawed, and lacks the depth required for a successful investigation.",
