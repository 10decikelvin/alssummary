  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide some relevant information, but Sample B is stronger. Sample A presents a clearer and more focused research question and directly addresses it through a simple and logical experimental design. The method is detailed and easy to follow.  The uncertainty analysis, while basic, shows an attempt to consider experimental error. The conclusion directly addresses the initial hypothesis, making for a cohesive report. In contrast, Sample B, while presenting a more complex procedure, suffers from a lack of clarity in its research question and a less structured methodology. For example, it mentions titrating 'until the pH changes by 1' which is an ambiguous endpoint and not standard practice for complexometric titrations. Furthermore, the risk assessment in Sample B seems more generic, whereas Sample A provides more specific and relevant safety precautions. While both could benefit from more detailed background information and analysis, Sample A provides a more complete and coherent investigation for the given task.",
