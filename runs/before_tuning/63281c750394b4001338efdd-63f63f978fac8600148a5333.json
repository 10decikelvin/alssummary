  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary distinction lies in the depth of research, the complexity of the scientific thinking, and the meticulousness of the experimental design. Essay B's research question is highly focused and demonstrates significant personal engagement by justifying the specific acidic pH range based on preliminary research into copper hydroxide precipitation (\"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4...Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\"). In contrast, Essay A's research question is standard and lacks the same level of sophisticated justification.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information is comprehensive, linking the investigation to real-world pollution issues and providing detailed chemical mechanisms for biosorption, including ion exchange and chelation. Essay A's background is adequate but comparatively superficial, relying on a simple analogy to NaCl solution. The methodology of Essay B is its greatest strength; the inclusion of a \"Preliminary Trials\" section shows a proactive, iterative approach to experimental design, where problems were identified and solved before the main experiment. Essay A's methodology is less robust, and the included \"Evaluation\" section reveals significant flaws in the plan that were not addressed (\"the calorimeters used were too old, therefore the copper vessels... sometimes melted\"), indicating poor planning. Finally, Essay B's control of variables is more thorough and well-justified, and its environmental considerations are specific (\"disposed in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\"), whereas Essay A's are generic.",
