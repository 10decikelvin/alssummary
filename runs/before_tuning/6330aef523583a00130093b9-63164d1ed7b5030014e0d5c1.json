  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design, which is central to Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is clear and focused. Most importantly, Essay B correctly and thoroughly identifies the independent (time in water bath), dependent (Vitamin C content), and controlled variables, justifying why each control is necessary. In contrast, Essay A fundamentally misunderstands experimental variables, incorrectly identifying \"Temperature change\" as the independent variable and \"Different types of substances\" as the dependent variable; this is a major conceptual error. While Essay A's topic is theoretically more complex and its background section is detailed, its experimental methodology is critically flawed due to the use of concentrations too low to produce a measurable temperature change, a weakness the student only identifies later. Essay B's methodology, a standard redox titration, is sound, well-detailed, and appropriate for answering its research question. Finally, both essays have adequate safety sections, but Essay B's overall structural clarity and correct application of the scientific method make it superior for the Exploration criterion.",
