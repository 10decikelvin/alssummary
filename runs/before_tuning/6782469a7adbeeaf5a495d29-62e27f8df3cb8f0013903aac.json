  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a superior level of scientific inquiry and experimental design, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and situated within a compelling real-world context of industrial pollution, which is thoroughly explored in the background section. The methodology is particularly strong, showing evidence of thoughtful preliminary trials that led to significant and justified modifications, such as changing the concentration of Methyl Orange to fit the optimal absorbance range of the spectrophotometer and adjusting the sampling frequency. Furthermore, Essay A's evaluation of limitations is exceptionally insightful, discussing subtle but significant issues like the changing depth of the solution, the potential decomposition of H\u2082O\u2082, and the intrinsic limitations of UV-Vis spectrometry (stray light, Schott noise).\n\nEssay B is also a very competent piece of work with a clear research question and a solid theoretical background on the iodination of propanone and the Arrhenius equation. The safety section in Essay B is more detailed and better structured than in Essay A. However, its methodology contains a notable flaw: the decision to not mix the reactants upon combining them. This introduces diffusion as an uncontrolled variable, which could significantly impact the measured reaction rate, a critical oversight in a kinetics experiment. While the evaluation in Essay B identifies some valid weaknesses, such as temperature loss and reactant evaporation, it lacks the depth and sophistication seen in Essay A's analysis of its own procedure and equipment. Overall, Essay A presents a more rigorous, well-justified, and critically evaluated experimental plan.",
