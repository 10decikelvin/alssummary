  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger performance in Criterion B (Exploration). Its research question is sophisticated, focused, and appropriate for the IB level: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\". The background section is exemplary, providing a detailed theoretical framework including the reaction mechanism, rate laws, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which directly justify the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B includes a section on \"Preliminary Testing,\" which is a hallmark of excellent exploration, showing that the student refined their methodology based on initial trials. The identification and control of variables are meticulous, and the safety and environmental considerations are thorough, addressing specific chemical hazards and disposal methods.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A, while having a clear structure, suffers from a critical methodological flaw. The research question aims to measure ascorbic acid concentration using an acid-base titration with NaOH. However, the student fails to recognize in the background/planning phase that orange juice contains other significant acids (like citric acid), which will also react with the NaOH titrant. This means the experiment will measure total acidity, not specifically ascorbic acid concentration. While this is correctly identified as a limitation later in the report, a strong exploration would have anticipated this issue and selected a more appropriate method, such as a redox titration with iodine. Additionally, Essay A's safety section is perfunctory, stating \"No other special safety precautions are required,\" which is insufficient. Essay B's comprehensive and well-justified approach to the entire experimental design makes it clearly superior.",
