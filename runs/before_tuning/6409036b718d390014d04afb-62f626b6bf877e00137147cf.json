  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A presents a highly focused and well-articulated research question: \"How does varying temperature...affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator...\". This is supported by an extensive and insightful background section that not only explains the underlying chemistry (redox, reaction rates, mechanisms) but also provides a compelling real-world context by linking the BZ reaction to cardiac arrhythmia. In contrast, Essay B's research question is awkwardly phrased (\"Using Complexometric Titration will determine...\") and lacks a proper scientific background, offering only a single sentence to define titration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is exemplary. It includes a thoughtful \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that justifies the use of a lux sensor over other options, demonstrating a process of preliminary investigation and problem-solving. The procedure is clear and replicable, and the variables are meticulously identified and controlled, as shown in the detailed table. Conversely, Essay B's methodology is incomplete (starting at step 6) and disorganized, with no clear list of apparatus and no discussion of controlled variables, which are critical for a titration experiment.\n\nFinally, both essays address safety, but Essay A's approach is more comprehensive. It not only lists specific chemical hazards and mitigation strategies but also demonstrates environmental consideration by explaining how the experimental scale was reduced to minimize waste. Essay B's risk assessment is adequate but lacks this level of thoughtfulness. Overall, Essay A demonstrates a sophisticated and thorough approach to experimental design, while Essay B is superficial and incomplete.",
