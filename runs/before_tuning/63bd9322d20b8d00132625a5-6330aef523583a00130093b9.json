  "reasoning": "Both essays present a reasonable attempt at an IA, but Essay A is stronger. Essay A clearly states its research question and provides a well-organized methodology, whereas Essay B's research question is somewhat convoluted and its methodology is presented in a less structured manner. The data presentation in Essay A is more direct, with a clear graph comparing experimental to literature values. In contrast, Essay B's numerous graphs of raw temperature data are less impactful and more difficult to interpret without further analysis, which is only partially provided. The evaluation of results in Essay A is more insightful, correctly identifying the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical values and proposing plausible systematic errors like heat loss and incomplete combustion. Essay B's evaluation is less developed and struggles to clearly explain the discrepancies observed. While both reports could benefit from more detailed analysis and clearer connections between results and conclusions, Essay A presents a more coherent and scientifically sound investigation from start to finish. For instance, the discussion of the difference in enthalpy of combustion based on the number of carbon atoms shows a deeper understanding than what is presented in Essay B. The inclusion of a detailed table of errors and potential improvements in Essay A also adds to its overall quality.",
