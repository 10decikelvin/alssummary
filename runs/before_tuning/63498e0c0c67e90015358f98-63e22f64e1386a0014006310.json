  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more sophisticated and well-designed investigation, making it superior in Criterion B. The research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is focused, specific, and appropriately complex for the IB level. The methodology is its greatest strength; it is scientifically sound and demonstrates careful planning, including a crucial preliminary \"Calibration experiment procedure\" which is essential for the Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law application. Furthermore, the table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only identifying the variables but also thoroughly justifying *why* and explaining *how* they are controlled.\n\nEssay B, while well-structured, is based on a very common topic and contains a significant flaw in its experimental design. The procedure states, \"Once the temperature hit 30\u00b0C, the cap of the spirit burner was placed and the final mass was recorded.\" This approach is methodologically unsound because it fixes the final temperature rather than measuring the temperature change (\u0394T) resulting from burning a known mass of fuel. This flawed design fundamentally compromises the collection of valid data to calculate the enthalpy of combustion, which is the core dependent variable. Although Essay B has a slightly more detailed safety section, this does not compensate for the critical error in its proposed methodology. Essay A\u2019s plan is far more likely to yield valid and reliable results, demonstrating a deeper understanding of experimental design. Therefore, Essay A exhibits a much higher quality of exploration.",
