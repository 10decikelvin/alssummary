  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations for a chemistry IA, but Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated research question, stronger scientific context, and more thorough consideration of controlled variables. Essay B's research question, investigating how oil saturation levels affect the rate of the Maillard reaction, is born from a clear gap identified in existing literature (\"research on this was very limited...these researches were based on experiments conducted using model foods... I decided to research...using real food\"). This demonstrates a high level of scientific inquiry and personal engagement. Furthermore, its background section excellently links personal interest in cooking to complex chemical principles like AGEs and the Beer-Lambert law, and its detailed table of controlled variables shows an outstanding depth of thought regarding experimental design.\n\nEssay A is also very strong, particularly in its methodology and risk assessment. The procedure, which includes a detailed standardization of the sodium thiosulfate titrant, demonstrates excellent practical chemical knowledge. Its risk assessment is comprehensive, listing specific hazards and precautions for each chemical used, which is far superior to Essay B's perfunctory safety notes. However, Essay A's research question is less focused, and its justification for classifying water sources by \"pollution level\" is primarily qualitative and less rigorous than Essay B's use of quantitative saturation data. While Essay A executes a classic experiment very well, Essay B's exploration is more original and demonstrates a deeper level of critical thinking in its design and justification, making it the better example for Criterion B despite its weaker safety section.",
