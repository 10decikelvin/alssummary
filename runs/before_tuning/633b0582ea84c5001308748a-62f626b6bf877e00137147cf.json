  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much more thorough and well-developed exploration. Its research questions are clear, focused, and directly addressed by a comprehensive background section that contextualizes the investigation within the real-world issue of sustainable fuels. Essay A's background skillfully explains the underlying chemical principles, such as intermolecular forces and enthalpy of combustion, providing a strong theoretical foundation for its hypotheses. Furthermore, its methodology for a database study is impeccable; it identifies reliable sources, specifies the scope (e.g., \"only linear primary alcohols\"), and outlines clear procedures for data processing, demonstrating foresight and control.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is severely underdeveloped and fundamentally flawed. The research question is awkwardly phrased, and the introduction is a single, generic sentence that provides no relevant scientific background on milk, calcium, or complexometric titration. The most critical weakness is the complete disconnect between the research question\u2014which investigates changes over time related to an expiration date\u2014and the methodology, which describes a single titration experiment with no mention of sampling at different time points. Essay B also fails to explicitly identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. While it includes a competent risk assessment, this single strength cannot compensate for the lack of background and the flawed experimental design that fails to address its own research question.",
