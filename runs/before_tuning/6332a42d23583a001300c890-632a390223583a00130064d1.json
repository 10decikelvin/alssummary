  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of experimental design, but Essay B is superior in its depth, sophistication, and critical awareness. Essay A presents a classic and well-structured investigation into chemical kinetics. Its research question is clear, the background theory is well-explained with relevant equations, and the methodology is logical, including good details like accounting for reagent purity and determining the limiting reactant. However, Essay B's exploration is more impressive due to its originality and the complexity of the topic. The student in Essay B not only provides a thorough background linking polymer chemistry to the physical concept of Young's Modulus but also designs a more sophisticated measurement process using a force sensor and video analysis software (Tracker), which significantly enhances precision over Essay A's reliance on visual color change and manual timing.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is exemplary. It uses a clear table to explicitly link each controlled variable to its method of control and, crucially, explains *why* it must be controlled. Essay A lists its controlled variables but with less detailed justification. The most significant advantage for Essay B is its identification and discussion of *uncontrolled* variables, demonstrating a mature and realistic understanding of experimental limitations before the experiment is even conducted. Finally, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are more nuanced and specific, addressing not just chemical hazards but also the ethical implications of using food resources for experiments, a consideration that is highly relevant to its topic. While Essay A's procedure is sound and thorough, Essay B's overall approach reflects a higher level of critical thinking, creativity, and methodological rigor.",
