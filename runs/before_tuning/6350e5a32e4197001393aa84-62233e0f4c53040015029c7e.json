  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger exploration of its topic compared to Essay B, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Essay A presents a well-defined, albeit slightly complex, research question: \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\". This is supported by a clear, relevant, and detailed background section explaining dissolved oxygen and the Winkler method, which is highly appropriate for the DP Chemistry level. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is logically structured and easy to follow, and its section on safety, environmental, and ethical considerations is thorough and specific, addressing particular chemicals and proper disposal methods.\n\nConversely, Essay B is significantly weaker in several key areas. Its research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is confusingly phrased and lacks focus. While the background information on buffers is chemically sound, the most significant failing of Essay B is its methodology. The procedure is presented in a non-sequential and illogical order (e.g., step \u2464 precedes step \u2462), making it extremely difficult for another person to replicate the experiment. Additionally, the safety section is woefully inadequate, mentioning only acetic acid while ignoring other significant hazards like sodium hydroxide, and it completely omits any discussion of environmental or ethical considerations. Although Essay B identifies its variables correctly, the fundamental flaws in its procedural design and safety awareness make it a much weaker submission.",
