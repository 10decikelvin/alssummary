  "reasoning": "The provided text is just a single document, not a comparison of two separate essays. It appears to be a well-structured lab report, likely from a high school or early university level chemistry course. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of experimental design, including the importance of a control group, isolating variables, and considering potential sources of error. The language used is appropriate for a scientific report, and the student correctly identifies and explains relevant chemical concepts like chelation and Beer-Lambert's Law.  However, without a second essay to compare it against, I cannot make a relative judgment or declare one better than the other.",
