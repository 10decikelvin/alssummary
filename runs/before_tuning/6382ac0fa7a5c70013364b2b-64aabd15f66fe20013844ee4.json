  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a more robust and complex exploration, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in its sophisticated experimental design, which compares the percentage of calcium carbonate from three different sources using two distinct and appropriate chemical methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition. This comparative approach shows a higher level of critical thinking and experimental planning. The background information provides good personal context and correctly identifies the key chemical reactions for both methods. Furthermore, Essay A's \"Hazards, Concerns and Safety\" section is thorough and well-considered, addressing specific risks like exothermic acid dilution, handling of chemicals like NaOH, and proper environmental disposal of waste, which is a key component of this criterion.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a clear research question and a well-structured methodology, it is fundamentally undermined by a significant chemical flaw. The procedure assumes that titrating orange juice with NaOH will selectively measure only ascorbic acid. However, orange juice contains other acids, such as citric and malic acid, which will also react with the NaOH, leading to a systematic error that invalidates the results. The student does identify this limitation in a table, but it's a flaw that should have been addressed in the initial design phase. Additionally, Essay B's safety section is critically weak; it dismisses the need for gloves and fails to mention eye protection, a standard and necessary precaution for any titration, regardless of the concentration of the base. Essay A's minor error in defining the independent variable is far less significant than the major methodological and safety oversights in Essay B.",
