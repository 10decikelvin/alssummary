  "reasoning": "Both submissions are strong examples of IB Chemistry IAs, demonstrating a clear understanding of the scientific method. Essay A, however, presents a more methodologically sound and analytically complex investigation. Its research question, which aims to determine the activation energy of a reaction, is more sophisticated than the relationship between voltage and mass explored in Essay B. The methodology in Essay A is detailed and demonstrates a good awareness of controlling variables, such as using a water bath for temperature regulation. Furthermore, the safety and disposal considerations in Essay A are more specific and thorough. While Essay B has excellent personal engagement and a well-structured report, its experimental design has some weaknesses, such as using batteries for voltage which can fluctuate, and a less precise method for drying the cathode. Essay B does show excellent critical thinking in identifying the flaking of the zinc deposit as a major limitation. Nevertheless, Essay A's stronger experimental design, deeper theoretical grounding in chemical kinetics, and more complex data analysis (requiring the application of the Arrhenius equation) make it the superior investigation overall.",
