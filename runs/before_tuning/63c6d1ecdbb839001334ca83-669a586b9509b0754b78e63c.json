  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for the Exploration criterion. They both have clear, focused research questions, well-defined variables, and thorough safety considerations.\n\nEssay A's strengths lie in its detailed background information, which includes a specific calculation to justify the concentration of the titrant (KMnO\u2084), demonstrating forethought and a quantitative approach to the experimental design. The \"What was changed\" section is also commendable, as it shows a process of refinement based on preliminary trials, even if not explicitly labeled as such.\n\nHowever, Essay B is slightly superior overall for this criterion. Its structure is exceptionally clear, with numbered sections that logically guide the reader through the experimental plan. The inclusion of a dedicated \"Pre-test\" section is a significant strength, as it explicitly details the pilot experiments and how they informed the final methodology, which is a hallmark of excellent scientific practice. The tables for variables and safety are comprehensive and well-organized, and the inclusion of a labeled diagram of the apparatus adds to the clarity and reproducibility of the method. While Essay A's discussion of error is very strong, that falls more under the Analysis/Evaluation criteria; focusing strictly on the planning and design (Exploration), Essay B's meticulous and well-justified methodology is more robust.\n\nTherefore, due to its more explicit and detailed description of the experimental development process (pre-testing), superior organization, and clearer communication of the setup via a diagram, Essay B is the stronger of the two.",
