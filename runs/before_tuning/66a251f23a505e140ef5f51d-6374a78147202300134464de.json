  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards for Exploration. Essay A is significantly stronger across all assessed components, including the research question, background information, methodology, and consideration of variables and safety.\n\nEssay A presents a sharply focused and sophisticated research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures... on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\". The background information is outstanding, demonstrating a deep understanding by connecting the concept of equilibrium not only to Le Chatelier's principle but also to Gibbs free energy and, most impressively, the Van't Hoff equation. This provides a robust theoretical framework for the investigation. Furthermore, the methodology is meticulous, logically divided into creating a calibration curve and then determining Kc, and it is strengthened by the inclusion of preliminary experiments which informed the final procedure, such as the addition of nitric acid. The handling of variables is exemplary, presented in a detailed table explaining not just how, but *why* each variable is controlled.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is built on a significant conceptual misunderstanding. Its background section confuses thermodynamics (enthalpy change) with kinetics (reaction rate), incorrectly suggesting that higher concentrations increase enthalpy change because of collision theory. This fundamental flaw invalidates the hypothesis and the premise of the entire investigation. The experimental design also contains a critical error; the student states \"I used Zinc as the limiting reactant,\" but calculations based on the stated mass and concentrations reveal that copper (II) sulphate was the limiting reactant. While the procedure itself is a standard calorimetry experiment, the investigation is limited by testing only two concentrations, which is insufficient to establish a meaningful relationship. Finally, the safety considerations in Essay B are generic compared to Essay A's specific and well-researched points, such as the risk of producing cyanide gas.\n\nIn summary, Essay A showcases a well-researched, theoretically sound, and methodologically rigorous investigation characteristic of a high-achieving student. Essay B, despite showing some correct calculations for reaction feasibility, is fundamentally compromised by a core conceptual error and a flawed experimental design, making Essay A the clear winner.",
