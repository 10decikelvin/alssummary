  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger in its demonstration of Criterion B: Exploration. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, clear, and appropriate for an IB Chemistry investigation. The introduction provides an excellent scientific context, outlining the reaction, introducing the Arrhenius equation, and deriving the second-order integrated rate law that forms the theoretical basis for the entire experiment. In contrast, Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased, and its introduction is exceptionally weak, offering only a single generic sentence about titration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its experimental design. It clearly identifies and justifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, showing a thorough understanding of experimental control. The procedure is detailed, logical, and replicable, outlining a sophisticated \"quenching\" and titration method to track reaction progress. Essay A, however, completely fails to state its variables and its methodology is critically incomplete, as it never explains how the independent variable (time relative to the expiration date) will be manipulated or measured. While Essay A has a slightly more detailed risk assessment, Essay B's safety considerations are also appropriate and sufficient. Overall, Essay B presents a well-researched, methodologically sound, and scientifically grounded plan, whereas Essay A lacks the necessary detail, context, and clarity for a successful investigation.",
