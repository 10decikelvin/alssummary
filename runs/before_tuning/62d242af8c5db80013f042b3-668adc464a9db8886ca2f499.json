  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and methodological rigor, making it the stronger of the two.\n\nEssay B's research question is concise and focused, directly leading into a comprehensive background section that is rich with relevant chemical principles. It skillfully integrates concepts like kinetics, Beer-Lambert Law, the chemistry of chromophores, and even the redox reactions for the titration used to standardize the bleach. The inclusion of a \"Pre-Test\" section to determine the initial bleach concentration and the optimal wavelength is a mark of excellent experimental design and foresight. The methodology is clear, logical, and the control variables are well-justified.\n\nEssay A also has many strengths, particularly its very detailed consideration of controlled variables and potential limitations, which are thoughtfully presented in tables with justifications and proposed improvements. The choice of a back-titration method is appropriately complex for this level. However, its research question is somewhat cumbersome, and there is a critical inconsistency between the temperatures listed in the RQ and those in the independent variable table. Furthermore, the explanation of the dependent variable and the titration process lacks the clarity and depth seen in Essay B. While commendable, Essay A's focus on listing many potential errors feels slightly less impactful than Essay B's proactive approach of solving a major methodological problem (unknown bleach concentration) through a preliminary experiment.\n\nOverall, Essay B is superior due to its deeper and more cohesive background information, its more elegant and clearly communicated methodology, and its demonstration of practical problem-solving through the pre-test titration.",
