  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a significantly more sophisticated and rigorous exploration of chemical kinetics. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, quantitative, and directly linked to fundamental chemical principles. The background section is a major strength, as it expertly derives the second-order integrated rate law and links it to the Arrhenius equation, providing a robust theoretical framework that justifies the entire methodology. The variables are clearly defined, and the chosen experimental technique, involving quenching and titration, though complex, is appropriate for determining the rate constant.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating good personal engagement and a clear procedure, is built on a significant conceptual misunderstanding. The dependent variable is confusingly labeled \"Reaction Speed (s)\", which conflates the concept of speed (rate) with the measurement of time. More critically, the student's proposed method of analysis, defining rate as \"\u0394t / \u0394m\", is fundamentally incorrect from a chemical kinetics perspective; rate of reaction must involve a change over time (e.g., \u0394[concentration]/\u0394t), not a change in time per unit mass. While Essay B has a slightly more detailed safety and environmental section, this does not compensate for the foundational flaws in its scientific approach. Essay A\u2019s plan is scientifically sound and demonstrates a much deeper level of understanding required for a high-level chemistry investigation.\n\nIn summary, Essay A is superior due to its excellent research question, strong theoretical foundation, and scientifically valid methodology. Essay B, despite its strengths in procedure and safety considerations, is undermined by a critical conceptual error in its definition and proposed analysis of reaction rate.",
