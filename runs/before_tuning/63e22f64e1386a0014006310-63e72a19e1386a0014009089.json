  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong and well-structured plans for their investigations, clearly aligning with the IB Chemistry IA Criterion B requirements. Essay A proposes a classic calorimetry experiment with a well-defined, two-part research question investigating the effect of carbon chain length and isomerism on the enthalpy of combustion of alcohols. The background information is relevant, the variables are clearly identified and justified, and the procedure is detailed enough to be replicated. Essay B investigates the effect of salinity on dissolved oxygen using the chemically complex Winkler titration method. Its research question is sharply focused and contextually justified with real-world relevance to marine ecosystems. The background section is particularly commendable, providing a detailed explanation of intermolecular forces, the \"salting out\" effect, and the specific redox chemistry of the Winkler method.\n\nWhile both are excellent, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of engagement and chemical sophistication. The choice of the Winkler titration over a simpler DO probe method shows a greater commitment to exploring a challenging chemical technique. The background information is more in-depth, particularly in its explanation of the multi-step titration reactions. Furthermore, Essay B's safety section is more thorough, addressing the specific hazards of multiple chemicals, whereas Essay A's is slightly more generic. Although Essay A's research question is ambitious with two parts, Essay B's deep dive into a single, complex relationship with a sophisticated methodology ultimately presents a more impressive and well-considered experimental plan.",
