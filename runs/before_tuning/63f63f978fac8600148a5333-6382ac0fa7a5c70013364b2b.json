  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is as follows:\n\nEssay A presents a significantly more rigorous and well-developed exploration than Essay B. Its research question is highly focused and specific: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". This precision is mirrored in its background section, which provides a detailed, literature-supported rationale for every key decision, most notably the choice of an acidic pH range to avoid the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082. The methodology is further strengthened by the inclusion of preliminary trials, which were used to justify critical parameters like the adsorption time and the final pH range, demonstrating a sophisticated and iterative approach to experimental design. The identification and explanation of controlled variables in Essay A are exceptionally thorough, linking each variable back to specific chemical principles (e.g., temperature's effect on water autoionization and pectin stability).\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's exploration is weaker in several key areas. The research question is broader, comparing two methods across three samples, which diffuses its focus. The scientific background is superficial, providing only the main chemical equations without explaining the underlying principles, such as why back titration is necessary or the kinetics of thermal decomposition. Most critically, the methodology contains fundamental procedural flaws that undermine its validity. For example, it specifies using a measuring cylinder to measure volumes of key reagents for a titration (\"50 cm\u00b3 of 2.0 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl was added... using a measuring cylinder\"), a technique wholly inappropriate for precise analytical chemistry. Similarly, the plan to heat samples for a fixed \"3 minutes\" with a Bunsen burner for thermal decomposition is flawed, as the student later admits this is insufficient to achieve the required temperature for complete decomposition, a fact that should have informed the initial design. While Essay B has a solid safety section and clear personal motivation, these strengths do not compensate for the significant weaknesses in its scientific rigor and experimental planning.\n\nUltimately, Essay A demonstrates a much deeper understanding of the scientific context, meticulous planning, and a proactive approach to addressing potential experimental limitations, making it a superior example of Criterion B.",
