  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to the exploration criterion. Its research question is multifaceted and investigates a clear chemical relationship: \"What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion\" and \"What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\". This is a far more sophisticated and scientifically rigorous inquiry than Essay B's question, which is a simple brand comparison (\"Which of the 5 processed orange juice brands... has the least concentration of Ascorbic acid\"). Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is sound and appropriate for its research question, with an excellent, detailed table of controlled variables that explains both *why* and *how* each is controlled. The safety section in Essay A is also comprehensive, identifying specific risks and providing clear mitigation strategies.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's methodology contains a fundamental chemical flaw. It proposes using an acid-base titration with NaOH to determine the concentration of ascorbic acid in orange juice. However, as the student later notes in their limitations, \"orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH\". This flaw invalidates the entire premise of the experiment, as the titration would measure total acidity, not specifically ascorbic acid concentration. While it's good the student recognized this, for Criterion B, the design itself is what is assessed, and this design is not fit for purpose. Additionally, Essay B's safety section is weak and dismissive, stating \"Gloves are not necessary... No other special safety precautions are required,\" which is poor practice. Overall, Essay A presents a well-researched, methodologically sound, and safe investigation, whereas Essay B's exploration is built on a critical chemical misunderstanding.",
