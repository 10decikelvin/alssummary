  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to Criterion B (Exploration) than Essay B. The research question for Essay A, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is focused and appropriately complex for the IB level. Its background information is excellent, providing not only the context for vitamin C degradation but also a detailed chemical explanation of the redox titration method used for analysis, including balanced equations. The methodology is logical, detailed enough for replication, and includes appropriate controls and multiple trials. Crucially, the controlled variables, such as \"Temperature Of Water Bath\" and \"Concentration of Iodine Solution,\" are well-chosen and justified.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question and relevant background on freezing point depression, contains a fundamental flaw in its experimental design. The background correctly identifies that the number of ions (related to moles and the Van't Hoff factor) is the key factor in freezing point depression. However, the methodology then controls for the *mass* of the salts (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\"). This is a critical error, as equal masses of salts with different molar masses (e.g., NaCl vs. CaCl\u2082) will contain different numbers of moles and thus a different number of ions, making the comparison scientifically invalid. Furthermore, Essay B fails to control for the initial mass or surface area of the ice cubes and completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major oversight for this criterion. Essay A's procedure is robust and its risk assessment is specific and relevant, making it a much more thorough and scientifically sound exploration.",
