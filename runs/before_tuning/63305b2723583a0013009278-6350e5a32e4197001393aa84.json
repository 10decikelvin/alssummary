  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more focused and well-designed investigation. Its research question is clear, specific, and testable, identifying a single independent variable (voltage) and a measurable dependent variable (mass of zinc deposited), while explicitly stating constants. The background information provides a strong theoretical basis, directly linking Faraday's laws of electrolysis to the hypothesis. The methodology is detailed, logical, and repeatable, with a comprehensive list of controlled variables and how they will be managed. In contrast, Essay B's research question is less focused, attempting to investigate two independent variables simultaneously (salt concentration and water source), which complicates the experimental design and potential analysis. While its background on the Winkler method is good, the procedure is less clear about the range of concentrations being tested and conflates the primary investigation with a comparison of measurement techniques (Winkler vs. probe). Essay A's evaluation of limitations and suggestions for improvement is also more specific and insightful. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a superior understanding of scientific investigation design and execution, making it the better of the two.",
