  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more sophisticated exploration of its research topic compared to Essay A. The research question in Essay B, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is exceptionally well-defined, specifying not just the variables but also the context and analytical technique. Essay B's background information is its standout feature, providing a deep, chemically-reasoned justification for the investigation by explaining the role of functional groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl) in biosorption, the mechanism of ion exchange, and the effect of pH on the protonation of these sites based on Le Chatelier's Principle. This contrasts sharply with Essay A, which, while having a clear research question, fails to provide a convincing chemical rationale for why sodium bicarbonate concentration would specifically affect the Young's Modulus of the bioplastic.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is thoughtfully developed, as evidenced by the detailed \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which justifies the chosen pH range (to avoid precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082) and the adsorption time. This demonstrates a thorough and iterative experimental design process. While Essay A presents a very detailed and reproducible procedure with excellent use of technology like Tracker, it lacks the scientific depth in its justification. Both essays excel in defining variables and considering safety. However, Essay A's ethical consideration about using food materials is a nice touch. Despite this, Essay B's superior scientific context, clear chemical link between variables, and justification of its methodology through preliminary work make it the clear winner for Criterion B.",
