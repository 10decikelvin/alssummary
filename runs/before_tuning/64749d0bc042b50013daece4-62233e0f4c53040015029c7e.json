  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-formulated, clearly stating both independent variables (salinity and temperature) with specific ranges and uncertainties, the dependent variable, and the precise analytical method (\"...measured through Winkler's titration\"). In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is awkwardly phrased and lacks clarity on its primary focus (buffer capacity).\n\nFurthermore, the background and rationale in Essay A are outstanding, demonstrating strong personal engagement linked to a significant global issue (\"effects of global warming on marine organisms\") and supporting its hypothesis with both chemical theory (dipole-induced dipole interactions) and literature graphs. Essay B's rationale is superficial (\"I learned about the Buffer solution in my Chemistry class\") and its background explanations are less developed. The methodology is another area of stark contrast; Essay A presents a logical, detailed, and replicable procedure with a comprehensive table of controlled variables that explains both *why* and *how* each is controlled. Conversely, Essay B's procedure is chaotically organized (e.g., step \u2464 \"Set up the burette\" appears before step \u2462 \"Prepare NaOH solution\") and its control of variables is less thorough. Finally, Essay A includes an excellent, detailed safety table covering specific hazards and disposal methods for all chemicals, while Essay B's safety section is dangerously incomplete, only mentioning one chemical hazard briefly and omitting others entirely.",
