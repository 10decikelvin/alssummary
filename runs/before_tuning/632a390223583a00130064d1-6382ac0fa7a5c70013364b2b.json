  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly more thorough and well-developed exploration (Criterion B) than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate...affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is highly focused and sets up a clear, quantifiable investigation. Its background information is comprehensive, defining key concepts like Young's Modulus with relevant equations and explaining the chemistry of bioplastics and plasticizers. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the investigation. In contrast, while Essay B's research question is also clear, its background is more superficial and serves more as a personal justification than a deep scientific context.\n\nThe methodology is where Essay A truly excels. It provides a meticulous, step-by-step procedure that is easily replicable, specifying exact quantities and the uncertainties of measuring instruments (e.g., \"15.00g \u00b1 0.01g of Cornstarch\"). The integration of technology like Vernier LabQuest and Tracker software for precise data collection shows a sophisticated approach. Essay B's methodology contains procedural weaknesses, such as using a measuring cylinder instead of a pipette for measuring an aliquot for titration (\"25 cm\u00b3...was added to another conical flask...using a measuring cylinder\"), which introduces significant error. Furthermore, its method for thermal decomposition is contradictory, first stating to heat for \"3 minutes\" and later to heat \"until a constant mass was obtained.\"\n\nEssay A's treatment of variables is exemplary. It correctly identifies all variables and presents controlled variables in a detailed table explaining not just how they will be controlled but also *why* it is important. The inclusion of a section on \"Uncontrolled Variables\" demonstrates a high level of critical thinking about the experimental design's limitations. Essay B, however, incorrectly identifies the \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable when it is the *source* of the sample (chalk, seashells, etc.). The control methods described are also less rigorous (e.g., using the \"same Bunsen Burner\" to control temperature is a weak control).\n\nFinally, both essays have good safety considerations. However, Essay A also includes a thoughtful discussion of environmental and ethical considerations, such as the disposal of the bioplastic and the \"use of edible materials,\" which adds another layer of depth to the exploration. For these reasons, Essay A is substantially stronger across all aspects of Criterion B.",
