  "reasoning": "Essay A is better as it provides a complete and well-structured plan for an investigation, fully addressing all components of Criterion B. The research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is focused and appropriately complex. Essay A includes relevant background information on both BOD and the Winkler method, a detailed step-by-step methodology, a comprehensive table of controlled variables, and a thorough safety assessment. While the method for controlling temperature could be more precise than a \"dark cupboard,\" the overall experimental design is sound and replicable.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while starting strongly with excellent personal engagement and sophisticated background information linking vitamin C degradation to kinetic theory, is critically incomplete. The provided text is missing the entire variables table (beyond the headers), the methodology section, and any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. These omissions are fundamental to Criterion B, which assesses the quality of the entire experimental plan. Without a methodology or a defined set of variables, it is impossible to evaluate the scientific validity or rigor of the proposed investigation. Therefore, despite its promising introduction, Essay B fails to meet the basic requirements of the Exploration criterion, making Essay A the superior submission.",
