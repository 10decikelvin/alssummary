  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger in its demonstration of Criterion B: Exploration. Its research questions (\"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\" and \"Does the number of carbon atoms... affect its boiling point?\") are focused, clear, and directly addressed by a well-planned database investigation. Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased and reads more like a statement of method: \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation...\". Furthermore, Essay B provides extensive and highly relevant background information, establishing a clear scientific context by discussing homologous series, intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds, London forces), and the principles of combustion, all linked to a compelling real-world application of finding sustainable fuels. In stark contrast, Essay A's introduction is a single, generic sentence: \"Titration is a technique used in analytical chemistry...\". Essay B excels in its methodology, explicitly identifying the independent (number of carbons), dependent (enthalpy, boiling point), and controlled variables (\"only linear primary alcohols\"), and justifying its choice of reliable databases (NIST, HSDB). Essay A's methodology is a procedural list that crucially omits how the independent variable (expiration date) will be varied and controlled, and it fails to explicitly define its variables. While Essay A does include a competent risk assessment, which is a required component for a lab-based investigation, Essay B's entire exploration is framed by significant environmental considerations, making it highly relevant. Overall, Essay B presents a thoroughly researched, well-structured, and scientifically justified plan, whereas Essay A presents an incomplete and context-lacking outline.",
