  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of Criterion B compared to Essay A. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its clear and accurate identification of variables and a robust methodology for a database investigation. It correctly identifies the \"number of carbons in a chain\" as the independent variable and explains how controlling for isomers (\"only linear primary alcohols\") is crucial for a fair test. In contrast, Essay A fundamentally misidentifies its independent variable as the \"Mass of sample,\" which is actually a controlled variable; the true independent variable is the source of the calcium carbonate. Essay B also provides a significantly more detailed and scientifically relevant background, thoroughly explaining the concepts of intermolecular forces and enthalpy of combustion that underpin its research questions. While Essay A's hands-on experimental approach is valid, its methodology contains notable weaknesses, such as using a measuring cylinder for a precise volume transfer where a pipette is required and providing contradictory instructions for the heating process. Essay A does have a well-considered safety section, which is a strength for a lab-based investigation, but this does not outweigh the fundamental flaws in its experimental design and variable identification. Essay B\u2019s exploration is more focused, scientifically sound, and demonstrates a higher level of understanding of how to conduct a controlled scientific inquiry.",
