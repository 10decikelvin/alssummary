  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality work for Criterion B, but Essay B demonstrates a superior level of scientific exploration and personal engagement. Essay A is very strong, with a clear research question, well-justified variables, and a meticulous, repeatable procedure. Its background information on electroplating is thorough and directly linked to the hypothesis, and its safety and environmental considerations are specific and well-considered. However, Essay B distinguishes itself through its sophisticated methodology and the explicit inclusion of a \"Development and pilot studies\" section. This section details how the student systematically overcame significant experimental challenges, such as removing tablet binders and preventing precipitation by forming micelles. This demonstrates a high level of critical thinking, problem-solving, and personal input in the design process. Furthermore, Essay B's background delves into more complex chemical principles like crystal field theory and micelle formation to justify its analytical technique, showcasing a deeper engagement with advanced chemical concepts. While Essay A executes a standard experiment exceptionally well, Essay B's ambition, demonstrated problem-solving, and integration of complex theory make its exploration more impressive.",
