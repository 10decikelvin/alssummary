  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards, which assess the research question, background, methodology, variables, and safety considerations.\n\nEssay B is demonstrably superior across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is focused, precise, and establishes clear parameters. This is followed by an extensive and well-researched background section that connects personal interest to scientific principles, explains the theory of electrolysis with relevant chemical equations, and cites previous studies to contextualize the investigation. The methodology is exceptionally detailed and logical, including a complete apparatus list with uncertainties, a step-by-step procedure that is easily replicable, and a thorough, justified breakdown of the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Furthermore, its safety, environmental, and ethical considerations are comprehensive and specific.\n\nIn stark contrast, Essay A is significantly underdeveloped and lacks coherence. The research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is awkwardly phrased, starting with the method rather than the scientific query. The background information is virtually non-existent, offering only a single generic sentence about titration. The methodology provided is incomplete, starting midway through the procedure and omitting the critical milk sample preparation steps. Essay A also fails to explicitly define and discuss the control of variables, a crucial component of experimental design. While it includes a basic risk assessment, it pales in comparison to the detailed and thoughtful considerations presented in Essay B.\n\nIn summary, Essay B presents a thoroughly planned, well-justified, and scientifically grounded exploration that meets the highest standards of Criterion B. Essay A, on the other hand, appears to be an incomplete draft with major deficiencies in its background, methodology, and discussion of variables, making it a much weaker submission.",
