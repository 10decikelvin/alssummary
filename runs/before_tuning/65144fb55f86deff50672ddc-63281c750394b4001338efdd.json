  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B criteria. The research question in Essay A, \"How does an increase in ionic radii...of central metal ions...affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting...of color complexes,\" is highly focused, complex, and shows a sophisticated understanding of IB Chemistry topics. In contrast, Essay B's question about the specific heat capacity of a KNO\u2083 solution is a standard and less complex investigation. Essay A provides extensive, relevant background information, thoroughly explaining d-orbital splitting theory, ligand exchange reactions, and the function of a spectrophotometer, which provides a strong scientific context. Essay B's background is adequate but far less detailed, offering a basic definition of specific heat capacity.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its identification and control of variables, presenting a clear table with strong justifications for controlling factors like ligand type, concentration, and complex geometry. Essay B's controlled variables are simpler and less comprehensive. The methodology in Essay A, using spectrophotometry, is more precise and appropriate for its research question than the calorimetry method in Essay B, which is notoriously prone to significant systematic errors from heat loss. Finally, Essay A\u2019s safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are specific and well-considered, addressing chemical hazards and aquatic toxicity, whereas Essay B's are generic and underdeveloped, particularly the dismissive ethical consideration.",
