  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-focused and clearly outlines the independent and dependent variables, the substance being tested, and the specific analytical technique (\"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at... affect its calcium content... by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\"). In contrast, Essay A's research question is framed as a less sophisticated \"Is it possible...\" question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is detailed, logical, and includes a justification for choosing complexometric titration over other methods, showcasing genuine engagement and preliminary research. The variables are not only correctly identified but are presented in comprehensive tables that explain *how* they will be controlled and *why* this control is necessary. Essay A, on the other hand, fundamentally misidentifies its independent and dependent variables, a critical flaw in experimental design. While Essay A's background on thermochemistry is adequate, Essay B's background on EDTA titration is more specifically tailored to its procedure. Finally, Essay B's treatment of safety and environmental concerns is more thorough, explaining the reasoning behind each precaution, and even proactively identifies limitations of the proposed method.",
