  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration of its research topic. The research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction,\" is original and demonstrates a high level of personal engagement and scientific curiosity by identifying a gap in existing literature regarding real versus model foods. The background information is thorough, delving into the specific chemistry of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) and justifying the chosen analytical method (colorimetry) by explaining the Beer-Lambert Law and the specific wavelength required. In contrast, Essay B's topic, titrating orange juice to find ascorbic acid concentration, is a very standard experiment with a less sophisticated scientific premise. While Essay B provides adequate background on ascorbic acid, it lacks the depth of research shown in Essay A.\n\nThe most critical distinction lies in the appropriateness of the methodology. Essay A's method of baking bread and then extracting and measuring AGEs via a colorimeter is a scientifically sound, albeit challenging, approach to its research question. Essay B's chosen methodology, an acid-base titration with NaOH, is fundamentally flawed. The student correctly identifies this flaw in their limitations table, stating, \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid.\" This means the chosen method cannot answer the research question, as it does not selectively measure ascorbic acid. Acknowledging a fatal flaw does not compensate for choosing an inappropriate method during the exploration and design phase. Both essays present their variables and safety considerations clearly, but the superior scientific rigor, originality, and method-validity of Essay A make it the better submission for Criterion B.",
