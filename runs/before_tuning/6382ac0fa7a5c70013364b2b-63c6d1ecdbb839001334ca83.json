  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for a scientific investigation. Essay A is well-structured, clearly outlining two different methodologies (titration and thermal decomposition) to compare the calcium carbonate content in various samples. It provides good background, identifies variables, and includes a solid section on safety. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of personal engagement and scientific thinking. The background information in Essay B is more thorough, justifying the choice of concentration for the titrant with a calculation. The methodology section in Essay B is more detailed, notably mentioning how preliminary trials informed the final experimental design, which is a sign of an excellent investigative process. Most significantly, the evaluation of weaknesses in Essay B is superior. It identifies a wider range of specific potential errors (both random and systematic), explains their impact on the results with chemical reasoning, and proposes concrete, intelligent improvements, such as using a colorimeter or standardizing the titrant. While Essay A's evaluation is good, especially in identifying the temperature limitation of the Bunsen burner, Essay B's analysis is more comprehensive and demonstrates a deeper understanding of experimental design and error analysis.",
