  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question is highly specific and focused, clearly outlining the independent variable (temperature with defined levels), the dependent variable (calcium content), and the sophisticated analytical technique (EDTA complexometric titration). The background information is comprehensive, linking biological context (calcium's importance) to complex chemical principles, including solubility changes and the detailed mechanism of complexometric titration with relevant equations. Essay B's methodology is exceptionally thorough, precise, and reproducible, with specific quantities and concentrations provided. The inclusion of a \"Comparison of Method\" section, justifying the choice of titration over other techniques, showcases exemplary scientific thinking. Furthermore, its discussion of variables is exhaustive, presented in clear tables that not only identify controlled variables but also meticulously explain why and how they must be controlled. The safety and environmental considerations are specific and relevant to the chemicals and procedures used (e.g., handling ammonia in a fume cupboard, minimizing food waste), far surpassing the generic points made in Essay A.\n\nWhile Essay A presents a viable investigation, it is comparatively weaker across all aspects. Its research question is clear but simpler. The methodology lacks crucial details, such as the specific concentrations of KNO\u2083 to be tested, making it difficult to replicate. Essay A also misidentifies the dependent variable as \"temperature difference\" rather than the calculated \"specific heat capacity.\" The safety precautions are generic and not tailored to the specific risks of the experiment. Although Essay A provides adequate background information, it does not achieve the depth or chemical complexity demonstrated in Essay B. Therefore, Essay B's meticulous planning, detailed justification, and deeper scientific engagement make it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
