  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much more robust and scientifically sound exploration of its research question. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its impeccable methodology, which is directly supported by a thorough and relevant scientific background. The student justifies the choice of an acidic pH range by referencing the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082, stating \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4... Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" This demonstrates a high level of chemical understanding. Furthermore, the inclusion of detailed preliminary trials to determine optimal contact time and refine the pH range showcases genuine scientific inquiry and thoughtful experimental design. The control of variables is also exemplary, with clear justifications for each.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is built upon a fundamentally flawed methodology. The research question proposes using Beer-Lambert's Law to determine the solubility of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO\u2084), a colorless salt. The student selects a wavelength of 210 nm, deep in the UV spectrum, where many species, including the chloride ions from the independent variable (MgCl\u2082), absorb light. This choice of analytical technique is inappropriate and makes it impossible to isolate the absorbance of CaSO\u2084, invalidating the entire experiment. The procedure also reveals a conceptual misunderstanding of solubility, as it describes making a \"stock solution of 0.6M CaSO4\" when the actual solubility is far lower (~0.015 M). While Essay B has a clear real-world rationale related to fertilizers, its procedural and theoretical weaknesses are critical.\n\nEssay A's background is also superior, providing detailed explanations of biosorption mechanisms and the relevant functional groups in orange peels, complete with chemical structures. Essay B's explanation of the diverse ion effect is adequate, but it fails to justify the flawed analytical technique. Ultimately, Essay A presents a well-conceived, carefully planned, and methodologically sound investigation, whereas Essay B's promising research question is undermined by a critical methodological error.",
