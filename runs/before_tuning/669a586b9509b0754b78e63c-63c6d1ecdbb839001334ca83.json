  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a strong understanding of the scientific method and have clearly structured their investigation plans. Essay A is commendable for its clear, step-by-step methodology, which includes a diagram of the apparatus and a detailed table of controlled variables with justifications. The inclusion of preliminary test results to refine the independent variable's range shows good experimental design. Essay B also presents a well-structured and detailed plan. Its strengths lie in the excellent contextual background provided, linking the experiment to a real-world application (anemia treatment), and the justification for the concentration of the titrant used, which demonstrates a high level of forethought and chemical understanding.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a slightly superior depth of investigation and critical thinking. The variable control table in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, explicitly stating how each variable will be controlled and why it's important. The \"Evaluation\" section in Essay B is significantly more thorough, identifying multiple specific sources of both random and systematic error, explaining their potential impact on the results, and proposing concrete, viable improvements (e.g., using a colorimeter, standardizing the KMnO\u2084). This level of reflection and foresight into potential experimental limitations is a hallmark of a stronger investigation. While Essay A also identifies errors, they are slightly more general, and the suggested improvements are less sophisticated. Therefore, Essay B presents a more robust and critically evaluated experimental design.",
