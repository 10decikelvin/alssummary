  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong and viable investigations. Essay B has a very clear and well-structured research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", which is well-supported by relevant background theory on BOD and the Winkler titration chemistry. Its methodology is sound and its identification of variables is clear.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a superior level of engagement with the experimental design, a key component of Criterion B. While its research question is a bit long-winded, it is highly focused. Essay A's strength lies in its meticulous attention to detail. The \"Comparison of Method\" section provides a thoughtful justification for choosing complexometric titration over other advanced techniques like FAAS, showing genuine consideration of the school laboratory context. Furthermore, its table of controlled variables is exhaustive, explaining not just what will be controlled but *why* it is important. Most impressively, Essay A includes a detailed table of limitations, categorizing them into procedural issues, random errors, and systematic errors, and proposes specific, intelligent improvements for each. This level of critical reflection on the proposed methodology is a hallmark of an outstanding Exploration section and is absent in Essay B. While Essay B is competent, Essay A's depth in planning, justification, and self-evaluation makes it the stronger submission for this criterion.",
