  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach to the exploration of its research question. The background information is a key strength, providing a sophisticated theoretical framework that links the equilibrium constant (Kc) not only to Le Chatelier's principle but also to Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation, showcasing a deep conceptual understanding. The inclusion and detailed discussion of preliminary experiments are exemplary, as they demonstrate a proactive approach to identifying and solving potential procedural issues, such as the absorbance of reactant solutions and the time required to reach equilibrium. This level of preparatory work ensures the final methodology is robust and well-justified. Furthermore, Essay B's variables are clearly identified with concise, scientifically sound justifications for why each must be controlled.\n\nEssay A, while having a clear structure and a personally engaging introduction, suffers from some significant weaknesses. The research question itself contains inconsistencies regarding the temperatures to be tested, which are different in the title, the formal RQ, and the variables table. The explanation of the back-titration chemistry is confusing and potentially inaccurate, suggesting a less secure grasp of the underlying principles. Although the table of controlled variables is extensive and the separate \"Limitations\" section shows good reflective thinking, the core methodology fails to address a critical issue: the potential precipitation of milk proteins upon heating, which would directly affect the concentration of soluble calcium and thus invalidate the results.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay B is superior due to its depth of scientific understanding, the meticulous planning evidenced by its preliminary work, and a clear, coherent, and robust experimental design. Essay A's plan has potential conceptual and procedural flaws that undermine the validity of the proposed investigation, despite its commendable attempt at thoroughness in other sections.",
