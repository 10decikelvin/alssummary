  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is as follows:\n\nEssay B demonstrates a much stronger and more coherent approach to Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is focused, clear, and perfectly suited for a school laboratory investigation. The methodology is well-designed and appropriate, utilizing electrical heating (Q=VIt) for precise energy input and a calorimeter to minimize heat loss. Critically, Essay B correctly identifies the independent (concentration), dependent (temperature difference/specific heat capacity), and controlled variables, presenting the latter in a clear table with justification. This showcases a solid understanding of experimental design.\n\nConversely, while Essay A tackles a more ambitious and theoretically complex topic, its exploration is fundamentally flawed. The research question is awkwardly phrased as a yes/no question, and more importantly, the student fails to anticipate the extremely small temperature changes involved, rendering the proposed methodology impractical with standard equipment. The most significant weakness lies in the \"Variables\" section, where the independent and dependent variables are completely swapped and incorrectly defined (\"Independent: Temperature change\", \"Dependent: Different types of substances\"). This represents a critical misunderstanding of experimental principles. Although Essay A has a detailed background section, its poor experimental design and fundamental errors in identifying variables make Essay B superior in demonstrating the qualities required for the Exploration criterion.\n\nIn summary, Essay B presents a well-planned, logical, and methodologically sound investigation, while Essay A's ambition is undermined by a flawed experimental plan and a critical lack of understanding regarding variables.",
