  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact temperatures and uncertainties. The background context is both scientifically rich and personally engaging, effectively linking the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction to complex natural phenomena like cardiac arrhythmia and thoroughly explaining the underlying chemical principles such as reaction rates and autocatalysis. The most outstanding feature of Essay A is the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which details the student's iterative process of selecting equipment, from simple observation to using a colorimeter and finally a lux sensor, demonstrating genuine exploration and problem-solving. Furthermore, its treatment of safety and environmental considerations is exemplary; it not only identifies specific chemical hazards and mitigation strategies but also explicitly discusses reducing the experiment's scale to minimize environmental impact.\n\nEssay B presents a competent investigation with a clear research question and a scientifically sound background on the \"salting in\" effect. The methodology is logical, employing a spectrophotometer and a calibration curve to determine solubility, and the controlled variables are well-identified. However, it lacks the depth of Essay A. The methodology section does not show a similar level of developmental thinking or personal input in refining the procedure. More significantly, its \"Safety precautions\" section is brief and somewhat general, and it completely omits any discussion of environmental impact or waste disposal, which is a critical component of this criterion. While Essay B is a solid effort, Essay A's detailed justification of its methodological choices and its comprehensive approach to safety and environmental ethics showcase a higher level of scientific inquiry and awareness.",
