  "reasoning": "Both submissions present well-structured and detailed explorations for their respective investigations. Essay A provides a clear and focused research question, a solid background on the \"salting out\" effect, and a well-defined set of variables. The procedure is logical and easy to follow. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of personal engagement, scientific rigor, and complexity. Its research question, which aims to determine the activation energy of a reaction, is more ambitious. The background section in Essay B is exceptionally thorough, linking concepts from kinetics like reaction mechanisms, the rate law, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation in a coherent narrative. Crucially, Essay B includes a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies the choices made in the final methodology (e.g., the temperature range, the decision not to use cuvette caps). This demonstrates a more iterative and refined experimental design process, which is a hallmark of a stronger exploration. While both essays have good safety tables, Essay B's is slightly more detailed and specific in its risk mitigation strategies. Overall, Essay B's comprehensive background, justification of methodological choices through preliminary work, and more complex research question make it the superior example for Criterion B.",
