  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its more focused research question, stronger justification for its methodology, and clearer demonstration of personal engagement in the experimental design process. Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined, precisely stating the independent variable (temperature), the dependent variable (initial rate of reaction), the method of measurement (colorimeter), and the final goal (calculating activation energy). In contrast, Essay A's research question is broader and relies on correlating experimentally determined values with manufacturer's data, which introduces a significant uncontrolled variable.\n\nEssay B's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which explicitly details how initial trials informed and refined the final procedure, such as setting the temperature range and modifying the sample handling technique. This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative scientific process. While Essay A has a very thorough list of controlled variables, Essay B's justification for controlling its variables is more explicitly linked to the underlying principles of chemical kinetics.\n\nEssay A does have a very comprehensive background section with excellent detail on the complex chemistry of milk. However, Essay B's background is more effective because every concept introduced\u2014from the Beer-Lambert law to the Arrhenius equation\u2014directly serves to explain and justify the chosen experimental design. Both essays have excellent and detailed risk assessments. Overall, Essay B presents a more cohesive, well-planned, and scientifically rigorous investigation.",
