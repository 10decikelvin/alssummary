  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, making this a close comparison. Essay A is marginally superior due to the depth of its scientific exploration and the sophistication of its experimental design. The rationale for Essay A's research question is exceptionally strong, justifying the acidic pH range not just out of interest, but based on a clear understanding of copper (II) hydroxide's solubility product (Ksp) to avoid precipitation: \"copper (II) undergoes precipitation at around pH 5.4... Therefore, the pH range I would be working with has to be below the pH of which precipitation takes place.\" This demonstrates a proactive approach to potential methodological issues. Furthermore, the inclusion of detailed preliminary trials to determine contact time and refine the procedure (e.g., deciding to use centrifugation) showcases an iterative and thoughtful design process. While Essay B's methodology is also excellent and its safety/environmental section is more detailed, Essay A's investigation into the complex mechanism of biosorption, supported by detailed background on pectin, cellulose, and chelation, represents a more advanced and thorough scientific exploration. Essay B's topic of electroplating is more standard, and while executed very well, it doesn't display the same level of independent problem-solving in the design phase as Essay A.",
