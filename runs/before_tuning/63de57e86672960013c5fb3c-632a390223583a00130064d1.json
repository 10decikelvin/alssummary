  "reasoning": "Both essays present high-quality Criterion B sections, demonstrating strong understanding of experimental design. Essay A is slightly superior due to its more cohesive and well-justified scientific context. It provides a clear personal motivation (jewellery making) and links it directly to the principles of electroplating. Crucially, the background section thoroughly explains the underlying chemistry, including redox reactions and Faraday's first law, to build a solid theoretical foundation for the hypothesis: \"Increasing the voltage means that the increased current will withdraw electrons from and pump more electrons to the cell. Hence, more ions will be oxidized and reduced at the anode and cathode respectively...this increases the rate of deposition of copper ions which in turn increases the mass of cathode.\" This creates a seamless connection between theory and the proposed investigation. The methodology is detailed, replicable, and the control of variables is excellent, with clear justifications for why each variable (surface area, concentration, distance) matters.\n\nEssay B is also very strong, with an ambitious and complex experimental design involving the synthesis of bioplastics and the measurement of a physical property (Young's Modulus). The methodology is exceptionally detailed, leveraging technology like the LabQuest 2 and Tracker software to enhance accuracy. The use of tables to clearly delineate controlled and, notably, uncontrolled variables is exemplary and shows a high level of critical thought. However, a minor weakness is that the background research, while comprehensive on the topics of bioplastics and Young's Modulus, does not provide a clear chemical explanation or theoretical basis for *why* sodium bicarbonate concentration would affect the material's elasticity. This leaves a small gap in the scientific context, making the hypothesis feel slightly less grounded in established theory compared to Essay A.\n\nUltimately, while both are excellent, Essay A's tighter integration of background theory with its research question and methodology makes it the marginally better example of scientific exploration.",
