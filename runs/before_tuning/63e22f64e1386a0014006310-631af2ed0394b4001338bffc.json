  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B. However, Essay B is superior due to its greater depth, originality, and display of scientific thinking.\n\nEssay A presents a classic, well-structured investigation into the enthalpy of combustion of alcohols. Its research question is clear and focused, the methodology is detailed and replicable, and the variables are meticulously controlled and justified. The safety considerations are appropriate and well-presented. While this represents a very competent and high-scoring approach, it follows a standard experimental template common in the IB curriculum.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, demonstrates a higher level of intellectual initiative and personal engagement. The research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is more novel and is justified by identifying a specific gap in the scientific literature, supported by citations. The background section is exceptionally detailed, delving into complex biochemistry like casein micelles and chelation equilibria, which is far beyond typical syllabus content. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is not only well-controlled but also shows superior foresight by explicitly identifying and discussing \"Uncontrolled variables\" such as milk fortification. This level of critical thought at the planning stage is a hallmark of an outstanding exploration. Finally, its safety and environmental considerations are more nuanced, including thoughts on chemical disposal and even product packaging.\n\nIn summary, while Essay A is an excellent example of a well-executed standard investigation, Essay B showcases a more authentic and sophisticated scientific inquiry, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
