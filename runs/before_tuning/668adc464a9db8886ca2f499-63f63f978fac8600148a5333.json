  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of understanding and execution for Criterion B. Essay A presents a well-structured and classic kinetics investigation. Its strengths lie in the clear personal motivation, the thorough background on reaction rates and spectrophotometry, and the commendable preliminary work to determine the unknown bleach concentration via titration. The methodology is clear and the variables are well-defined. However, Essay B is superior due to its greater complexity, originality, and depth of critical thinking. The research question addresses a relevant environmental issue (biosorption of heavy metals) and shows a sophisticated understanding of chemistry, such as explaining why a specific acidic pH range was chosen to avoid precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide. The methodology is exceptionally detailed and rigorous, incorporating steps like creating a calibration curve and using a centrifuge to remove interferences, which demonstrates advanced problem-solving. Furthermore, Essay B's identification and control of nuanced variables, such as the brand of oranges and shaking speed, and its insightful self-evaluation of subtle systematic errors (like the potential shift in \u03bbmax with pH), elevate it to a higher standard of scientific inquiry. While Essay A is excellent, Essay B displays a more profound and comprehensive engagement with the scientific process from conception through to evaluation.",
