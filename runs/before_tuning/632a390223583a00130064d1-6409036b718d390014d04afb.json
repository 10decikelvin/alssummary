  "reasoning": "Both essays present exceptionally strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating thorough planning and a deep understanding of the scientific process. Essay A is commendable for its well-defined research question, detailed background on material science concepts like Young's Modulus, and an extremely comprehensive list of controlled and uncontrolled variables. Its method is meticulous, reproducible, and thoughtfully considers safety, environmental, and even ethical aspects, such as the use of food products.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of scientific exploration and engagement. Its introduction is particularly strong, establishing a compelling real-world context by linking the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction to cardiac arrhythmia. The standout feature is the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, where the student explicitly details the iterative process of developing their methodology, explaining the rationale for moving from visual observation to a colorimeter and finally to a lux sensor. This showcases authentic engagement and problem-solving. Furthermore, the background section provides a robust theoretical foundation, linking the experiment to core chemical principles like collision theory and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. While both essays are excellent, Essay B's detailed justification of its methodological evolution gives it a slight edge in demonstrating the \"Exploration\" criterion.",
