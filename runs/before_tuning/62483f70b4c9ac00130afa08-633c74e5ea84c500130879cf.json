  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration of its research topic compared to Essay B, excelling in nearly every aspect of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is highly focused and shows excellent personal engagement. The background section is comprehensive, linking the topic to a contemporary environmental issue (global warming) and thoroughly explaining the underlying chemistry with Le Chatelier's Principle and a comparison of different analytical methods, which masterfully justifies the chosen procedure. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is robust, with clearly defined variables, a detailed step-by-step procedure refined by preliminary trials, and an exemplary risk assessment that addresses specific chemical hazards, necessary precautions, and environmental disposal.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's exploration is weaker and less developed. The research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously, making it less focused. The background research is superficial, defining solubility but failing to delve into the detailed chemical principles (like lattice and hydration enthalpies) that govern the observed phenomena. The section on variables is particularly weak and confusing, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and muddling the relationship between solubility and crystallization points. Finally, Essay B's safety section is generic, failing to name the specific salts being used, and it completely omits any mention of environmental or ethical considerations, which is a significant oversight.",
