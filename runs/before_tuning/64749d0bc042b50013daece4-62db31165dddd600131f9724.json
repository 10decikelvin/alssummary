  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it presents a complete and exceptionally thorough exploration of its research topic, excelling in all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and detailed, specifying not only the variables but also their precise ranges and the measurement technique (\"Winkler's titration\"). The background information is robust, linking the experiment to a pertinent global issue (climate change), providing clear chemical principles with equations, and justifying the choice of methodology by comparing it to viable alternatives. The greatest strength of Essay A lies in its meticulous planning, evidenced by its comprehensive tables for variables, which not only identify but also explain *why* and *how* each is controlled, demonstrating a deep understanding of experimental design.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating a strong start with a good personal rationale and solid scientific background on ascorbic acid and redox chemistry, is critically incomplete. The text abruptly ends before detailing the variables, methodology, or safety considerations, which are essential components of the Exploration criterion. Although the introduction and hypothesis are well-written and grounded in theory like the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, they cannot compensate for the missing sections. In contrast, Essay A provides a complete, reproducible procedure, a full apparatus list with uncertainties, and a detailed safety and disposal table. The level of detail in Essay A's methodology, particularly in its control of variables like \"Exposure to atmospheric oxygen\" and \"Atmospheric pressure,\" far exceeds the foundational elements presented in Essay B. Therefore, based on the completeness, scientific rigor, and meticulous detail provided, Essay A is the superior submission.",
