  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and appropriate investigations for the IB Chemistry level. Essay B provides a strong theoretical background, clearly linking concepts of chemical kinetics like collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Arrhenius equation to its research question. Its methodology is logical, and it includes commendable preliminary calculations for solution preparation. However, a significant weakness in Essay B's exploration is that it assumes the reaction order (m=1, n=1) based on an external source rather than determining it experimentally. This assumption is fundamental to the calculation of the rate constant 'k', which is the dependent variable, making the entire premise of the investigation less self-contained and rigorous.\n\nEssay A, while its background lacks a detailed chemical explanation for *why* sodium bicarbonate would affect Young's Modulus, excels in its experimental design and methodology. The research question is sharply focused. The procedure is exceptionally detailed, replicable, and incorporates modern technology (Vernier LabQuest 2, Tracker software) to enhance accuracy, which is a significant strength. Most impressively, Essay A's treatment of variables is exemplary; it not only clearly identifies and justifies controlled variables in a table but also thoughtfully considers and discusses uncontrolled variables, demonstrating a superior understanding of the limitations and nuances of the experimental process. Furthermore, its risk assessment is more comprehensive, including a mature ethical consideration regarding the use of food-based materials.\n\nOverall, while Essay B has a strong theoretical foundation, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and sophisticated approach to the practical design and planning of the experiment. The meticulous attention to variables, the advanced data collection methods, and the comprehensive risk assessment make Essay A the better example of Criterion B.",
