  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids (CaCO3 and MgCO3) in HCl solutions of varying concentrations...\", is exceptionally focused and precise, clearly defining all parameters. The methodology of Essay A is a key strength; the inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section is a mark of a high-quality investigation, as it provides a clear rationale for the chosen range of the independent variable and the duration of the experiment. Furthermore, Essay A's variables section is exemplary, using a table to meticulously detail not only what is controlled, but also why it needs to be controlled and how this control is achieved. The safety and environmental section is also more comprehensive, featuring a detailed hazard table and a thoughtful discussion on minimizing waste based on stoichiometric calculations.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a solid investigation with good personal context and relevant background chemistry, it has several weaknesses in comparison. Its research question involves two independent variables (temperature and type of juice), which slightly reduces the focus of the investigation. More critically, the \"Variables\" section incorrectly lists \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable, when it is clearly being investigated as a second independent variable, indicating a slight confusion in experimental design. Although its methodology is adequate, it lacks the evidence of refinement seen in Essay A's pre-testing. Consequently, Essay A demonstrates a more rigorous, thoughtful, and well-planned approach to the scientific process.",
