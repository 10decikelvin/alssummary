  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and well-structured approach to Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused, clearly stating the independent variables (temperature, juice type) and the dependent variable (vitamin C concentration). The background information provides a strong personal context rooted in a relevant real-world issue (post-COVID immunity), which then transitions smoothly into a detailed scientific explanation of Vitamin C and the principles of redox titration, directly justifying the methodology. Essay B's identification and control of variables are exemplary, presented in a clear table with robust justifications for each. Furthermore, its section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is comprehensive and thoughtful, addressing not only standard lab safety but also the ethics of food use and energy consumption.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay A also shows good personal engagement in its background, its exploration has some significant weaknesses. The student misidentifies the independent variable as the \"Mass of sample,\" when it is actually the *source* of the sample (chalk, seashell, rangoli) and the methodology used. A more significant issue is the fundamental flaw in the thermal decomposition method; the student correctly notes in their evaluation that a Bunsen burner cannot reach the required temperature for complete decomposition, which is a design flaw that should have been addressed during the planning phase. While both essays make a minor error in suggesting a measuring cylinder for a precise volume measurement where a pipette would be superior, Essay B's overall methodology is more sound and replicable. Therefore, Essay B is stronger due to its superior scientific background, more accurate identification of variables, more robust methodology, and more comprehensive consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental issues.",
