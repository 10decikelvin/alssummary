  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of exploration and chemical understanding, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its background section is exceptionally thorough, providing excellent personal context (\"scaloppine al limone\") and then delving into a sophisticated explanation of the role of antioxidants, the molecular structure of ascorbic acid, and its oxidation pathway. Essay B's justification for its hypothesis is also more advanced, correctly applying principles of chemical kinetics and referencing the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve to explain the effect of temperature on reaction rates. In contrast, while Essay A presents a competent and logical investigation, its background theory is more simplistic, with explanations like \"the cage is rigid enough to prevent the molecules from moving\" lacking the chemical depth seen in Essay B. Furthermore, Essay B's chosen methodology\u2014a redox titration\u2014is a standard and precise quantitative technique, and the essay clearly explains the complex chemistry behind the titration's endpoint. Although Essay A provides a more complete step-by-step procedure in the provided text, the overall quality of the scientific exploration, contextualization, and theoretical foundation in Essay B is significantly higher.",
