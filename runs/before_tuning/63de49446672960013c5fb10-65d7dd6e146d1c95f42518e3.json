  "reasoning": "Slight edge to submission - criteria for this judgment call below is detailed reasoning below. Both students seem to have produced competent responses, using examples that could be used to earn high marks. Both responses provided similar descriptions of relevant biological arguments, but Student 2 provided more specific descriptions of the evidence for the specific experiment they are referring to. The student makes strong links to theoretical frameworks like the stress vulnerability model, indicating a slightly deeper understanding of the subject matter compared to the sample response which only implicitly refers to it. Although neither response directly mentions the limitations related to self-if reports, both provide valuable insights into the complexity of assessing the relationship between gender norms and subjective well being in collectivistic versus individualistic cultures.",
