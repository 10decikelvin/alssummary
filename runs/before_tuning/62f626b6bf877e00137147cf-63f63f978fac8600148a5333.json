  "reasoning": "Essay B is unequivocally superior to Essay A, demonstrating a much higher level of achievement across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\", is focused, precise, and outlines all key components of the investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question is phrased as a statement and lacks clarity. Furthermore, Essay B provides an extensive, well-researched background section that thoroughly explains the real-world context, the underlying chemical principles of biosorption, and the rationale for choosing the specific pH range and analytical method. Essay A's introduction is a single sentence that provides no meaningful context for the experiment.\n\nThe methodological planning in Essay B is exemplary, featuring a detailed account of preliminary trials used to refine the procedure, a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear justifications for their importance, and a step-by-step procedure that is logical and repeatable. Essay A's methodology is a fragmented list of steps that omits crucial details like sample preparation and fails to identify any controlled variables, a critical flaw in experimental design. While both essays include a risk assessment, Essay B's overall approach reflects a deep, personal engagement with the scientific process, from justifying its methodology over alternatives to anticipating potential issues. Essay A, on the other hand, presents a superficial plan that lacks the depth and scientific rigor expected in a successful investigation.",
