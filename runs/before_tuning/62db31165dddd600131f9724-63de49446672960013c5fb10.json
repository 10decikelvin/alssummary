  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused, specifying not just the substance but the exact commercial source (\"Nature's Own tablets (200 mg)\"). The background information is exceptionally thorough, not only explaining the necessary analytical technique (UV-Vis spectrometry via the Beer-Lambert law) but also delving into advanced concepts like crystal field theory to justify the formation of a colored complex. The standout feature of Essay B is the \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which showcases a sophisticated, iterative approach to experimental design; the student identifies practical problems like insoluble binders and precipitate formation and systematically develops solutions, such as filtration and inducing micelle formation. This demonstrates a high degree of personal engagement and scientific creativity. In contrast, Essay A presents a more standard investigation, and while its background on titration is scientifically sound, it lacks the depth of Essay B. The most significant weakness of Essay A is the complete absence of a methodology, a full list of variables, and any safety considerations, making a full evaluation of its experimental plan impossible. Essay B's methodology is meticulous, its list of controlled variables is extensive and well-justified, and its safety assessment is comprehensive, addressing specific chemical and physical hazards with appropriate precautions. Therefore, Essay B is clearly superior due to its depth, methodological rigor, and clear evidence of an authentic investigative process.",
