  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong plans for their respective investigations, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of methodological sophistication and chemical insight, making it superior for Criterion B. Essay A outlines a classic, well-structured calorimetry experiment. Its strengths lie in its clear, two-part research question, meticulous organization (especially the use of tables for variables and alcohols), and a comprehensive and exemplary safety section. The plan to test twelve different alcohols to address both parts of the research question is ambitious and well-conceived. However, the experimental technique itself is standard.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, plans a more complex and nuanced investigation into the diverse ion effect on solubility. The personal engagement in the introduction, linking the chemistry to fertilizers, is compelling. The background explanation of the 'salting-in' effect and ionic atmospheres is detailed and scientifically rigorous. Most importantly, the chosen methodology is sophisticated, involving UV-Vis spectrophotometry, the creation of a calibration curve, and the crucial step of centrifuging samples to remove suspended solids before analysis. This foresight in the experimental design to mitigate a major potential error (light scattering) showcases a deeper level of planning and understanding than the standard calorimetry in Essay A. While Essay B's safety section is noticeably less detailed than Essay A's, the overall quality of its scientific exploration\u2014from the advanced concept to the elegant experimental design\u2014is more impressive.",
