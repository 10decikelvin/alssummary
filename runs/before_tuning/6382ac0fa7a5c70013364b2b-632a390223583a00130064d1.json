  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration. Its research question, 'How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?', is focused, quantitative, and allows for a clear investigation of a relationship between two variables. In contrast, Essay A's research question is less focused, attempting to compare both different substances and different methodologies simultaneously. Essay B excels in its methodology, presenting a comprehensive list of controlled variables with clear justifications, and even thoughtfully considers uncontrolled variables and their potential impact. The procedure in Essay B is meticulously detailed, incorporating modern technology like a Vernier LabQuest and Tracker software to enhance accuracy. Essay A's procedure, while detailed, contains a significant flaw in using a measuring cylinder instead of a pipette for titration, which severely impacts the precision of that method. Finally, while both essays have good safety sections, Essay B's inclusion of ethical considerations regarding the use of food materials shows a higher level of critical thinking.",
