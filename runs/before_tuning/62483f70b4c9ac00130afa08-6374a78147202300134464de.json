  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is significantly more sophisticated and focused than Essay B's question. Rather than simply confirming a known relationship, Essay A sets out to evaluate a specific analytical technique, which shows a higher level of scientific inquiry. The background information in Essay A is exceptional; it provides a compelling global context (climate change, Paris Agreement), explains the underlying chemistry of dissolved oxygen with Le Chatelier's Principle, and critically compares multiple methods for measuring DO, which provides a powerful and logical justification for the experimental design. In contrast, Essay B's background is more generic, with a personal introduction and a potential conceptual confusion between reaction rate (collision theory) and enthalpy change, which is a state function dependent on the amount of limiting reactant, not the concentration of the excess reactant.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A is far more rigorous. The procedure is detailed, replicable, and includes thoughtful considerations such as noting the need for a slow water stream to prevent aeration, a finding from preliminary trials. The safety, environmental, and ethical considerations section in Essay A is thorough, identifying specific chemical hazards and proper disposal protocols. Essay B's methodology is for a very standard calorimetry experiment, but it is weakened by only testing two concentrations (0.5M and 1.0M), which is insufficient to establish a meaningful trend. Furthermore, its risk assessment is brief and less specific than Essay A's. Overall, Essay A presents a well-researched, personally-developed, and methodologically sound investigation that far exceeds the quality of the standard-fare experiment described in Essay B.",
