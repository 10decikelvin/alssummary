  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a basic understanding of experimental design, but neither fully meets the criteria for a high-level assessment. Student A provides a more comprehensive introduction and a clear, well-structured methodology. However, the 'Results' section in Student A's work is absent from the provided text, making it impossible to evaluate their data analysis and conclusion. Student B, on the other hand, presents a complete report from introduction to conclusion, but their methodology lacks rigor. Specifically, the statement about using a kitchen scale with a precision of only \u00b11g suggests a significant limitation in their experimental setup, which is not adequately addressed in their evaluation of errors. The large discrepancy between their experimental results and literature values, as shown in their graph, further highlights this issue. Although Student A's submission is incomplete, the portion that is visible demonstrates a stronger foundation in scientific inquiry. The detailed methodology and consideration of variables suggest a more thoughtful experimental design. Therefore, based on the provided text, Student A's work is of a higher quality, despite the missing sections. If I had to choose, I would give a slight edge to Student A based on the visible parts of their work. They have a well-structured introduction, a detailed method section, and a clear understanding of the variables. Their experiment seems more carefully planned than Student B's. However, without seeing the data analysis and conclusion, it is difficult to give a final verdict. Student B's submission is complete, but the experimental design has significant flaws, as indicated by the use of imprecise equipment and the resulting large experimental error. Given the choice, I'll favor the report that demonstrates better scientific rigor in its design and planning, even if it's incomplete.",
