  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more focused and well-designed investigation, making it superior for Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is clear, concise, and establishes a direct, quantifiable relationship between the independent variable (time) and the dependent variable (Vitamin C content). The background information is highly relevant, explaining both the properties of ascorbic acid and the chemical principles of the redox titration. Furthermore, the methodology is logical, easy to follow, and includes well-defined controlled variables such as \"Type and brand of bell pepper\" and \"Temperature Of Water Bath,\" demonstrating a strong understanding of experimental design.\n\nEssay B, while chemically more ambitious, is weaker in its foundational design. The research question is convoluted and poorly phrased: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies...\". This phrasing is confusing as the methodology describes a primary data investigation, not a secondary data comparison. The independent variable is categorical (\"4 different Water bodies\") and justified by qualitative observations and secondary sources, which is less rigorous than the continuous, directly controlled variable in Essay A. Although Essay B's safety assessment is exceptionally thorough and its chemical procedure is complex, the overall exploration is let down by the lack of focus in its research question and a less controlled experimental framework. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a better overall quality of exploration due to its superior clarity, focus, and experimental design.",
