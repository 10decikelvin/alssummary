  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its demonstration of Criterion B criteria. The research question in Essay A is exceptionally well-focused and sophisticated, aiming to determine a specific physical constant (activation energy) and precisely outlining the conditions and measurement techniques. In contrast, Essay B's question, while viable, is less focused due to having two independent variables (temperature and juice type).\n\nThe background section of Essay A is rigorous, providing a detailed explanation of the reaction mechanism, rate laws, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly relevant to the methodology. Essay B's background is good but focuses more on the biological importance of Vitamin C rather than the chemical kinetics of its degradation, which is central to its hypothesis.\n\nMost significantly, Essay A's methodology is strengthened by the inclusion of preliminary testing. This demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design, allowing the student to justify choices like the temperature range and procedural details (e.g., not capping the cuvettes) based on empirical evidence. Essay B lacks this element, making its procedural choices seem more arbitrary. Furthermore, Essay A's identification and control of variables is meticulous and accurate, whereas Essay B incorrectly lists an independent variable (\"Type of juice\") as a controlled variable. Finally, the safety and environmental considerations in Essay A are slightly more comprehensive, specifically addressing the product (iodopropanone) in addition to the reactants.",
