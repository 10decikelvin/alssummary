  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a solid understanding of the scientific method, however, Essay B is superior due to its more thorough and well-structured approach. The introduction of Essay B clearly states the personal context and the purpose of the experiment, which is a strength. Furthermore, it explicitly states a hypothesis, which is absent in Essay A. Both essays present data tables and graphs appropriately, but Essay B's inclusion of multiple locations (lake, river, stream) adds a layer of complexity and demonstrates a more comprehensive investigation. The discussion of errors in Essay B is more detailed and specific than in Essay A, clearly separating systematic and random errors and suggesting concrete improvements. The extension in Essay B is also more insightful, proposing further research that logically builds upon the initial findings. In contrast, while Essay A's experiment is sound, its presentation lacks the depth and clarity seen in Essay B. The discussion of errors in Essay A is somewhat generic, and the conclusion is less developed. Therefore, based on the depth of research, clarity of presentation, and critical evaluation, Essay B is the stronger piece of work.",
