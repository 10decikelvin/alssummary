  "reasoning": "While both essays present viable investigations, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach to the \"Exploration\" criterion.\n\nEssay B's strength lies in its clear, focused research question and its excellent personal engagement, which provides a compelling context for the investigation into electroplating. The background information is also relevant, directly linking to Faraday's Laws. However, its methodology section has a critical flaw: the table for controlled variables is completely empty. This is a major omission, as it fails to demonstrate the student's consideration of factors that must be kept constant to ensure a fair test.\n\nEssay A, on the other hand, presents a well-structured and detailed methodology. The research question is well-focused, linking an independent variable (concentration of MgCl\u2082) to a dependent variable (solubility of CaSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O) via a specific analytical technique (Beer-Lambert's Law). The background information effectively explains the underlying chemical principles. Crucially, its controlled variables are not only identified but also justified, with clear methods for how they will be controlled. The inclusion of a calibration curve procedure further highlights a sophisticated understanding of the experimental design required for this type of quantitative analysis. While the personal engagement in Essay A is less compelling than in Essay B, the overall quality of the experimental design and planning is significantly stronger.\n\nTherefore, because of its superior methodology and detailed consideration of variables, Essay A is the better example of the Exploration criterion.",
