  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific exploration and understanding, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", establishes a sophisticated investigation into the relationship between two continuous variables, which is more advanced than Essay B's comparative question about discrete brands. The background information in Essay A is exemplary; it not only explains the underlying chemical principles like the Arrhenius equation but also mathematically derives the second-order integrated rate law (`1/c - 1/c\u2080 = kt`), which directly justifies the entire experimental methodology. This showcases a deep, personal engagement with the theory. In contrast, Essay B's background explains basic acid-base stoichiometry, which is far less complex.\n\nFurthermore, the methodology in Essay A, involving timed sampling, quenching the reaction with HCl, and subsequent titration, is inherently more complex and demanding than the simple direct titration performed in Essay B. While both essays clearly outline their variables, Essay A's control of variables is embedded within a more challenging procedure. Essay A also provides a more thorough and responsible assessment of safety concerns, identifying the flammability of ethyl acetate and the corrosiveness of NaOH, whereas Essay B's safety section is weak, incorrectly stating that gloves are \"not necessary\" for handling NaOH. Finally, Essay B's methodology has a critical flaw, which it acknowledges in its limitations: other acids in the orange juice (like citric acid) will also react with the NaOH, making it impossible to isolate the concentration of ascorbic acid alone with this method. This fundamental issue significantly compromises the validity of Essay B's investigation, whereas Essay A's methodology is a standard and valid approach to studying reaction kinetics.",
