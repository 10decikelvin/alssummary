  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to the exploration criteria. Its research question is exceptionally well-formulated: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...\". This question is focused, specific, and directly measurable, providing a clear framework for the entire investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...?\", is vague and evaluative, making it difficult to answer quantitatively. While Essay A provides good background context on dissolved oxygen and the Winkler method, Essay B's background is more impressive as it deeply integrates complex chemical principles like the Arrhenius equation and the Beer-Lambert law, directly justifying its methodological choices.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is superior due to its meticulous planning. The variables are presented in a comprehensive table that not only identifies them but also justifies why and how they are controlled, which is a hallmark of a high-level investigation. Essay A identifies its variables but with less detailed justification. Furthermore, Essay B's safety assessment is far more thorough, breaking down the risks for each specific chemical and outlining clear mitigation strategies, whereas Essay A's risk assessment is comparatively brief. Both essays effectively use preliminary trials to refine their procedures, showing good personal engagement, but the overall scientific rigor, clarity, and depth of planning in Essay B are of a higher quality.",
