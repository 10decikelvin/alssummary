  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its exceptional methodological development and completeness. The standout feature of Essay A is the \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which details a logical and scientific process of overcoming experimental challenges. For instance, the student identifies the issue of insoluble tablet binders and implements filtration, and more impressively, tackles the problem of precipitate formation by researching and applying the advanced concept of micelle formation, even testing alternative dyes when the initial choice was unavailable. This demonstrates a high level of personal engagement and scientific problem-solving. In contrast, Essay B, while providing a solid scientific background for its titration method, lacks any evidence of such methodological refinement.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A presents a fully realized experimental plan. The variables are numerous, specific, and well-justified, including subtle but important controls like using the \"same cuvette for every trial\" and cooling all heated samples \"to the same temperature (19.7\u00b0C)\" before analysis. The procedure is meticulously detailed and replicable. Essay B is significantly weaker as it is incomplete, entirely missing the content for its variables table, the apparatus list, safety considerations, and the procedure itself. While Essay B's research question and background are sound, Essay A's comprehensive planning, rigorous control of variables, and authentic approach to experimental design make it a much stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
