  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and well-structured investigations. Essay A has a clear research question comparing not only different samples but also two distinct analytical methodologies, which is ambitious and demonstrates good scope. The background provides strong personal context and links the investigation to a real-world issue (ocean acidification), which is commendable. However, its methodology contains notable weaknesses, such as using a measuring cylinder for titrations where a pipette is required for precision, and misidentifying the independent variable as \"Mass of sample\" instead of the \"Source of sample\" and \"Methodology\".\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific rigor and planning. Its research question is sharply focused, and the background information provides a detailed chemical basis for the investigation, complete with reaction diagrams. The methodology is exceptionally thorough, including steps for standardizing reagents and conducting a preliminary experiment, which are hallmarks of an excellent experimental design. Most impressively, the identification and control of variables are exemplary, presented in a detailed table explaining not just what will be controlled, but how and why, considering subtle factors like microbial contamination and light exposure. While Essay A is a competent IA, Essay B's meticulous attention to detail, methodological justification, and superior handling of variables make it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
