  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B. Essay B provides a more comprehensive safety, ethical, and environmental section, detailing specific hazards for each chemical used. Its theoretical background is also excellent, skillfully connecting the equilibrium constant (Kc) to Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation, which demonstrates a deep conceptual understanding. However, Essay A is marginally superior due to its more compelling rationale and the sophistication of its experimental design. Essay A establishes a strong real-world context related to water pollution and articulates a clear personal motivation, which makes the exploration feel more authentic. Crucially, its methodology shows a higher level of critical thinking; for example, the student researches the \"scavenging effect\" of H2O2 and deliberately chooses a concentration range to avoid this phenomenon, quoting literature to justify this decision. This level of forethought, combined with an excellent preliminary trials section that led to significant methodological refinement, elevates the quality of its exploration beyond Essay B's well-executed but more standard investigation. While Essay B is outstanding, Essay A's inquiry feels more original and demonstrates a more nuanced engagement with the scientific process.",
