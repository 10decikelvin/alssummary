  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B, making this a close comparison. Essay B is commendable for its explicit discussion of a \"Pre-test,\" which shows excellent scientific practice in refining the methodology and justifies the chosen range of concentrations. Furthermore, its safety, ethical, and environmental section is exemplary, providing specific details, hazard symbols, and a thoughtful approach to waste minimization based on stoichiometric calculations. However, Essay A demonstrates a more sophisticated and in-depth exploration of the underlying chemical theory. Its background section thoroughly explains the concept of buffers, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and two distinct formulas for buffer capacity, one of which is used to generate a theoretical curve for comparison. This level of theoretical detail provides a stronger foundation for the investigation. Essay A's rationale for adapting the buffer system from the biological context to a feasible lab alternative also showcases a higher degree of personal engagement and critical thinking in the design phase. While Essay B's methodology is solid, Essay A's use of more precise technology (wireless pH probe, drop counter) and its deeper theoretical exploration ultimately make it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
