  "reasoning": "The provided text is an excerpt from a student's lab report, likely for an International Baccalaureate (IB) Chemistry class, focusing on an electrolysis experiment. This excerpt covers the research question, introduction, and experimental methodology, including a detailed list of materials and procedures.  As there is only one piece of text provided (labeled 'essay_a'), I am unable to perform a comparative analysis to determine which of two documents is 'better'. I am designed to analyze and compare two texts based on specific criteria. Without the second text ('essay_b'), I cannot provide a meaningful comparison or decide which one is superior. Both inputs are required for me to perform the requested task.",
