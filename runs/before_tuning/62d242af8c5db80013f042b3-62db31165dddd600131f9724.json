  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much more thorough and complete exploration of the proposed investigation, fully addressing all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, while slightly wordy, is focused and appropriate. The background information provides a solid chemical foundation for the complexometric back-titration, justifying the choice of reagents like EDTA and EBT. Crucially, Essay A includes a comprehensive, replicable method, a detailed list of controlled variables with clear justification for why each must be controlled, and robust safety and environmental considerations. The inclusion of a \"Comparison of Method\" section and a detailed \"Limitations\" table with proposed improvements demonstrates a very high level of critical thinking and engagement with the experimental design.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, is severely underdeveloped. While its introduction and background information on ascorbic acid and redox titrations are well-written and scientifically sound, it is critically incomplete. The essay completely lacks a procedural methodology, which is a fundamental requirement for Criterion B. Furthermore, the variables section is just a table header with no variables listed, and there are no safety, ethical, or environmental considerations mentioned. Although the hypothesis in Essay B is well-justified with a link to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, this strength cannot compensate for the missing core components of the experimental plan.\n\nIn summary, Essay A provides a complete, well-reasoned, and detailed experimental plan, demonstrating a mastery of the requirements for Criterion B. Essay B, despite a promising start with its background section, fails to provide the essential methodological details necessary for a successful exploration.",
