  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it provides a complete and well-developed exploration, fulfilling all aspects of Criterion B, whereas Essay B has significant omissions and flaws in its experimental design. Essay A establishes a strong scientific context with a detailed introduction and background, linking the topic of dissolved oxygen to a real-world application (\"fish business\") and thoroughly explaining the underlying chemistry of the \"Winkler Method\" with relevant equations. In contrast, Essay B is entirely missing an introduction or background section, failing to establish any context for why calcium content in milk is being investigated.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is robust, detailed, and replicable, outlining a clear plan to manipulate the independent variable (\"Preparing Different concentrations of Salt in water\") and control others (\"The experiment was done in a water bath of which was set to keep temperature constant at 10\u00b0C\"). Essay B's methodology is incomplete; while it details the titration procedure, it critically fails to explain how the independent variable\u2014the expiration date\u2014will be managed over time. Essay A also demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design by explicitly defining all variables (independent, dependent, controlled) in a table with justifications, a fundamental component that Essay B completely omits. Finally, while both essays include risk assessments, Essay A's is more comprehensive, explicitly addressing \"Safety, Environmental and Ethical considerations\" in separate, well-reasoned points. Essay B even acknowledges a major flaw in its own chosen method (\"EDTA is known to collect other substances apart from calcium such as magnesium\"), which reflects a poorly considered experimental design from the outset.",
