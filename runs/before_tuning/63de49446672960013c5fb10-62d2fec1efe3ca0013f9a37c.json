  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of inquiry and experimental design, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. The research question is well-focused and grounded in a real-world context (vitamin degradation in supplements). The background information is thorough, explaining not just the necessary theory of UV-Vis spectrometry but also demonstrating excellent problem-solving by researching and implementing a complexation and micelle formation procedure to make the analysis possible. This indicates a high degree of personal engagement and initiative. The methodology is detailed, logical, and employs sophisticated techniques like creating a calibration curve for accurate quantification. The list of controlled variables is extensive and shows a mature understanding of what factors could influence the results.\n\nEssay B, while presenting a valid and classic kinetics experiment, is weaker in its design. The research question is clear, but the methodology relies on subjective visual assessment (\"determined by the naked eye\") to measure the reaction rate, which introduces significant potential for random error. While the student identifies this as a limitation in their evaluation, a stronger experimental design would have incorporated a more objective measurement tool like a colorimeter from the outset. Furthermore, the control of temperature using a simple hot plate and fridge is less precise than the water baths used in Essay A. Although Essay B has a solid theoretical background, the procedural planning and rigor of Essay A are far superior.",
