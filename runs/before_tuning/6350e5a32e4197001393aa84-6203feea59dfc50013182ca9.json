  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong plans for investigation under Criterion B. However, Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated research question, deeper scientific context, and more detailed and well-justified experimental design.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen...?\", is clear and focused. The background information on the Winkler method and dissolved oxygen is relevant, and the safety considerations are thorough. However, the methodology lacks specificity regarding the range of salt concentrations to be tested, stating only to repeat the steps \"for the different masses\". This is a notable weakness in the experimental design.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days...?\", is more complex, investigating not just an instantaneous measurement but a rate of change (BOD) over time. The background section is excellent, clearly defining BOD and linking it to a well-articulated personal context and a specific hypothesis based on observations of a local pond. The variables section is exemplary, with a detailed table explaining not just what will be controlled but *how* it will be controlled. Furthermore, the safety section's tabular format, linking specific chemicals to their potential risks, is highly effective and clear. While the method for altering pH (\"adding 6 drops of HCl\") could be more precise, the overall plan is more ambitious and demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement than Essay A.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A provides a solid and competent plan, Essay B demonstrates a higher degree of personal engagement, scientific curiosity, and meticulous planning, making it the better example of IB exploration.",
