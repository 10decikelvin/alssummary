  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the scientific principles and experimental design required for a successful investigation. The research question is clear, focused, and directly addressed by the chosen methodology. The background information provides a thorough and relevant explanation of kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the chemistry of bleach, including the necessary preliminary titration to determine its concentration. The methodology is logical, detailed, and replicable. Variables are not only correctly identified but their importance and method of control are also clearly justified, which is a key aspect of this criterion.\n\nEssay B, while based on an interesting premise, suffers from several significant weaknesses. The explanation of the complexometric titration chemistry is convoluted and appears to conflate a direct titration with a back titration, leaving the reader unsure of the actual process and its validity. The methodology section is further weakened by the inclusion of a \"Limitations\" and \"Improvements\" table, which belongs in the Evaluation (Criterion C) section of the report, indicating a misunderstanding of the IA structure. While the identification of variables is adequate, the justification for their control is less detailed than in Essay A. Overall, Essay A presents a more coherent, scientifically sound, and well-structured plan for investigation, making it the superior example for Criterion B.",
