  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does varying temperature...affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator,\" is highly focused, complex, and sets up a genuine scientific investigation into the relationship between variables. The background information is comprehensive, linking the BZ reaction to real-world phenomena like cardiac arrhythmia and thoroughly explaining the underlying chemical principles, including redox, collision theory, and reaction mechanisms. A key strength of Essay A is the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which details a thoughtful, iterative process of selecting equipment (e.g., trying a stopwatch, colorimeter, and finally a lux sensor) and justifying the chosen experimental parameters based on preliminary trials and lab limitations; this is a hallmark of an excellent exploration. The table of controlled variables is exemplary, providing not just the variable but a clear reason for its control and the specific method of control.\n\nEssay B, while competent, is weaker in several areas. Its research question is less of an investigation and more of a comparative exercise between two standard analytical techniques. The background information is superficial, providing the necessary chemical equations but lacking depth in explaining the theory behind back titration or thermal decomposition. The identification of variables in Essay B is confused; it misidentifies the independent variable as \"Mass of sample\" when it is actually the source of the sample and the methodology being used. While Essay B adequately covers safety and environmental aspects, its justification for the methodology is weak, essentially stating it was in a textbook, and the control of variables is less rigorous\u2014for instance, suggesting that using the \"same Bunsen Burner\" is an effective way to control temperature for thermal decomposition is a significant oversimplification. Overall, Essay A presents a much more sophisticated, well-researched, and thoughtfully planned investigation.",
