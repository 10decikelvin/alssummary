  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more scientifically rigorous investigation. Its research question is highly focused and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of chemical kinetics, aiming to determine a specific physical constant, the activation energy. The background information is comprehensive, linking reaction mechanisms, the rate-determining step, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation into a cohesive theoretical framework that perfectly justifies the experimental design. Furthermore, the methodology of Essay A is exceptionally detailed, with clear justification for the choice of variables and ranges, supported by preliminary testing which shows a process of refinement. The safety and risk assessment in Essay A is thorough, considering all reactants and even the product, which is a hallmark of a high-quality exploration.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's investigation, while having a clear question and structure, is built on a significant methodological flaw. It aims to determine the concentration of ascorbic acid in orange juice via an acid-base titration with NaOH. However, as the student correctly identifies in their limitations, orange juice contains other acids (like citric acid) which will also react with the NaOH. This means the experiment does not, and cannot, selectively measure ascorbic acid concentration, thus invalidating the results in the context of the research question. While it's good that the student recognized this limitation, it is a fundamental flaw in the experimental design itself. Additionally, Essay B's safety precautions are notably weaker, dismissing the need for gloves with a weak justification. Therefore, Essay A's robust, well-justified, and scientifically sound approach makes it the superior piece of work.",
