  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated and thorough approach to the exploration criteria. Its research question is highly focused on a single, well-defined relationship between catalyst mass and reaction time. The background information is excellent, moving beyond general principles to discuss the specific mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis via active sites, which provides a strong theoretical foundation for the investigation. Furthermore, Essay B shows exceptional thoughtfulness in its experimental design and control of variables; for instance, the student addresses the critical variable of catalyst surface area by creating a standardized grinding procedure and acknowledges this as a limitation, which shows a high level of scientific awareness. The justification for using six data points and two different volumes to strengthen the findings, along with the self-reflection in the \"Reference to Convention\" section, highlights a deeper engagement with the scientific process.\n\nEssay A presents a solid and well-structured investigation, with a clear procedure and good background on vitamin C and titration. However, it contains a significant conceptual flaw in its variables section, where \"Type of juice\" is listed as a controlled variable while simultaneously being treated as a second independent variable. This confusion undermines the clarity of the experimental design. While the titration method itself is precise, the overall methodological planning and scientific justification in Essay B are superior. Essay B's safety section is also stronger, citing a specific source (CLEAPPS) and referencing the Principles of Green Chemistry, indicating more thorough research. Therefore, Essay B excels due to its deeper scientific context, more rigorous control of variables, and a higher degree of critical reflection on its own methodology.",
