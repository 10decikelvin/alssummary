  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior due to its focused and scientifically sound background, robust experimental design, and clear connection between its methodology and research question. The background information in Essay A provides a relevant and detailed explanation of the redox titration chemistry, stating \"when the iodine is being added to the solution it continues to react with the ascorbic acid... when all of the acid has been oxidised the iodine... will react with the starch indicator... and form a blue-black starch iodine complex,\" which directly justifies the chosen method. In contrast, Essay B's background contains a significant conceptual error by incorrectly linking concentration to enthalpy change via collision theory, which actually explains reaction *rates* rather than thermodynamics. This fundamental misunderstanding weakens the entire premise of the investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is far more thorough, proposing five different time intervals (\"0,5,10,15,20 mins\") with three trials for each, which is a strong design for establishing a trend. Essay B's methodology is comparatively weak, testing only two concentrations (\"0.5M & 1.0M\"), which is insufficient for a meaningful investigation into the effect of a variable. While both essays correctly identify variables and address safety, Essay A's hypothesis is more nuanced (\"there will be an observable increase in rate of vitamin C loss due to increased breakdown of cell walls\"), showing a deeper engagement with the topic than Essay B's flawed hypothesis that enthalpy change will increase with concentration. Overall, Essay A presents a well-planned, scientifically accurate, and rigorous exploration, while Essay B's exploration is built upon a flawed premise and a weak experimental plan.",
