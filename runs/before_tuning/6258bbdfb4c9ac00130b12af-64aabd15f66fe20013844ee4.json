  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is well-focused, and it is supported by a chemically rigorous background section that clearly explains the principles of Acid Value and Saponification Value determination, including the relevant hydrolysis reactions. Its methodology is highly detailed, replicable, and includes a separate \"Justification for methodology\" section, which demonstrates a high level of critical thinking in the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A features a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear explanations and a thorough risk assessment that addresses multiple specific hazards with appropriate precautions.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question and good personal context, suffers from a critical flaw in its experimental design. The chosen methodology\u2014an acid-base titration with NaOH\u2014is not selective for ascorbic acid and will neutralize other acids present in orange juice (like citric and malic acid), a weakness the student acknowledges but should have addressed during the planning stage. This fundamental flaw invalidates the method's ability to accurately answer the research question. Additionally, Essay B's safety section is dangerously inadequate, incorrectly stating that gloves are unnecessary with 0.05M NaOH, and it completely omits any ethical or environmental considerations. Overall, Essay A demonstrates a much more thorough, thoughtful, and chemically sound exploration.",
