  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger and more thorough approach to experimental design under Criterion B. Its research question, while slightly wordy, clearly establishes a relationship between the independent variable (water source/pollution level) and the dependent variable (dissolved oxygen). The background information effectively justifies the choice of water bodies by linking them to perceived pollution levels with citations and provides a detailed chemical explanation of the Winkler method. Critically, Essay B correctly and clearly identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, which is a fundamental aspect of a scientific exploration. In contrast, Essay A incorrectly identifies its independent variable as \"Temperature change\" and its dependent variable as \"Different types of substances,\" revealing a significant misunderstanding of experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, the methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, outlining not just the main titration but also the preparation and standardization of the sodium thiosulfate titrant, which is a complex but necessary procedure for ensuring accuracy. This level of detail makes the experiment highly replicable. Essay A's procedure is much simpler and contains a methodological flaw (not extrapolating temperature change), which the student later acknowledges. Finally, Essay B's risk assessment is comprehensive, listing specific hazards for each chemical and corresponding control measures, far surpassing the more generic safety precautions listed in Essay A. While Essay A provides good theoretical context, Essay B's command of practical experimental planning is superior across all key aspects of Criterion B.",
