  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior because it presents a complete and comprehensive plan for an investigation, fulfilling all the key requirements of Criterion B, whereas Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay B outlines a detailed, replicable methodology, including specific quantities of chemicals (\"AgNO\u2083 (solid) 0.85g (\u00b10.01g)\"), a step-by-step procedure (\"1. Prepare 100 g of water... 2. Pour 0.85g of AgNO\u2083 to a cup...\"), and a clear list of apparatus. It also includes a dedicated section for \"Experimental safety precautions,\" addressing specific chemical hazards and proper disposal. In contrast, Essay A, while featuring a strong introduction and a well-justified hypothesis, completely omits the methodology, the variables table, and any safety considerations, which are essential components of the exploration. Although Essay B incorrectly identifies the independent and dependent variables\u2014stating \"Independent: Temperature change\" when it is the dependent variable\u2014this conceptual error is less damaging than Essay A's failure to provide the core experimental plan. Essay B's research question is ambitious and its methodology is challenging, but it demonstrates a full attempt at designing a scientific investigation from start to finish. Essay A provides an excellent theoretical foundation but fails to deliver the actual \"Exploration\" itself.",
