  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much deeper and more thorough approach to the exploration criteria. Its research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is focused, clear, and well-suited for an investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to tackle two independent variables, which makes the scope less focused. The background information in Essay B is a significant strength; it provides detailed and relevant chemical theory, including the redox chemistry of ascorbic acid titration and a sophisticated justification for its hypothesis using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve. Conversely, Essay A's background is superficial, failing to discuss key concepts like lattice and hydration enthalpy, and its hypothesis is justified with a flawed and irrelevant quote about gas solubility: \"Attractive intermolecular interactions in the gas phase are essentially zero for most substances.\"\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its identification and handling of variables. It presents them in a clear table, correctly identifying the independent, dependent, and a comprehensive list of controlled variables with precise methods for their control (e.g., \"Volume of lemon juice... using a 25ml volumetric pipette\"). Essay A's variable section is confused; it incorrectly lists \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and omits crucial controlled variables like the volume of solvent. While both essays propose appropriate experimental techniques (titration vs. recrystallization), the planning and chemical understanding demonstrated in Essay B are of a much higher caliber. Essay A's methodology also contains conceptual errors, such as describing a solution being heated until it is \"supersaturated\" when the correct term would be saturated. Overall, Essay B presents a well-researched, focused, and methodologically sound plan that is far superior to Essay A's exploration.",
