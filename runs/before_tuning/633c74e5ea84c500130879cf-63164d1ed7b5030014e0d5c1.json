  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior across all facets of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is focused, clear, and appropriately scoped for an IA. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously, which is overly complex and leads to a muddled experimental design. Essay B provides excellent, relevant background information that not only sets the context but also explains the underlying chemistry of the titration method, including a balanced chemical equation. Essay A's background is superficial, failing to adequately explore the theoretical reasons for solubility differences between the chosen anions.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is detailed, logical, and easily replicable, specifying concentrations, masses, and volumes. Essay A's procedure has critical omissions, such as the volume of water used, which makes it impossible to calculate solubility and replicate the experiment. The most significant weakness in Essay A is the identification of variables; it incorrectly lists \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as independent variables, revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of its own experimental design. Essay B, on the other hand, correctly and clearly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables, providing sound justifications for each. Finally, Essay B includes specific, relevant safety precautions related to its procedure (e.g., handling hot plates and iodine), while Essay A offers only generic advice.",
