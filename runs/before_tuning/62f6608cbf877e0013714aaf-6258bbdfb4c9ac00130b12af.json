  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior exploration of a focused chemical principle, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is clear, focused, and directly investigates a fundamental relationship in chemical kinetics. The background information is excellent, demonstrating a high level of understanding by not only stating the Arrhenius equation but also deriving the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction, which directly informs the methodology. This creates a cohesive and logical link between theory and experimental design. The methodology itself is appropriate, well-detailed, and the variables are clearly justified within the context of the derived equations.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while commendable for its thoroughness, is less focused. The research question is more of a descriptive title for two separate investigations (Acid Value and Saponification Value). While the background explains these concepts, it is repetitive and lacks the theoretical depth shown in Essay A. Essay B's greatest strengths lie in its comprehensive list of controlled variables and an exceptionally detailed risk assessment, which are better structured and more thorough than in Essay A. However, the overall methodology is extremely complex and ambitious, bordering on two separate experiments, which can detract from the focus. Ultimately, Essay A's elegant integration of sophisticated theory into a single, well-designed experiment demonstrates a higher quality of exploration, a key component of Criterion B.",
