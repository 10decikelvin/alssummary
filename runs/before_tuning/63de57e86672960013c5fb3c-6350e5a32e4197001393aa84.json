  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better than Essay B in demonstrating the qualities of a strong IB Chemistry Exploration (Criterion B). Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is a model of clarity and focus, precisely defining the independent and dependent variables as well as a key controlled condition. In contrast, Essay B's research question is convoluted, attempting to investigate the effect of NaCl concentration, different water sources, and two different measurement techniques simultaneously, which demonstrates a fundamental lack of focus.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A provides excellent background research that establishes a strong scientific context, connecting the practical application of jewellery making to the theoretical principles of electrolysis and Faraday's Law. It also cites previous studies to inform its hypothesis and methodology. Essay B's background explains the Winkler method but fails to provide the core scientific reasoning for why salinity affects dissolved oxygen levels, a critical omission. Essay A's methodology is logical, detailed, and replicable, with an outstanding justification for the selected range of the independent variable, noting that it will \"be explored but also challenged\". Essay B's methodology is confusingly structured and critically fails to specify the concentrations of NaCl to be tested, making the experiment impossible to replicate and indicating poor planning. Finally, while both essays address safety and environmental concerns, Essay A's considerations are more specific and well-articulated, particularly regarding waste disposal.",
