  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more coherent and scientifically sound investigation for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear, focused, and investigates a valid physical chemistry principle. The background information is highly relevant, correctly defining specific heat capacity, citing literature values, and providing a reasonable molecular-level explanation for the expected trend. Furthermore, the inclusion of a graph for a similar salt (NaCl) provides strong contextual support for the hypothesis. The methodology is logical and directly addresses the research question, outlining a viable calorimetric experiment to determine specific heat capacity.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating impressive background knowledge with calculations of cell potential and Gibbs free energy, is fundamentally flawed in its experimental premise. The research question investigates how concentration affects enthalpy change while keeping the mass of the limiting reactant (zinc) constant. This design conflates reaction rate with the total enthalpy change (\u0394H); theoretically, as long as the copper (II) sulphate is in excess, the total amount of heat evolved should remain constant because it is dictated by the fixed amount of zinc. The background section incorrectly links collision theory (which explains reaction rate) to the overall enthalpy change. This conceptual error undermines the entire investigation, making the methodology, though procedurally correct for calorimetry, inappropriate for answering the stated research question in a meaningful way.\n\nIn summary, Essay A proposes a well-designed and scientifically valid exploration, making it superior. Essay B's impressive theoretical calculations are negated by a critical misunderstanding of thermochemical principles that invalidates the core of its experimental design.",
