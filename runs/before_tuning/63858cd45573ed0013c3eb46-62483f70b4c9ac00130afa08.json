  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior exploration of its topic, primarily due to its well-structured and meticulously justified experimental design. The research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas...\", is focused, clear, and directly investigated. Essay A's key strength lies in its detailed table of variables, which not only identifies each variable but provides robust justifications for how each will be controlled, such as the specific procedure for grinding the MnO\u2082 to control surface area. This demonstrates a deep, practical consideration of the experimental limitations. Furthermore, the background information effectively links the concept of heterogeneous catalysis and active sites directly to the research question, providing a strong theoretical foundation for the investigation.\n\nEssay B, while academically ambitious with its research into the Winkler method, has a less focused research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...\". This question is more evaluative than investigatory, making the experimental design more complex. While its background research is extensive and impressive, the methodology section is not as strong as Essay A's. The controlled variables are mentioned but not justified with the same level of detail; for instance, it simply states \"it will also be assumed that the pressure will remain constant,\" which is a less rigorous approach than the active controls described in Essay A. The overall structure of Essay A, with its clear design narrative and personal engagement in modifying the procedure, exemplifies a more thoughtful and well-planned investigation for Criterion B.",
