  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and thoughtfully designed investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of depth, reflection, and scientific rigor within the planning stages, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A presents a clear and ambitious two-part research question. Its background information is relevant, and the procedure is logical and replicable. The identification and justification for controlling variables are also commendable. However, it lacks specificity in its safety and environmental considerations, focusing primarily on immediate lab safety without mentioning disposal, which is a key aspect of environmental responsibility.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, excels in its meticulous planning and critical thinking. The research question is highly focused and directly testable. The background section is particularly strong, not only explaining the relevant chemistry but also providing a real-world context (anemia) and, crucially, a quantitative justification for the concentration of the titrant used. This demonstrates a proactive approach to experimental design. Furthermore, the methodology section includes a list of apparatus with uncertainties, a justification for the range of the independent variable, and even a note on how the plan was adapted from preliminary trials, showing genuine engagement with the scientific process. The \"Safety, Ethical, and Environmental\" section is also more comprehensive than in Essay A, explicitly addressing waste disposal. Finally, while not strictly part of the planning phase, the detailed \"Evaluation\" section in Essay B, which reflects on potential errors and suggests specific, sophisticated improvements (like using a colorimeter), provides strong evidence of a well-considered and thoroughly explored experimental plan from the outset.\n\nIn summary, while both essays are good, Essay B's superior detail, justification of choices, and proactive reflection on the experimental design make it the stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
