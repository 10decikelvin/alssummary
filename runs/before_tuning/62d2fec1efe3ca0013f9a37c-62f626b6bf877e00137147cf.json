  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more thorough experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Its research question is focused and clearly links the independent variable (type of acid catalyst) to the dependent variable (activation energy). The background information provides a solid theoretical foundation, correctly referencing the Arrhenius equation and explaining the rationale behind the hypothesis using pKa values. The methodology is detailed, logical, and repeatable, with a particularly strong section on variables that not only identifies them but also justifies the choices made for controlling them. The safety considerations are specific and appropriate.\n\nEssay B, while based on a reasonable research question, is significantly weaker in its execution. The introduction and background are almost non-existent, failing to explain the chemical principles behind complexometric titration or why calcium content might change over time. The methodology lacks critical details, such as the pH of the buffer, which is essential for an EDTA titration. Most importantly, it completely omits a dedicated discussion of independent, dependent, and controlled variables, which is a fundamental requirement for this criterion. While its risk assessment is adequate, the overall plan is underdeveloped and shows a less sophisticated understanding of experimental design compared to Essay A. Therefore, Essay A is substantially better.",
