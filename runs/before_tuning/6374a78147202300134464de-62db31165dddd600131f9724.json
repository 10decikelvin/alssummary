  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a higher quality of exploration, despite being partially incomplete in the provided text. Its primary strength lies in its outstanding background section, which provides rich scientific context by linking vitamin C to human health (free radicals, oxidative stress) and thoroughly explaining the chemistry behind both the degradation of ascorbic acid and the redox titration method used for its quantification. This justification of the chosen methodology is a hallmark of a strong investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's hypothesis is sophisticated, clearly stated, and justified with relevant chemical principles, including collision theory and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is supported by a diagram.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay A provides a competent background, including a strong link to thermodynamics with its Gibbs free energy calculation, its overall exploration is weaker. The personal introduction is generic, and the hypothesis is poorly formulated as a simple H\u2081/H\u2080 statement without immediate justification. Most critically, the risk assessment in Essay A contains a major flaw and contradiction, advising disposal of copper (II) sulphate \"down the drain\" while simultaneously stating not to dispose of hazardous chemicals in \"local waterways,\" demonstrating a significant lack of understanding of lab safety and environmental responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the depth of scientific understanding, superior contextualization, and stronger hypothesis formulation in Essay B's provided content make it the better essay, outweighing the completeness of Essay A, which is undermined by its weaker hypothesis and a critical safety error.",
