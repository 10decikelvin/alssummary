  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more thorough and well-structured exploration of its research question compared to Essay B. While both essays have clear research questions and provide relevant background information, Essay A's justification for its methodology is more detailed and integrated. For instance, it explains precisely why the Winkler titration method was chosen (\"the Winkler method is well known for its accuracy and can be performed with the available facilities and chemicals\") and provides the full set of chemical equations involved. Essay B's procedure, in contrast, is somewhat confusing and appears to be missing a table of concentrations for its calibration curve, making it harder to replicate. Furthermore, Essay A's consideration of safety and environmental issues is exemplary, using a detailed table that specifies hazards and first-aid measures for each chemical. Essay B's safety precautions are very brief and omit any mention of environmental considerations. Finally, the table of controlled variables in Essay A is slightly more robust, offering clearer justifications for why each variable needs to be controlled. Although Essay B includes a useful apparatus list which Essay A lacks, the overall quality, clarity, and depth of the methodology and safety considerations in Essay A make it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
