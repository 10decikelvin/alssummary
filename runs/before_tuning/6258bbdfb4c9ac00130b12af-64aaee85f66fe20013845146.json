  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B due to its depth, rigor, and comprehensive scientific planning. The research question in Essay A, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures...by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is highly focused and sets up a sophisticated chemical investigation. Its background information provides a strong theoretical foundation, explaining the chemical principles of hydrolysis and saponification with reaction diagrams, and directly linking them to the chosen analytical methods. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, including procedures for standardizing reagents, a dedicated \"Justification for methodology\" section, and even a preliminary experiment, all of which indicate a high level of forethought. Furthermore, its treatment of controlled variables is exemplary, using a table to not only list the variables but also explain precisely how and, critically, *why* they must be controlled.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B presents a viable and focused research question about caffeine content in tea, it lacks the scientific depth of Essay A. Its background information is more descriptive than explanatory, failing to delve into the chemical principles of liquid-liquid extraction or justify why dichloromethane is an appropriate solvent. The methodology in Essay B is a standard procedure but contains a significant unaddressed assumption: that the evaporated solid is pure caffeine. The controlled variables are reasonable, but the justifications are weaker; for instance, controlling the temperature to 35\u00b0C is explained only by the observation that \"bubbles to form\" rather than by its effect on solubility. Most notably, the risk assessment in Essay A is far more thorough, addressing specific chemical hazards, procedural risks like reflux, and including ethical and environmental considerations, whereas Essay B's safety section is brief and omits the critical environmental issue of disposing of a chlorinated solvent.\n\nOverall, Essay A showcases a much more advanced and well-considered experimental design, making it the clear winner for Criterion B.",
