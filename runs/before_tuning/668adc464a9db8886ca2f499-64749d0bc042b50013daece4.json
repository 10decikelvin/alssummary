  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a more focused and methodologically sound approach to the investigation, making it the stronger of the two for Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...reacting with blue food colouring...?\", is clear, concise, and investigates a single, well-defined relationship between one independent and one dependent variable. The background information is highly relevant, providing detailed chemical principles like the Beer-Lambert law, collision theory, and the redox chemistry of bleach, directly supporting the chosen methodology. A significant strength of Essay A is the inclusion of a \"Pre-Test\" section, where the student proactively determined the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach via titration, showing excellent practical problem-solving and planning.\n\nEssay B, while also strong in its scientific background and procedural detail, is fundamentally weakened by its research question: \"How does varying salinity...and temperature...affect the amount of dissolved oxygen...?\" This question includes two independent variables, which reflects a lack of focus in the experimental design. Although the student investigates them separately, a core component of the Exploration criterion is the formulation of a focused research question. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is slightly more elegant in its simplicity and directness using spectrophotometry, whereas Essay B's reliance on the multi-step Winkler titration, while technically demanding, introduces more potential points of procedural error. Essay A's control variables are also more robustly justified with direct links to kinetic theory. Therefore, Essay A's superior experimental design and sharper focus make it the better example of scientific exploration.",
