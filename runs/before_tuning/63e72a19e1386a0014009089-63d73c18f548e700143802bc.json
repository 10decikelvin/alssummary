  "reasoning": "Both essays present a strong fulfillment of the requirements for Criterion B. Both have clearly defined and focused research questions that explicitly state the independent and dependent variables with their respective units and ranges. The background information in both is detailed, relevant, and demonstrates a good understanding of the underlying chemistry.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a slightly more sophisticated level of engagement and planning. Its \"Development of Methodology\" section is particularly strong, as it not only explains the choice of variables but also justifies *why* this particular investigation was chosen over others, referencing a university-level experiment as its inspiration. This shows a higher degree of personal input and critical thinking in the design process. Furthermore, the theoretical background in Essay B, which includes a discussion of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and two different formulas for buffer capacity, shows a slightly deeper theoretical exploration.\n\nEssay A is very well-structured, with a clear procedure and a solid explanation of the Winkler titration chemistry. Its safety and controlled variables tables are thorough and well-justified. The main difference lies in the level of personal engagement evident in the planning phase. Essay B's justification for choosing the carbonate-bicarbonate system over the ideal carbonic acid system and its detailed rationale for selecting the specific variable ranges give it a slight edge in demonstrating a more considered and independently developed experimental design. Therefore, while both are excellent, Essay B shows a superior depth of planning and contextualization for the investigation.",
