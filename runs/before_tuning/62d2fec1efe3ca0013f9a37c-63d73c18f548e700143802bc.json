  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and sophisticated approach to the experimental design, meeting the criteria for the higher mark bands more effectively than Essay A.\n\nWhile both essays present clear research questions, Essay B's question is more complex and focused, demonstrating a deeper level of engagement with the topic of buffer solutions. The background information in Essay B is substantially more detailed and theoretically grounded, incorporating a discussion of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and two different formulas for buffer capacity, which provides a stronger justification for the chosen methodology.\n\nThe primary distinction lies in the experimental design. Essay B employs modern data-logging technology (pH probe, drop counter, PASCO software) which allows for highly precise and accurate data collection. This is a far superior method compared to Essay A's reliance on visual color change and manual timing with a stopwatch, a technique prone to significant random and systematic error. Essay B's methodology is more detailed, reproducible, and appropriate for the complexity of its research question.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's consideration of variables is more rigorous, and its risk assessment is presented in a clear, structured table format that is more comprehensive than Essay A's prose description. Although Essay A shows good self-awareness in its evaluation by identifying the limitations of its own method (e.g., using the naked eye, large burettes for small volumes), Essay B's initial design is inherently stronger and more likely to yield reliable and valid data.\n\nOverall, Essay B showcases a more advanced understanding of experimental design, variable control, and data acquisition techniques, making it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
