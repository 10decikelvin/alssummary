  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a more sophisticated and meticulously planned investigation. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying not only the variables and their ranges but also the exact measurement techniques (\"measured by a colorimeter set on a blue filter\"). The background section provides a thorough theoretical foundation, seamlessly connecting kinetics, the Arrhenius equation, and the Beer-Lambert law to the experimental design. Furthermore, the inclusion and detailed description of preliminary testing show a genuine process of methodological refinement, justifying choices like the temperature range and the decision to forgo cuvette caps. This iterative approach strengthens the validity of the final procedure.\n\nEssay B presents a competent investigation into a relevant real-world topic. The research question is clear, and the background information provides good context. The discussion of soot formation as qualitative evidence for incomplete combustion is a notable strength. However, the methodology relies on a simple calorimetry setup known for significant systematic heat loss, a major uncontrolled variable that impacts accuracy. While Essay B acknowledges this limitation in its evaluation, Essay A's design is inherently more precise and controlled from the outset. Additionally, Essay A's risk assessment is far more comprehensive, providing a detailed, chemical-by-chemical breakdown of hazards and mitigation strategies, which is superior to the more general safety notes in Essay B. Overall, Essay A's greater depth, methodological rigor, and clear evidence of preliminary refinement make it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
