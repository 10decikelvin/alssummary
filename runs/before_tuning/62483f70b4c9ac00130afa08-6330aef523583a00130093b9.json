  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more thoughtfully constructed exploration (Criterion B) than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is focused, investigative, and stems logically from a superb background section. This background connects a contemporary global issue (climate change) to the underlying chemistry (Le Chatelier's Principle), and then critically evaluates various analytical methods before settling on the Winkler titration, providing a clear justification for the chosen methodology. The experimental design is robust, with correctly identified variables, a detailed, step-by-step procedure, and specific considerations derived from preliminary trials, which indicates a high level of planning.\n\nEssay B, while theoretically ambitious, exhibits significant flaws in its experimental design. Most critically, the student incorrectly identifies the independent and dependent variables, stating \"Temperature change\" is the independent variable when it is clearly the dependent one. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design. Furthermore, the chosen methodology\u2014using very dilute solutions for calorimetry in a simple polystyrene cup\u2014was poorly conceived, a flaw the author later admits led to temperature changes that were too small to be meaningful. While the background provides a decent overview of thermochemistry with relevant Hess's Law cycles, it lacks the contextual depth and narrative justification seen in Essay A.\n\nUltimately, Essay A presents a complete and sound plan of investigation. Its methodology is appropriate, safe, and designed to collect the necessary data to address its well-developed research question. In contrast, Essay B's exploration is fundamentally flawed in its design, making it an inferior example of Criterion B.",
