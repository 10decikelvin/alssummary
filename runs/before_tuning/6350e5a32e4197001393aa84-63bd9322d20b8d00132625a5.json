  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a basic understanding of experimental design, but Student B's work is superior due to its more thorough and systematic approach to error analysis and suggestions for improvement. While both students identify relevant variables and propose a methodology, Student A's 'Evaluation' section is somewhat generic, whereas Student B's table of 'Limitations' provides a more structured and insightful critique of their experimental method. Student B clearly categorizes errors as systematic or random, explains their specific effect on the results, and offers concrete, practical suggestions for improvement for each identified limitation. For example, suggesting a 'copper calorimeter with a lid' directly addresses the heat loss issue. In contrast, Student A's suggestions are more general, such as 'Use clean water'. Furthermore, Student B's 'Extension' section is slightly more detailed and specific than Student A's. Therefore, due to the more rigorous and well-structured evaluation of the experimental design, Student B's work is considered stronger.",
