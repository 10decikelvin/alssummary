  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly more rigorous and chemically sophisticated approach to its investigation, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B despite a poorly worded research question. Its primary strength lies in the detailed and comprehensive methodology; for example, it correctly includes the crucial step of standardizing the sodium thiosulfate solution, a procedure essential for accuracy in titrations which Essay B omits entirely for its iodine solution. Furthermore, Essay A's risk assessment is exemplary, providing a chemical-by-chemical breakdown of hazards and specific precautions, such as noting that Potassium Dichromate \"Can cause cancer\" and should be handled in a fume hood. In contrast, Essay B's risk assessment is generic and its dismissal of environmental concerns as \"No significant environmental concerns\" is overly simplistic. While Essay B benefits from a clear and focused research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", Essay A's deep methodological detail and superior safety analysis showcase a higher level of scientific understanding and planning. The flaw in Essay A's research question, which confusingly mentions \"secondary data\" for a primary investigation, is a significant but ultimately superficial error when compared to the fundamental scientific omission in Essay B's procedure. Essay A's thorough background, which links local pollution context to the chemical principles of the Winkler method, further solidifies its standing as the more developed exploration.",
