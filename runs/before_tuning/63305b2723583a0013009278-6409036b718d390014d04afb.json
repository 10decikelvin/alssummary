  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and focused research questions. Essay A investigates a classic electrochemistry topic, clearly defining its variables and providing a solid theoretical background based on Faraday's laws. Its methodology is clear, repeatable, and includes good safety and environmental considerations. \n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of engagement and scientific inquiry. The chosen topic, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky oscillating reaction, is more complex and less common, indicating greater intellectual curiosity. The background information in Essay B is exceptionally thorough, linking the chemical principles to broader scientific concepts like cardiac arrhythmia. Most impressively, Essay B includes a dedicated section on the development of the methodology, discussing preliminary trials, challenges with equipment (e.g., switching from a colorimeter to a lux sensor), and the rationale for the chosen parameters. This showcases a more authentic and reflective scientific process. While both essays are strong, Essay B's depth, originality, and detailed justification of its experimental design make it superior.",
