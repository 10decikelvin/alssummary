  "reasoning": "The selection of Essay B as superior is based on its outstanding depth and rigor in methodology and safety considerations, which significantly outweigh its poorly formulated research question. Essay A presents a competent and solid investigation with a clear, albeit awkwardly phrased, research question and a strong theoretical background, notably using Gibbs free energy calculations to justify the reaction's spontaneity. However, its methodology is relatively simple, and its risk assessment is weak and contradictory, suggesting poor lab practice (\"disposed of the chemical solution... down the drain\").\n\nConversely, Essay B demonstrates a much more ambitious and technically complex exploration. While its research question is confusing and incorrectly mentions \"secondary data,\" the subsequent methodology is exceptionally detailed and showcases a high level of analytical chemistry skill. The procedure includes the preparation of all reagents from scratch and, crucially, the standardization of the sodium thiosulfate titrant, a critical step for ensuring accuracy that is often overlooked. Furthermore, Essay B's risk assessment is exemplary; it meticulously lists each hazardous chemical, its specific risks (\"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer\"), and the appropriate safety precautions, reflecting a professional approach to lab safety. The background information thoroughly explains the complex multi-step chemistry of the Winkler method, directly supporting the chosen procedure. In essence, the sheer quality, complexity, and thoroughness of Essay B's experimental design and safety protocols demonstrate a far deeper level of engagement and understanding of the scientific process, making it the better example of IB-level exploration despite the initial flaw in its research question.",
