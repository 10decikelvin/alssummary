  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more thoroughly planned investigation, making it the superior submission for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is focused, complex, and clearly outlines the scope of a sophisticated multi-day experiment. The background information is excellent; it accurately explains both the concept of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and the complex redox chemistry of the Winkler method, complete with relevant equations. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed and replicable, and its approach to variables is exemplary, particularly the comprehensive table of controlled variables that explains not just what is controlled but how it will be controlled. The safety and environmental considerations are outstanding, featuring a detailed, cited table of chemical-specific risks.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B has some strengths, such as calculating the Gibbs free energy to demonstrate reaction feasibility, it is undermined by a significant conceptual error. The background section incorrectly uses collision theory, which primarily explains reaction rates, to justify the effect of concentration on enthalpy change (a thermodynamic state function). The hypothesis is also confused, mentioning surface area which is not the stated independent variable. While the methodology is adequate for a standard calorimetry experiment, it lacks the complexity and thorough planning of Essay A. The discussion of controlled variables and safety is also less detailed than in Essay A. Therefore, due to its superior scientific context, more sophisticated methodology, and meticulous attention to variables and safety, Essay A is clearly the better essay.",
