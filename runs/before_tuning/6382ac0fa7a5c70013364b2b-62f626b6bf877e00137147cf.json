  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of Criterion B components: the research question, background, methodology, variables, and safety considerations. Essay A is demonstrably superior across nearly all of these aspects. Its research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources...as determined by two different methodologies,\" is focused, well-defined, and sets up a clear comparative investigation. The background provides relevant chemical theory, personal context for the choice of samples, and a connection to a real-world issue (ocean acidification), showcasing strong personal engagement and scientific context. In contrast, Essay B's research question is also good, but the provided text lacks any background information, starting abruptly with an incomplete procedural step.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A presents two complete, detailed, and replicable procedures for back titration and thermal decomposition, including a full materials list and solution preparation steps. Essay B's methodology is severely fragmented, beginning at step 6 and omitting crucial sample preparation details, making it impossible to replicate. Furthermore, Essay A excels in its identification and explanation of variables, presenting them in a clear table with justifications for how they were controlled for both experimental methods. Essay B completely omits any section defining or discussing its independent, dependent, or controlled variables. While both essays include a satisfactory risk assessment, Essay A's overall structure, clarity, and thoroughness in its experimental design make it a far stronger example of scientific exploration.",
