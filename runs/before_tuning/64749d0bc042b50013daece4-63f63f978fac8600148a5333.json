  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong grasp of the requirements for Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its more sophisticated rationale, focused research question, and refined methodology. Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels...\", is more focused than Essay A's, which investigates two separate independent variables (salinity and temperature). While Essay A handles this complexity well, Essay B's singular focus allows for a deeper exploration. Furthermore, Essay B's background and rationale are exceptionally strong; the student justifies the choice of an acidic pH range by referencing the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082, demonstrating significant preliminary research and chemical understanding. Essay B also includes a \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which is a hallmark of an excellent investigation, as it shows how the final procedure was developed and optimized. In contrast, while Essay A's background on Winkler's titration is thorough, the overall topic is more standard. Essay A's safety and disposal procedures are adequate, but Essay B's explicit mention of disposing of copper solutions \"in the appropriate heavy metals disposal area\" shows a higher level of environmental consideration. Finally, the control of variables in Essay B is justified with more sophisticated reasoning, such as linking temperature control to the autoionization of water and pectin stability.",
