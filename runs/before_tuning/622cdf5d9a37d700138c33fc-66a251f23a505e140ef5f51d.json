  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations, but Essay B is superior due to its greater theoretical depth, inclusion of preliminary work, and significantly more thorough consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. Essay A's research question is commendable for its creativity and for identifying a clear gap in existing literature, contrasting \"model foods\" with \"real food\". Its methodology is detailed and its table of controlled variables is excellent. However, its \"Risk Assessment\" is critically underdeveloped, as it only briefly mentions equipment hazards like the oven and glassware, completely omitting chemical safety, ethics, or environmental impact.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B demonstrates a more complete and rigorous exploration. Its background provides a robust theoretical framework, expertly linking the equilibrium constant (Kc) to Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and Le Chatelier's principle. The inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" is a hallmark of a high-quality exploration, showing how the student refined their methodology to address issues like reactant absorbance and reaction time. Most importantly, Essay B's \"Safety, ethical and environmental considerations\" section is comprehensive, discussing specific chemical hazards (e.g., \"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\" for potassium thiocyanate), outlining proper disposal, and addressing all three required aspects. While Essay A's topic is more original, Essay B's execution of all components of Criterion B is more thorough and scientifically rigorous.",
