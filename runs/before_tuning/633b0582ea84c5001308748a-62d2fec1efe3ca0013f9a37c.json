  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger than Essay A for Criterion B.\n\nThe research question in Essay B is focused, specific, and lends itself well to a scientific investigation that can be carried out in a school laboratory: \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\". In contrast, Essay A presents two related but distinct research questions, one of which (\"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\") is not practically feasible to investigate in a school lab and relies entirely on literature values.\n\nEssay B's background information provides a clear theoretical framework for the experiment, correctly linking reaction rates, catalysts, activation energy, and the Arrhenius equation. This demonstrates a solid understanding of the chemical principles involved. Essay A's background is also good, explaining the concepts of intermolecular forces and enthalpy of combustion, but it sets the stage for a data-mining exercise rather than an experiment.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant differentiator. Essay B outlines a detailed, logical, and appropriate experimental procedure, including specific concentrations, volumes, and equipment. The student clearly identifies and controls all relevant variables and demonstrates excellent awareness of the investigation's limitations by including a self-evaluation table with suggested improvements. Furthermore, Essay B includes a thorough and appropriate section on safety and environmental considerations, which is a key component of this criterion. Essay A's methodology section is critically flawed as it describes a data-collection exercise from online databases (\"The data will be collected through ChemPub and Chemeo\"), not a hands-on experiment. This approach lacks the personal engagement, design, and procedural considerations expected in an IB science IA and completely omits any discussion of safety, which is a significant weakness.\n\nOverall, Essay B presents a much more robust and well-considered scientific investigation that aligns perfectly with the requirements of Criterion B.",
