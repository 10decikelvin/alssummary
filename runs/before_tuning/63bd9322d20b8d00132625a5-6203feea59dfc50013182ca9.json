  "reasoning": "Both submissions exhibit strengths, but essay B demonstrates a slightly better understanding of the scientific process, particularly in its experimental design and data analysis. While both students present a clear hypothesis and methodology, essay B\u2019s rationale for the experiment feels more grounded in established scientific principles (linking pH to biological activity). The inclusion of a detailed method with specific chemical concentrations and a clear description of the titration process in essay B showcases a more thorough approach. Furthermore, the graph in essay B is correctly labeled and contributes effectively to the analysis, unlike the graph in essay A, which appears to show nearly zero change and has a misleading trendline based on only three data points. Although essay A\u2019s discussion of errors is more extensive, its lack of initial data for comparison makes it difficult to assess the validity of its conclusions. In contrast, essay B provides both initial and final measurements, allowing for a more complete analysis of the change in dissolved oxygen, which is central to the research question.",
