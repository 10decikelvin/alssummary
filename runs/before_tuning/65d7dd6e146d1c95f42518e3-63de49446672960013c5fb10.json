  "decision": "student a",
  "reasoning": "Both submissions aim to investigate the effect of temperature on vitamin B6, but Student A's work is superior due to its much stronger methodology and clearer understanding of experimental design. Student B's methodology is vague, lacking specific details like concentrations, volumes, or the method of analysis, making reproducibility impossible. While Student B provides a raw data table, the complete lack of a processed data section, including calculations for concentration, mean, or standard deviation, is a major flaw. In contrast, Student A details their entire experimental procedure, including the preparation of solutions, the use of a spectrophotometer, the specific wavelength measured, and the application of the Beer-Lambert law. Furthermore, Student A includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables and a detailed risk assessment, elements entirely missing from Student B's submission. Although both could improve by discussing the specific chemical reactions and breakdown products of vitamin B6 at high temperatures, Student A's work is substantially more rigorous and scientifically sound. Student B's lack of procedural detail and data processing demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of scientific investigation.",
