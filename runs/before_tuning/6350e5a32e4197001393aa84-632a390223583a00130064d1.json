  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate... affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is focused, specific, and clearly testable. The background information is thorough, providing relevant chemical theory on polymers, plasticizers, and the physics behind Young's Modulus, including the necessary equations. The methodology is exceptionally detailed and repeatable, with precise quantities, use of appropriate technology like a force sensor and Tracker software, and a clear step-by-step process. Most impressively, the identification of variables is exhaustive, presented in a clear table that not only lists controlled variables but also explains how they will be controlled and why, and even considers uncontrolled variables and their potential impact. In contrast, Essay A's research question is convoluted, attempting to simultaneously investigate the effect of salt concentration, different water sources, and two different measurement techniques (Winkler vs. probe), which lacks focus. While its background information is relevant, it fails to deeply explain the chemical principles of why salt concentration affects dissolved oxygen. Essay A's methodology is less precise, for example, it doesn't specify the exact salt concentrations to be tested. Although both essays include safety precautions, Essay B's consideration of ethical and environmental aspects is more nuanced and reflective, elevating its quality further.",
