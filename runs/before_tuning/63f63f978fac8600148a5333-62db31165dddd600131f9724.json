  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A presents a highly sophisticated and well-defined research question: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution... affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels...\". The rationale is excellent, grounding the investigation in real-world environmental issues and justifying the specific choice of an acidic pH range by referencing the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082 and gaps in existing literature. Its background section is comprehensive, detailing the chemical structures of orange peel components and linking them directly to the mechanisms of biosorption. The methodology is thorough, logical, and crucially, informed by preliminary trials that refined the procedure regarding contact time and pH limits.\n\nIn stark contrast, Essay B is fundamentally incomplete and lacks scientific depth. While its research question on Vitamin C degradation is acceptable, its rationale is generic and the background is superficial. The most significant weakness is the complete absence of a procedural methodology; it only offers a vague list of temperatures in the variables table without any step-by-step instructions on how the experiment would be conducted. Furthermore, the variables section in Essay B is poorly justified, simply stating the need \"to ensure a fair test\" without the detailed scientific reasoning provided in Essay A. Finally, Essay B entirely omits the required safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a major oversight. Essay A, therefore, presents a complete, well-researched, and thoughtfully designed exploration, while Essay B appears to be an unfinished draft lacking critical components and analytical depth.",
