  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and viable investigations. Essay A's research question is slightly more complex as it involves calculating a derived quantity (Young's Modulus) rather than just measuring a mass change. Essay B provides good personal context and a clear link to a real-world application (automotive plating).\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and rigorous approach to experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. The identification and management of variables in Essay A is outstanding. The table of controlled variables not only lists them but explains precisely how they will be controlled and why it's important, showing a deep understanding of the factors that could affect the outcome. Furthermore, Essay A's inclusion of *uncontrolled* variables demonstrates a sophisticated level of critical evaluation of the proposed method.\n\nWhile Essay B's methodology is sound, its control of variables is less detailed. For example, it lists \"Temperature of the solution\" but just states it was \"kept at room temperature,\" which can fluctuate. Key variables like the distance between electrodes and the surface area of the submerged portion of the nail are not mentioned. Essay A's use of technology like the LabQuest 2 sensor and Tracker software also suggests a more precise and robust data collection plan.\n\nFinally, both essays have good safety sections, but Essay A's inclusion of ethical considerations regarding the use of food materials adds another layer of depth. For these reasons, Essay A presents a more comprehensive and well-considered experimental plan.",
