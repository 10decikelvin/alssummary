  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the scientific process and experimental design required for Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and clearly links the independent variable (pH) to the dependent variable (mass of iron(II) extracted) through a specific analytical technique (titration). The background information is excellent, providing relevant chemical theory (redox reactions, solubility) and a clear justification for the choice of titrant concentration, supported by preliminary calculations. The methodology section is exceptionally well-structured, with a step-by-step procedure that is easy to follow and replicable, and the \"What was changed\" section shows critical reflection and refinement based on preliminary work. Furthermore, the identification and justification of controlled variables are specific and demonstrate a deep understanding of the factors affecting the reaction rate and equilibrium. Essay B, while covering the required components, is weaker in comparison. Its research question is less focused as it attempts to measure two dependent variables (Acid Value and Saponification Value), making the scope broader and potentially less manageable. The procedure is confusingly laid out, mixing preparation steps with the main experimental process, and some of the stated uncertainties (e.g., \u00b10.05\u00b0C for a standard thermometer, \u00b15.00 cm\u00b3 for a 500 cm\u00b3 measuring cylinder) are unrealistic, suggesting a weaker understanding of the equipment. While Essay B's evaluation of errors is present, Essay A's is more insightful, correctly identifying systematic versus random errors and proposing sophisticated, practical improvements.",
