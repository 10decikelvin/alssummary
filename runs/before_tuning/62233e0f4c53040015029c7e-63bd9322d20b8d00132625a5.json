  "reasoning": "The student has identified relevant environmental, ethical, and safety issues, although some are more pertinent than others.  For example, while mentioning the non-biodegradable nature of paraffin wax is valid, the immediate safety concern of an open flame is more critical to the execution of the lab. The proposed solution to use a fume hood for soot is practical. The suggestion of using a more precise electronic balance correctly identifies a source of random error and a reasonable improvement. The discussion of heat loss to the surroundings as a systematic error is standard and appropriate for this type of experiment. Acknowledging incomplete combustion as another source of systematic error demonstrates a good understanding of the experimental limitations. The extension ideas are simple but relevant to the investigation. Overall, this section shows a solid grasp of experimental design and error analysis.",
