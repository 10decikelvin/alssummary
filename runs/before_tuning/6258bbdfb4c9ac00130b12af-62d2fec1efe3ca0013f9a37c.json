  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of the Exploration criterion. Essay B is commended for its focused and well-phrased research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", which clearly links independent and dependent variables. The background information effectively connects concepts like pKa, rate laws, and the Arrhenius equation, demonstrating solid theoretical understanding. However, Essay A is superior due to its exceptionally thorough and well-justified methodology. It details not only the procedure but also the preparation and standardization of solutions, which shows a high level of chemical proficiency. The inclusion of a dedicated \"Justification for methodology\" section, explaining choices like temperature range and glassware, is a significant strength. Furthermore, Essay A's \"Controlled Variables\" table is more detailed and provides clearer reasons for control than Essay B's. The description of a preliminary experiment further underscores the meticulous planning process. While Essay B's plan is good, Essay A's demonstrates a more comprehensive and considered approach to the entire experimental design, from safety protocols to specific procedural choices, making it a stronger example for Criterion B.",
