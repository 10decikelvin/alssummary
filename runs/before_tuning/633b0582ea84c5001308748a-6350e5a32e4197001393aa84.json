  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more complete and thorough approach to Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen...?\", is well-defined and sets the stage for a robust hands-on investigation. The background information provides excellent chemical context, thoroughly explaining the principles of dissolved oxygen and the multi-step redox reactions of the Winkler method. The methodology is a significant strength, with clearly identified variables, a detailed, replicable procedure including specific concentrations, and the thoughtful inclusion of two distinct measurement techniques (Winkler titration and an oxygen probe) for comparison. Critically, Essay B excels in its comprehensive \"Safety, Environmental and Ethical considerations\" section, which addresses specific chemical hazards (e.g., \"Sulfuric is very corrosive\"), correct disposal procedures (\"disposed after neutralisation\"), and ethical points, fully satisfying this key component of the criterion.\n\nEssay A presents a well-structured database investigation with two clear research questions about the properties of alcohols. The background effectively connects the topic to real-world applications and explains the underlying chemistry of intermolecular forces and enthalpy of combustion. The methodology is appropriate for a database study, identifying credible sources and acknowledging necessary data processing steps like unit conversions. However, Essay A has a major omission: it completely lacks any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. While risks in a database IA are minimal, a student is still expected to acknowledge this explicitly (e.g., by stating that no chemicals were handled). This complete absence of a required component makes it significantly weaker than Essay B, which addresses this aspect in an exemplary manner. Therefore, due to its comprehensive methodology and its fulfillment of all aspects of the Exploration criterion, Essay B is the superior submission.",
