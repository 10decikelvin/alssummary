  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question is highly focused, complex, and appropriate for the IB Chemistry level, investigating reaction kinetics using a specific analytical technique. Its background section is exceptionally thorough, establishing a clear real-world context (azo dye pollution), demonstrating personal engagement, and detailing the complex chemical principles involved, such as the Photo-Fenton reaction and the scavenging effect, supported by literature citations. The methodology is meticulously designed, with well-justified variables, and impressively refined through preliminary trials, which demonstrates a high level of scientific thinking. In contrast, Essay B's research question is simpler and its background is adequate but lacks the depth and scientific rigor of Essay A. The most significant weakness of Essay B is a critical flaw in its methodology: it controls for the *mass* of the different salts rather than the number of *moles*. This fundamentally undermines the investigation's ability to test its hypothesis, which is based on the number of ions produced per formula unit (\"Van't Hoff factor\"). Furthermore, Essay A includes a clear and appropriate section on safety, sustainability, and ethics, while Essay B completely omits any mention of these crucial considerations.",
