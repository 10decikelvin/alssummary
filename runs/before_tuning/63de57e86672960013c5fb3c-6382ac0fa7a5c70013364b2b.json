  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its execution of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is highly focused, clearly defining the independent and dependent variables with specific parameters. In contrast, Essay B's research question is less focused, attempting to compare three different substances using two different methodologies simultaneously.\n\nEssay A's background section is comprehensive, effectively linking personal interest to established chemical principles like Faraday's laws of electrolysis and redox reactions, and even cites previous studies to contextualize the investigation. Essay B's background is adequate but less detailed, providing the basic reactions without the same depth of theoretical justification.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and identification of variables. Essay A presents a robust, replicable procedure with meticulous control of variables, explaining not only *what* will be controlled (e.g., distance between electrodes) but also *how* (\"using a wooden splint... marked with either end of the beaker\"). Conversely, Essay B has a major conceptual flaw, incorrectly identifying the \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable when it is in fact the *source* of the sample (chalk, rangoli, seashell). Furthermore, Essay B's procedure contains a critical error by using a measuring cylinder to take an aliquot for titration, a step that requires the precision of a pipette. Finally, Essay A's consideration of safety and environmental factors is more specific and detailed, particularly in its suggestions for chemical disposal, showcasing a higher level of thoroughness.",
