  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration (Criterion B) than Essay A. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its focused and well-defined research question: \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\u2082) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO\u2084 \u00b72H\u2082O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\". This question establishes a clear relationship between a quantifiable independent variable (MgCl\u2082 concentration) and a dependent variable (solubility), allowing for a genuine scientific investigation. In contrast, Essay A's research question is more of a comparative validation, testing three different substances with two different methods, which lacks a single, clear independent variable; the student incorrectly identifies \"Mass of sample\" as the IV, revealing a conceptual misunderstanding.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background is scientifically rich, demonstrating thorough preliminary research by explaining the \"diverse ion effect\" and citing charge densities, which provides a strong theoretical foundation for the investigation. Essay A's background is mostly anecdotal and provides a very weak scientific rationale, tenuously linking chalk analysis to coral reef bleaching. Methodologically, Essay B is superior, employing a sophisticated and appropriate technique (spectrophotometry) and demonstrating excellent planning by including a crucial calibration experiment. Essay A's methodology has significant flaws, such as using imprecise measuring cylinders for titrations and employing a Bunsen burner for thermal decomposition, a process the student themselves later admits requires a much higher temperature, fundamentally undermining that part of the experiment from the start. While Essay A has a more detailed safety and disposal section, this does not compensate for the profound weaknesses in its scientific focus, rationale, and experimental design when compared to the well-planned and scientifically sound exploration presented in Essay B.",
