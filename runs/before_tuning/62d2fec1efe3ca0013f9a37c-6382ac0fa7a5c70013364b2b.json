  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the requirements for the Exploration criterion. Its research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused, clear, and lends itself to a sophisticated investigation appropriate for the HL level. The background information is comprehensive, seamlessly connecting concepts like reaction rates, catalysis, acid strength (pKa values), and the Arrhenius equation to build a logical and scientifically sound foundation for the experiment. The methodology is detailed, replicable, and the variables are correctly identified and controlled. The student even shows higher-level thinking by considering and justifying their choice of temperature range to avoid evaporation.\n\nEssay B, while having a clear aim, presents a research question that is overly broad, attempting to compare both three different substances and two different methodologies. This lack of focus carries through to the background information, which is more descriptive than explanatory and lacks the theoretical depth of Essay A. The methodology in Essay B contains significant procedural flaws that undermine its validity, such as using a measuring cylinder to measure a precise volume for titration and relying on \"the same Bunsen Burner\" as a method for controlling temperature, which is inadequate. While Essay B has good safety considerations, the overall scientific rigour, from the conceptualization to the experimental design, is significantly weaker than that of Essay A. Essay A's plan is methodologically sound and rooted in a solid understanding of chemical kinetics, making it the superior example for this criterion.",
