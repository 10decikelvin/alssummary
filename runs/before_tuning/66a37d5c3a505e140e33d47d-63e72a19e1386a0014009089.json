  "reasoning": "Both essays present a strong foundation for a scientific investigation, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements for Criterion B. However, Essay B is superior due to its more thorough and scientifically rigorous background information and methodology.\n\nEssay A provides a good personal context for its research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature... of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration\". The background information is relevant, explaining the properties of Vitamin C and the principles of redox titration. The methodology is clear and replicable. However, listing \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable is confusing, as it is also being investigated as an independent variable alongside temperature.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration... affect the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration... in... tap water?\", is also well-focused. Its strength lies in its extensive background section, which meticulously explains the underlying chemistry, including the polarity of water, dipole-induced dipole forces, and the \"salting out\" effect, providing a robust theoretical basis for the hypothesis. The chosen methodology, the Winkler titration, is complex, and the procedure is detailed and broken down into logical steps. The identification and justification of controlled variables, such as atmospheric pressure and water source, demonstrate a more sophisticated awareness of potential confounding factors compared to Essay A. While both essays are commendable, Essay B's deeper dive into the chemical principles and more rigorous experimental design make it the stronger of the two.",
