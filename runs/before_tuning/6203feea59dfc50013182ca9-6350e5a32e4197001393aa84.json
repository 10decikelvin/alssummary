  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior exploration of its research question compared to Essay B, primarily due to its clarity, focus, and well-structured methodology. The research question in Essay A, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is sharply focused and directly informs every subsequent section. The background information is concise and highly relevant, providing the necessary scientific context for both Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and the Winkler method without extraneous detail. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is presented as a clear, logical, and repeatable sequence of steps, and its table of controlled variables is excellent, explaining not just *what* will be controlled, but also *how* it will be controlled (e.g., \"Using the same water sample for all three pH variations\").\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's exploration is weaker due to a lack of focus and clarity. Its research question introduces multiple variables (\"different water sources\" in addition to NaCl concentration), and the introduction adds a secondary, distracting goal of comparing the Winkler method to an oxygen probe. This diffusion of focus carries into the methodology, which is confusingly structured into non-sequential \"stages\" that are difficult to follow. While Essay B has a slightly more detailed environmental consideration section regarding acid neutralization, its variables section is significantly weaker than Essay A's, as it often fails to specify *how* variables will be controlled. Overall, Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more coherent experimental design, making it the better submission for Criterion B.",
