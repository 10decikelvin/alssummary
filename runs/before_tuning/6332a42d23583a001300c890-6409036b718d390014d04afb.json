  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and sophisticated approach to Criterion B. Its research question, while slightly wordy, investigates a more complex and original phenomenon (the BZ reaction), showcasing a higher level of intellectual curiosity. The background section in Essay B is particularly strong, not only explaining the relevant chemical principles but also including an excellent \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section which details the student's personal journey in designing the experiment, such as trialing different measurement devices before settling on the innovative use of a lux sensor. This justification of the methodology is a hallmark of excellent exploration. Furthermore, Essay B's handling of variables and safety/environmental considerations is exemplary; the controlled variables are presented in a comprehensive table with clear justifications, and the safety section includes specific mitigation strategies and a proactive decision to scale down the experiment to reduce environmental impact.\n\nWhile Essay A presents a very competent and well-structured investigation on a classic kinetics topic, it is less impressive in its exploration. The methodology relies on subjective visual timing (\"perception of the colour\") for data collection, which is a significant limitation compared to Essay B's objective data logging approach. Essay A's safety measures are also more generic (\"Very careful operations...\"). Although Essay A's plan to conduct five trials per temperature is a strength in its design for ensuring reliability, Essay B's overall depth of engagement, methodological problem-solving, and meticulous attention to control variables and safety make it the superior essay for Criterion B.",
