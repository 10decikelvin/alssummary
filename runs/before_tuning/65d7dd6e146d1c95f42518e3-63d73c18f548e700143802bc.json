  "reasoning": "Both submissions are identical and thus equally proficient. They both clearly state the research question and relevant background information. The methodology is well-explained, including the variables and control measures. The reference to the source of the method is a good practice. The inclusion of a risk assessment table is also a commendable feature, showing a thorough approach to experimental design. The result section, although only showing graphs and no raw data, seems appropriate for this kind of evaluation. Finally, the evaluation section is insightful, critically reflecting on the experiment's strengths and weaknesses and suggesting improvements. Overall, both submissions are well-structured, detailed, and reflect a strong understanding of scientific inquiry.",
