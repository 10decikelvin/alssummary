  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and relevant investigations. Essay A provides a clear, logical experimental plan with good identification of variables and safety considerations. The connection to a real-world problem (car restoration) is a nice touch. However, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of scientific engagement and depth. The student in Essay B not only formulates a focused research question but also details the preliminary work (titration) needed to determine the concentration of a key reactant, which shows excellent procedural foresight. Furthermore, the background section in Essay B is more comprehensive, referencing prior scientific literature and thoroughly explaining the underlying principles like the Beer-Lambert law and collision theory. While both methodologies are appropriate, the use of spectrophotometry in Essay B for a kinetics study is more sophisticated than the gravimetric analysis in Essay A. The discussion of variables and safety in both is strong, but the overall depth and proactive problem-solving in Essay B's methodology give it a clear edge.",
