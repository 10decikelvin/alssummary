  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and scientifically sound investigations appropriate for the IB Chemistry level. Essay B features a strong research question, relevant personal context, and solid background information, including the necessary balanced chemical equations for the neutralization reactions. Its methodology is clear, and the decision not to control the mass of the tablet is thoughtfully justified to reflect real-world application. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of mastery in several key areas of Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-focused, specifying the exact temperatures and juices to be tested. Its discussion of controlled variables is exemplary, using a detailed table to explain not only *what* will be controlled, but precisely *how* it will be controlled and *why* it is important, which shows a deeper understanding of experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A's section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is more nuanced and specific than Essay B's; for example, it thoughtfully addresses the ethical issue of food waste, a consideration directly relevant to its materials, whereas Essay B dismisses ethical considerations entirely. Finally, the inclusion of uncertainties for a wider range of apparatus in Essay A indicates a more meticulous approach to planning for precision. While Essay B is a very competent piece of work, Essay A's superior detail in experimental control and its more considered approach to the broader context of the investigation make it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
