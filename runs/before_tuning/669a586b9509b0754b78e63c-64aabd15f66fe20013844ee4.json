  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger performance on Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and detailed, specifying the exact concentrations, substances, and measurement parameters. The background information is thorough, linking the experiment to core chemical principles like collision theory and reaction mechanisms, including the intermediate formation of carbonic acid, which shows a sophisticated level of understanding. The methodology is exceptionally well-planned, evidenced by the inclusion of a pre-test to refine the experimental parameters, a comprehensive table for controlled variables that explains the 'what,' 'why,' and 'how' for each, and a meticulous approach to safety and environmental considerations, including waste minimization calculations.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B suffers from a significant methodological flaw that undermines its entire investigation. The research question aims to measure ascorbic acid concentration, but the chosen method\u2014acid-base titration with NaOH\u2014will neutralize all acids present in the orange juice (citric, malic, etc.), not just ascorbic acid. While the student correctly identifies this as a limitation later, a core part of Criterion B is designing an *appropriate* method, and this method is not appropriate for the stated goal. Furthermore, Essay B's safety section is minimal and dismissive (\"Gloves are not necessary...\"), and it completely lacks any discussion of environmental or ethical considerations. Although Essay B has good personal engagement and a clear structure, the fundamental mismatch between its research question and its experimental design makes it significantly weaker than Essay A.",
