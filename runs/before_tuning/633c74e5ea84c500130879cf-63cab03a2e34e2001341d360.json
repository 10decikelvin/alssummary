  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards, which assess the research question, background, methodology, variables, and safety considerations. Essay B is substantially stronger across nearly all of these aspects.\n\nFirst, Essay B's background research is far more thorough and focused. It effectively establishes the real-world context of water pollution by citing international agreements and detailing the ecological impact of depleted oxygen. It then meticulously justifies the selection of its four water sources as distinct levels of the independent variable (pollution), citing secondary research. Furthermore, Essay B provides the detailed chemical equations for the Winkler method, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying theory. In contrast, Essay A's background is superficial; it defines solubility but fails to explore the key chemical principles (like lattice vs. hydration enthalpy) that would explain why different anions or temperatures affect it.\n\nSecond, the methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, rigorous, and replicable. It includes precise instructions for preparing multiple complex reagents and, crucially, for standardizing the titrant\u2014a key step demonstrating strong procedural competence. Essay A's methodology is critically flawed and vague; for instance, it fails to state the volume of solvent used, a fundamental parameter needed to calculate solubility, making the procedure impossible to replicate.\n\nThird, Essay B clearly and correctly identifies its independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Essay A's variable section is confused, incorrectly listing \"Weight of the Salts\" and \"The Temperature of the System\" as two separate independent variables, when temperature is what is being measured (the dependent variable) at different concentrations.\n\nFinally, Essay B's risk assessment is exemplary. It provides a chemical-by-chemical breakdown of specific hazards and necessary precautions, and it explicitly addresses environmental disposal protocols. Essay A's safety section is generic and minimal, failing to mention the specific risks of the salts used and omitting environmental considerations entirely. While Essay A's research question is straightforward, its execution in the exploration phase is weak and lacks the scientific rigor and detail that Essay B demonstrates throughout.",
