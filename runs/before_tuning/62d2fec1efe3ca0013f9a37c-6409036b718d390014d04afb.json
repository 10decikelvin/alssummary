  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for a chemistry investigation. Essay A has a clear research question, relevant background information connecting reaction rates to the Arrhenius equation, and a logical hypothesis. However, its proposed methodology has significant limitations, such as using the naked eye to determine the reaction endpoint and employing large burettes for small volumes, which the author acknowledges leads to high uncertainty.\n\nEssay B is superior due to its significantly more sophisticated and well-considered experimental design. The author provides an excellent justification for the chosen methodology, detailing preliminary trials with different measurement tools (stopwatch, colorimeter) before settling on a lux sensor with a data logger for more objective and precise data collection. The background section is more in-depth, linking the BZ reaction to real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia, and demonstrating a deeper understanding of the complex reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the control of variables and the safety/environmental considerations are more thorough, including a proactive decision to scale down the experiment to reduce waste. This level of planning, justification, and attention to detail makes Essay B a stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
