  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, investigating how oil saturation levels affect the Maillard reaction, is more original, complex, and scientifically sophisticated than Essay A's standard caffeine extraction. The background section of Essay B is particularly strong; it is built upon a review of existing scientific literature (\"conducted by Toyosaki et al.\"), identifies a clear gap in the research (\"The usage of model foods limits the applicability... I decided to research how different oils... affected the Maillard reaction using real food\"), and provides a detailed chemical justification for its measurement technique (Beer-Lambert Law and wavelength selection). In contrast, Essay A's background is more descriptive, collecting general facts about tea, caffeine, and dichloromethane without deeply integrating them to build a strong scientific rationale.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is exceptionally detailed and demonstrates a rigorous approach to controlling variables. The procedure is broken down into logical sections (dough making, buffer preparation, AGE extraction), with precise quantities, times, and temperatures specified, showing a very high level of planning. The section on controlled variables is comprehensive and the justifications reveal a deep understanding of the complex biochemical system being studied. While Essay A presents a competent and replicable procedure with a good list of controlled variables, it does not reach the same level of meticulousness or demonstrate the same depth of chemical understanding as Essay B. For example, Essay B's preparation of a specific phosphate buffer from scratch showcases advanced laboratory skills and planning that far exceed the requirements of Essay A's procedure. Essay B's entire exploration is framed as a genuine scientific inquiry, whereas Essay A's feels more like a well-executed but standard school experiment.",
