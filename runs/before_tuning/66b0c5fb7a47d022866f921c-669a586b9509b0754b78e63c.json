  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B content and would likely score well. However, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of scientific rigor and depth in its exploration.\n\nEssay A's strengths lie in its clear research question, strong real-world context, and excellent justification of controlled variables in a well-structured table. A particularly insightful point is the justification for using kJ/g over kJ/mol due to the undefined composition of commercial fuel, which shows mature scientific thinking. The methodology is clear and replicable, with a good serial dilution plan.\n\nEssay B, however, is more thorough and meticulous. Its research question is exceptionally detailed, and the background information provides a deeper chemical explanation, including the formation of the carbonic acid intermediate, which goes beyond a standard textbook explanation. A major strength is the explicit mention and use of pre-testing to refine the range of the independent variable and the duration of the experiment; this is a hallmark of a well-planned scientific investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations is exemplary, presented in a detailed table that covers hazards, precautions, and disposal methods with specific justifications. While Essay A is very good, Essay B's comprehensive approach, narrative of refining its focus, and superior detail in its safety and methodology sections make it the stronger of the two.",
