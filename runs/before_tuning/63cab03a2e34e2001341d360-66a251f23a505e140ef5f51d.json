  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The most significant differentiator is the quality of the research question. Essay B presents a focused, clear, and quantitative research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\". In contrast, Essay A's research question is convoluted and contains a major contradiction, claiming to use \"secondary data\" while the methodology clearly describes a primary data collection experiment. While both essays provide relevant background information, Essay B's is far more sophisticated, connecting the investigation to fundamental thermodynamic principles like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation, which provides a much richer theoretical context than Essay A's discussion of environmental conventions.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology section is exemplary, featuring a \"Preliminary experiments\" section that demonstrates personal engagement and thoughtful refinement of the procedure. This is a hallmark of a high-quality exploration. Essay B also excels in its identification and justification of variables, using a detailed table that explains not only *what* will be controlled but also *why* and *how*. Essay A's methodology is detailed and its explanation of the Winkler method chemistry is a strength, but it lacks the evidence of personal development seen in Essay B. Finally, both have strong safety sections, but Essay B's goes a step further by discussing risk mitigation, such as avoiding the production of cyanide gas, which shows a deeper level of consideration.",
