  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in the depth and relevance of its background information and its meticulous approach to experimental design. The research question is sophisticated, exploring a quantitative relationship between multiple variables (protein/fat content and free Ca\u00b2\u207a/Mg\u00b2\u207a ions) across a diverse range of samples. The background section is exemplary, delving into complex concepts like casein micelles, chelation chemistry, and ionic equilibria with supporting diagrams and citations, which provides a robust scientific justification for the investigation. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of variables is outstanding; the detailed table of controlled variables explains not just *what* will be controlled, but *why* and *how*, and the inclusion of a separate section for uncontrolled variables shows a mature understanding of experimental limitations.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a solid and competent investigation on a classic topic, it falls short in comparison. Its background information is adequate but lacks the chemical depth and specificity of Essay A. The methodology has a potential flaw in titrating a sample while it is actively cooling, which could affect the consistency of the \"temperature\" variable. Most critically, Essay B contains a significant conceptual error by identifying \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable. In this experimental design, the type of juice is a second independent variable being compared, not a factor to be held constant. This error indicates a weaker grasp of experimental design principles compared to Essay A's flawless variable analysis. Therefore, due to its superior scientific context, depth, and rigorous planning, Essay A is the better submission.",
