  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is significantly better than Essay B in demonstrating the qualities of IB Criterion B: Exploration. Essay A presents a well-structured and scientifically rigorous plan. Its research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures...by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is focused, specific, and clearly outlines the independent variable (temperature with defined levels) and dependent variables (Acid Value and Saponification Value). The background information provides a thorough chemical context, explaining the reactions of hydrolysis and saponification. In contrast, Essay B's research question is awkwardly phrased, and its independent variable, \"expiration date,\" is poorly operationalized, leaving ambiguity in the experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is exceptionally detailed and justified. It includes procedures for standardizing reagents and conducting a preliminary experiment, which demonstrates a high level of planning. The controlled variables are not only identified but are accompanied by clear explanations of *how* they will be controlled and *why* this is important, as seen in Table 1 regarding \"Moisture\" and \"Microbial Contamination.\" Essay B's methodology is a simple list of steps lacking this justification, and while it identifies controlled variables, the method of control is less specific (e.g., \"Store all milk samples in the fridge at the same temperature\").\n\nFinally, Essay A's risk assessment is more comprehensive, presented in a structured table that addresses safety, ethical, and environmental aspects thoroughly. For example, it considers the flammability of oil at high temperatures and suggests keeping soil nearby to extinguish a potential fire. Essay B provides a reasonable list of safety precautions but omits any ethical considerations and is less detailed overall. Essay B also includes misplaced sections like \"Evaluation\" and uncertainty calculations, indicating a poorer understanding of the structure of the exploration section compared to the coherent and well-thought-out plan presented in Essay A.",
