  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures...by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is ambitious, well-defined, and leads to a sophisticated investigation appropriate for the IB level. The methodology is exceptionally thorough, outlining complex procedures like reflux and non-aqueous titrations, and includes the standardization of two separate titrants. A key strength is the \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains the reasoning behind choices like temperature range and sample size, showcasing deep critical thinking. Furthermore, Essay B's risk assessment is comprehensive, identifying specific chemical and procedural hazards and detailing appropriate safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a more standard investigation. While its research question is clear, the chosen methodology contains a significant flaw, which the student even identifies: using NaOH titrates all acids in the juice (citric, malic, etc.), not just the target ascorbic acid, which undermines the entire premise of the investigation. The background and variables are adequately covered, but the safety section is particularly weak, incorrectly stating that \"Gloves are not necessary\" for 0.05 M NaOH and completely omitting any ethical or environmental considerations. Therefore, Essay B is superior due to its greater complexity, more robust and well-justified methodology, and far more thorough consideration of all aspects of the exploration criterion.",
