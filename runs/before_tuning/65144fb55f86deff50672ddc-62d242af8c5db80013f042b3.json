  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a superior quality of exploration (Criterion B). Its research question is highly focused and directly investigates a core concept of transition metal chemistry\u2014d-orbital splitting\u2014which is very appropriate for the IB Chemistry syllabus. The background information provided in Essay A is exceptionally detailed, accurate, and relevant, showing a deep understanding of ligand field theory, the spectrochemical series, and the specific reactions involved, including potential side reactions. A key strength is the \"Assumptions\" section, where the student astutely identifies critical factors like the assumption of complete ligand exchange and consistent octahedral geometry, even foreshadowing a potential issue with the copper complex, which indicates a high level of critical thinking during the planning phase.\n\nEssay B, while having a clear research question and a well-structured methodology, does not exhibit the same depth of chemical understanding. The personal engagement feels slightly more superficial. Although the background on complexometric titration is adequate, the explanation of the indicator's mechanism is somewhat confusing. The procedure itself, a back-titration for calcium in milk, is ambitious and prone to significant interferences from the complex matrix of milk (proteins, fats), which the student acknowledges in their evaluation but perhaps underestimates in the planning stage. While Essay B's inclusion of a \"Comparison of Method\" section is commendable, Essay A's overall integration of advanced chemical principles into its planning and background sections makes it a more sophisticated and well-explored investigation.\n\nIn summary, Essay A is better because it is built upon a more solid and nuanced foundation of chemical theory, demonstrates more insightful and critical planning by anticipating specific chemical complications, and links its methodology more directly and clearly to the theoretical principles being investigated.",
