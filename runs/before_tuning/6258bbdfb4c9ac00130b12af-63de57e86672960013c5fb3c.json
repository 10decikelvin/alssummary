  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior mastery of the elements required for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exceptionally well-formulated: it is focused, precise, and posed as a proper question. This contrasts with Essay A's RQ, which is phrased as a lengthy statement (\"Investigating effect of heating on oil...\"). Furthermore, Essay B establishes a strong personal engagement and provides a well-researched background that includes citations to previous studies, adding academic depth. Essay A has a strong and complex methodology, but it is undermined by significant conceptual errors, such as listing a temperature uncertainty for a Soxhlet apparatus (\"100\u00b15\u00b0C\") and an unrealistic uncertainty for a thermometer (\"\u00b1 0.05\u00b0C\"). Essay B's methodology is clear, replicable, and its justification for variable choices (e.g., the voltage range based on jewellery-making advice) is excellent. While both essays have strong safety assessments, Essay B\u2019s environmental considerations are more specific and demonstrate a higher level of awareness regarding chemical disposal. Overall, Essay B presents a more polished, coherent, and scientifically sound exploration.",
