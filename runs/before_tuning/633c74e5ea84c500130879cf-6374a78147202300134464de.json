  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger performance for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is clear, focused, and appropriately scoped for an investigation. The background section is a significant strength, providing extensive and relevant chemical theory, including a calculation of the reaction's feasibility using Gibbs free energy and standard electrode potentials. Essay B also excels in its identification and control of variables, correctly outlining the independent (concentration), dependent (temperature change), and controlled variables in a clear table. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly complex by attempting to investigate two independent variables simultaneously. A major weakness for Essay A is its \"Variables\" section, which incorrectly identifies the weight of the salts as an independent variable and confuses the roles of temperature and crystallization points. While both essays propose appropriate methodologies, Essay B's is more thorough, including uncertainties for equipment and a clearer procedure. Finally, Essay B provides more specific and thoughtful safety and environmental considerations, noting the toxicity of the chemicals and their proper disposal, whereas Essay A's safety precautions are generic.",
