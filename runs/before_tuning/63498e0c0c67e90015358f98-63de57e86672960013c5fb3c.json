  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior to Essay A across multiple facets of Criterion B. Essay B's personal engagement, stemming from an interest in jewellery making, provides a clear and authentic narrative that logically progresses to the research question about electroplating. Its background research is more comprehensive, not only explaining the underlying principles of electrolysis and Faraday's Law but also citing multiple previous studies, which firmly grounds the investigation in existing scientific context. In contrast, Essay A's background is adequate but less thorough, and its methodology contains a significant scientific flaw: it proposes making a 0.6M stock solution of CaSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O, which is impossible as the compound is sparingly soluble with a solubility around 0.012 M. This fundamental error undermines the entire experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its planning and attention to detail. The controlled variables, such as the distance between electrodes and surface area, are thoughtfully considered with practical and effective control measures described. For example, \"a wooden splint placed across the beaker... is marked... to ensure the same distance between the electrodes in each trial.\" Perhaps the most significant difference lies in the treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. Essay B provides an exemplary risk assessment, identifying specific chemical hazards (H\u2082SO\u2084, CuSO\u2084) and outlining detailed disposal methods that show a genuine concern for environmental impact, such as neutralizing the acid and mixing copper sulfate with sawdust. Essay A's safety precautions are minimal, and it completely omits any discussion of environmental impact, which is a notable weakness. While Essay A has a good structure and a clear research question, the combination of a flawed procedure and a weak SEE section makes it significantly weaker than Essay B.",
