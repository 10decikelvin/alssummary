  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\", is exceptionally focused and clearly defines all parameters, including concentrations, the independent variable range, and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", is overly broad, vague, and attempts to tackle two independent variables without sufficient focus.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background section provides a thorough and relevant theoretical foundation, explaining the reaction mechanism, Beer-Lambert Law, and the Arrhenius equation, which directly underpins the entire investigation. Essay B's background is superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility and failing to delve into the key concepts like lattice enthalpy and hydration enthalpy that would be necessary to properly explain the phenomenon under investigation.\n\nThe methodology in Essay A is meticulous. The variables are not just listed but are justified and the method of control is explained in detail. The inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section is a hallmark of a well-planned investigation, as it shows the student refined their procedure based on pilot experiments. Essay B's methodology is confusing and lacks crucial details; for example, the procedure states \"Five samples of each salt were taken according to the calculation of the solubility,\" which is circular reasoning for an experiment designed to find solubility. The variables in Essay B are also poorly defined, with \"Weight of the Salts\" listed as an independent variable without clear context.\n\nFinally, Essay A presents a comprehensive and specific safety assessment, addressing the hazards of each chemical used. Essay B's safety precautions are generic and lack specific details about the salts being used. Overall, Essay A exemplifies a well-researched, methodologically sound, and clearly articulated scientific exploration, making it far superior to Essay B.",
