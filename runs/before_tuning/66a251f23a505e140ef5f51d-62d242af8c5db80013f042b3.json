  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question is sharply focused and directly addresses a core concept in the IB Chemistry syllabus. The background information is outstanding, providing a detailed and accurate theoretical framework that masterfully connects equilibrium, Gibbs free energy, Le Chatelier's principle, and the Van't Hoff equation. A key strength of Essay A is the inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments,\" which shows a sophisticated, iterative approach to methodological design, identifying and solving problems like interference from Fe\u00b3\u207a ions before the main experiment. The variables are impeccably detailed in a table that not only lists them but also provides clear explanations for *why* and *how* each is controlled. The procedure is logical, detailed, and easily reproducible.\n\nEssay B, while based on an interesting and personally engaged topic, is weaker in its scientific foundation and methodological clarity. The background explanation of the complexometric titration chemistry is confused and contains inaccuracies, particularly regarding the role of the EBT indicator. The research question lists different temperature values than the variables table, showing a lack of attention to detail. While the controlled variables are numerous, the table format lacks the crucial justification for *why* they need to be controlled. Although Essay B has a very strong \"Limitations and Improvements\" section that shows excellent critical thinking about the procedural challenges, this does not compensate for the foundational weaknesses in the scientific explanation and the inconsistencies within the proposed methodology.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a far more coherent, scientifically rigorous, and well-planned investigation, making it the superior example for Criterion B.",
