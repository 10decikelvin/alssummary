  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created,\" is highly focused, complex, and demonstrates significant personal engagement by identifying a specific gap in existing literature (real food vs. model food). The background information is detailed and scientifically rigorous, adeptly explaining the chemistry of the Maillard reaction, Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), and the principles of colorimetry via the Lambert-Beer Law. The methodology is sophisticated, precise, and replicable, involving complex procedures like preparing a phosphate buffer to a specific pH and molarity, which is far beyond a standard high school experiment. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables is exhaustive and provides clear justifications for why each variable must be controlled.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B presents a much simpler investigation with notable flaws. While the research question is clear, the topic of salts melting ice is very common. The background information is adequate but covers basic syllabus-level concepts without the depth seen in Essay A. The methodology has a critical design flaw: it uses equal masses (5 grams) of different salts rather than an equal number of moles, which undermines the investigation of colligative properties, as the freezing point depression formula is based on molality. Additionally, the method fails to specify how the \"identical ice cubes\" will be controlled for initial mass or volume, a crucial uncontrolled variable that directly impacts the dependent variable. Finally, Essay B completely omits any form of risk assessment, which is a required component of this criterion. Essay A's inclusion of safety protocols, though brief, makes it more complete. Overall, Essay A exemplifies a high level of scientific inquiry and meticulous planning, whereas Essay B's exploration contains fundamental methodological weaknesses.",
