Let'light begin by stating the context that both responses are trying to discuss the relationship between the number of variables manipulated and the time taken for all reactions to occur using an Alka-Seltzer lab scenario as an assessment piece. The rubric mentions two factors: the quantity of reactant (amount of Alka-Seltzer) and water temperature. The top response clearly describes how the experiment could be designed with two experiments, one for each factor, with detailed procedures for ensuring sufficient relevant data collection.
