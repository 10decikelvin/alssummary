  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly more thorough and complete approach to Criterion B. Its research question is twofold, focused, and set within a compelling personal and global context of sustainable energy, which strongly addresses the \"why\" of the investigation. The background information is comprehensive, effectively linking concepts like intermolecular forces, enthalpy of combustion, and octane ratings to the central question of fuel efficiency. The methodology is outstanding for a database investigation; it not only identifies credible, specific sources like NIST and HSDB but also thoughtfully details how data inconsistencies (ranges, units) will be processed, showing clear foresight. Furthermore, Essay A excels in its identification and justification of variables, particularly the control of using only \"linear primary alcohols\" to ensure a valid comparison.\n\nEssay B, while having a clear research question and a solid personal connection, is critically underdeveloped in key areas. The background information effectively explains the chemistry of the titration, but the essay's methodology section is a major weakness. It describes the chemical principle of the titration but provides no actual experimental procedure, such as the temperatures to be tested, heating method, volumes, or number of trials. The variables are implied in the hypothesis but are not explicitly laid out in the provided table, and crucial controlled variables are missing. Most importantly, there is a complete omission of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a significant flaw for a laboratory-based investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A presents a complete, well-reasoned, and meticulously planned exploration. In contrast, Essay B feels incomplete, failing to provide the necessary detail in its methodology, variable control, and safety considerations, making Essay A the clear superior.",
