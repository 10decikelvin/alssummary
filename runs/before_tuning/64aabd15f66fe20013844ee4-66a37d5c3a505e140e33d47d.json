  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much stronger and more chemically sound exploration of its research question. The primary reason for this is the choice of methodology; Essay B correctly employs a redox titration with iodine, which is specific to the reducing properties of ascorbic acid. This is the standard, accepted method for this type of analysis. In contrast, Essay A uses an acid-base titration with NaOH, a fundamentally flawed approach because NaOH will neutralize all acids present in the juice (like citric and malic acid), not just ascorbic acid. Essay A's student even acknowledges this fatal flaw in their limitations section, stating, \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH... A better titrant would have been Iodine.\"\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature...of various citrus juices...and their vitamin C...concentration,\" is more analytical and sophisticated than Essay A's question, which is a simple comparative ranking. Essay B's methodology is also far more detailed and rigorous, including instructions for preparing the standard solutions from scratch, which shows a higher level of engagement. Finally, Essay B's section on safety, ethical, and environmental issues is comprehensive and thoughtful, addressing specific risks like the heating plate and iodine, as well as considering food waste and energy consumption. Essay A\u2019s safety section is dismissive and incomplete, failing to address any ethical or environmental points.",
