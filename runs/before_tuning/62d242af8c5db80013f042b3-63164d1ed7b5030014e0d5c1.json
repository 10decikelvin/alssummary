  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and viable investigations appropriate for the IB Chemistry level. Essay B outlines a classic and clear experiment on vitamin C titration, with a focused research question, relevant background information, and a logical method. It also includes a solid risk assessment and identifies pertinent limitations, such as the natural variation in vitamin C content between individual peppers.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of thoroughness and complexity in its exploration. The research question involves a more sophisticated analytical technique, back titration with EDTA, which is well-explained in the background section. The standout feature of Essay A is its exceptionally detailed and organized \"Variables\" section; the use of a table to explicitly state how each variable is controlled and, crucially, *why* it needs to be controlled, shows a superior understanding of experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A includes a \"Comparison of Method\" section, which justifies the choice of complexometric titration over other advanced techniques like FAAS, demonstrating a deeper level of research and critical thinking about the methodology. While Essay B is a strong and competent piece of work, Essay A's meticulous planning, justification of methodological choices, and more complex chemical principles make it the superior example for Criterion B.",
