  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement and understanding across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and sophisticated, clearly defining the quantitative relationship between the concentration ratio of a conjugate acid-base pair and the resulting buffer capacity. The background information in Essay B is comprehensive, chemically accurate, and directly relevant, incorporating complex concepts like the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and formulas for buffer capacity to build a strong theoretical foundation. In contrast, Essay A's research question is simpler, and its background contains a significant chemical error regarding the structure of caffeine and relies on a weak, subjective hypothesis (\"I always have a heightened level of alertness and concentration after drinking this tea\").\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is far superior. It includes a \"Development of Methodology\" section, showing thoughtful consideration and adaptation from existing literature, and employs modern data-logging tools (pH probe, drop counter) for precise measurements. Essay A's methodology has a fundamental flaw in its quantification step; assuming the evaporated residue from a dichloromethane extraction is pure caffeine is a major oversimplification that compromises the validity of the results. Finally, Essay B presents a thorough risk assessment table that addresses safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, whereas Essay A only provides basic safety notes and completely omits any discussion of environmental or ethical impacts, particularly concerning the disposal of the hazardous solvent dichloromethane.",
