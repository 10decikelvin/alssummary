  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is clear, focused, and appropriately framed for a scientific investigation. Essay B provides extensive and relevant background information, establishing both personal and scientific context by discussing the role of antioxidants, the chemistry of ascorbic acid oxidation, and the specific principles of the chosen redox titration method. In contrast, Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased, and its background section is extremely superficial, merely defining titration in a single sentence without explaining the specific chemistry of complexometric titration with EDTA or its relevance to measuring calcium in milk.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels by presenting a detailed, well-reasoned hypothesis grounded in established chemical principles like collision theory and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic. Essay A lacks a formal hypothesis and its methodology is presented as a simple list of steps without justification for the choice of reagents or procedures. While Essay A does include a solid risk assessment, which is a key component of this criterion, the overall quality of its exploration is weak. Essay B's comprehensive theoretical foundation and clear, contextualized planning make it a much stronger example of Criterion B, showcasing a student who has thoroughly researched and understood their investigation before beginning.",
