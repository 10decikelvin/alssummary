  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior exploration of its topic, positioning it as the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in the highly focused and well-justified research question: \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\". The student justifies this question by identifying a gap in the scientific literature, demonstrating significant personal engagement and independent thinking. In contrast, Essay B's question about the effect of temperature on a reaction's rate constant is a very standard kinetics investigation, offering less scope for originality.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its detailed planning and control of variables. The use of a table to explicitly outline each controlled variable, its potential effect on the results, and the specific method of control is exemplary. For instance, it explains *why* pH must be controlled for the Eriochrome Black T indicator to work effectively. Essay B identifies its controlled variables, but the justification is less thorough and more focused on general lab technique (e.g., \"swirling conical flask\") rather than the underlying chemical principles.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is rich and directly relevant, discussing complex concepts like casein micelles and the chelation of ions, which provides a robust scientific context for the investigation. Essay B's background is competent in deriving the necessary kinetic equations but is less comprehensive. Finally, Essay A\u2019s risk assessment is more thorough, including a thoughtful environmental consideration about product packaging that goes beyond simple chemical disposal. While Essay B outlines a methodologically sound and classic experiment, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking, personal engagement, and meticulous experimental design.",
