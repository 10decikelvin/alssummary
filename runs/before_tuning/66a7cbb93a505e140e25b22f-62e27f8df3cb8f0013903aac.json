  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher quality of exploration and is the stronger of the two submissions. Its research question is highly focused and sophisticated, aiming to determine a specific physical constant (activation energy) by manipulating temperature and measuring reaction rates. The background information is comprehensive, expertly weaving together concepts from kinetics, spectroscopy (Beer-Lambert Law), and thermodynamics (Arrhenius equation) to build a robust theoretical framework for the investigation. This level of detail is superior to Essay A, whose background on neutralization is correct but much more fundamental.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is its greatest strength. The student provides meticulous detail on the control of variables, justifying each choice with clear scientific reasoning. For instance, the rationale for the temperature range is explicitly linked to preliminary testing: \"These specific temperatures were Selected as from preliminary testing, the reaction at 70\u00baC was too quick... Although propanone has a boiling point of 54\u00baC, this was not an issue as propanone was not being heated directly.\" This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. In contrast, Essay A makes a questionable choice not to control the mass of the antacid tablets, justifying it on \"realistic\" grounds, which undermines the scientific validity of comparing the chemical effectiveness of the active ingredients directly.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are far more detailed and specific, identifying the risks associated with each chemical and outlining precise mitigation and disposal procedures. Essay A's safety section is generic and less thorough. Finally, the procedure in Essay B is complex but clearly articulated, showing a well-planned and replicable experiment. Essay A's procedure is simpler and contains potential ambiguities, like the lack of a defined endpoint other than a color that \"remains after one minute.\" Overall, Essay B showcases a much deeper engagement with the scientific process, from conceptualization through to detailed planning.",
