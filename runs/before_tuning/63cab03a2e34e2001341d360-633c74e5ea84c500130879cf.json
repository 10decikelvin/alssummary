  "reasoning": "The reasoning for this decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards, which include the research question, background, methodology, variables, and safety considerations.\n\nEssay A demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and detail, despite a poorly worded research question. The background information is excellent; it effectively connects a global environmental issue to a specific, local context, justifying the choice of water bodies with secondary data and citations. Furthermore, the detailed explanation of the Winkler titration chemistry, complete with balanced equations, provides a strong theoretical foundation. The methodology is exceptionally thorough, outlining not just the titration procedure but also the preparation and standardization of all necessary reagents, which shows a sophisticated level of planning. The risk assessment is exemplary, identifying specific hazards for each chemical and outlining appropriate, specific safety precautions, in addition to mentioning environmental disposal protocols.\n\nEssay B, while based on a valid scientific concept, is significantly weaker in its execution. The research question is overly ambitious for an IA, attempting to investigate two independent variables (\"polyatomic anion\" and \"temperature\") simultaneously, which complicates the experimental design and focus. The section on variables is fundamentally flawed, incorrectly identifying the independent and dependent variables, which indicates a misunderstanding of the experimental design. For instance, it lists \"The Temperature of the System\" as an independent variable when it is actually the dependent variable being measured. The safety section is generic and inadequate, failing to specify the hazards of the particular salts used, and it completely omits any environmental considerations. While the use of data-logging software is a strength, the overall methodology lacks the clarity and detail seen in Essay A.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A presents a well-researched, meticulously planned, and safe investigation that is firmly grounded in chemical principles. Its minor flaw in the research question's wording is far outweighed by its overwhelming strengths in methodology, background research, and risk assessment. Essay B's conceptual flaws, particularly in the identification of variables and its superficial safety analysis, make it a much weaker example of scientific exploration.",
