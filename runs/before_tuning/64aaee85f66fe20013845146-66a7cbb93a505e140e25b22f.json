  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach to the exploration criteria. Its research question, \"How do different active ingredients... compare in the volume (cm\u00b3) of 1M HCl they can neutralise through acid-base titration?\", is exceptionally clear and focused, precisely linking the independent and dependent variables. The background information is a significant strength, as it not only explains the context of indigestion but also provides the specific balanced chemical equations for each antacid's reaction, demonstrating a high level of chemical understanding. In contrast, while Essay A's research question is functional, it is less concise. Essay B also excels in its comprehensive treatment of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, providing specific details for each category, whereas Essay A only briefly touches on safety and omits the other two aspects entirely. Furthermore, Essay B's justification for not controlling the mass of the tablet (\"to give a realistic answer, the mass of each tablet will be kept as is\") shows a thoughtful engagement with the real-world context of the investigation. While Essay A presents a solid methodology and clear variables, Essay B's superior background chemistry, sharper research question, and more complete consideration of safety and environmental factors make it the better example of Criterion B.",
