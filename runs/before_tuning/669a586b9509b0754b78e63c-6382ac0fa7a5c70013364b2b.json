  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration than Essay B. The research question in Essay A is highly focused and detailed, specifying all key parameters of the investigation, which sets a strong foundation. Essay A's background section is exemplary, not only providing relevant chemical theory (collision theory, neutralisation reactions) but also documenting a crucial part of the scientific process: refining the research question based on preliminary tests. This justification for changing from pH to concentration shows a high level of student engagement and methodological development. Furthermore, Essay A's identification and justification of controlled variables are meticulous, with a clear table explaining the \"what,\" \"why,\" and \"how\" for each, showcasing a deep understanding of experimental design.\n\nEssay B, while having an interesting research question that compares two methodologies, falls short in its execution. The background information is superficial, providing reaction equations but lacking depth on the theory behind back titration or thermal decomposition. The methodology contains significant flaws; for example, using a measuring cylinder instead of a pipette for taking an aliquot for titration is a major procedural error affecting precision. More critically, the thermal decomposition method using a Bunsen burner for a fixed time is scientifically inappropriate, as a Bunsen flame cannot reliably provide the high, stable temperature required for complete decomposition, a weakness the student only acknowledges in the evaluation rather than addressing in the design. The control of variables in Essay B is also less rigorous, with weak justifications like using the \"same Bunsen Burner\" to control temperature.\n\nIn summary, Essay A presents a well-conceived, thoroughly justified, and scientifically sound experimental plan. In contrast, Essay B's plan contains notable methodological weaknesses and lacks the depth of theoretical and practical justification demonstrated in Essay A.",
