  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating a clear understanding of the scientific process. Essay B is commended for its detailed risk assessment, which provides specific and practical safety precautions for handling a hot plate and iodine solution, surpassing the more generic safety notes in Essay A. Essay B also has a very clear background that logically connects personal interest to the scientific principles of redox titration.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior overall due to its exceptional level of detail and justification in its experimental design. The research question is well-supported by a background that connects to complex, real-world issues like fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. The variables section in Essay A is a significant strength; the choice of concentrations for the independent variable is meticulously justified with real-world context (\"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia... E85 is an exception to this and has been used due to the real-world context\"). This contrasts with Essay B, which later admits in its evaluation that the chosen time intervals were a limitation. Furthermore, Essay A's use of a clear table for controlled variables, with separate columns for \"Why\" and \"How,\" demonstrates a more rigorous and structured approach to controlling the experiment. The methodology in Essay A, including a pre-calculated serial dilution table, also reflects a more thorough and precise planning phase.",
