  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior exploration (Criterion B) due to its exceptional clarity, focus, and scientific process. The research question in Essay A is a model of precision, clearly defining all variables, quantities, and conditions: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids...in HCl solutions of varying concentrations...measured through the production of CO2 (cm^3) in 2 minutes?\". In contrast, Essay B's research question is framed as a topic, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil...\", and lacks the specificity of Essay A's. Furthermore, Essay A's inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section is a significant strength, as it demonstrates a thoughtful refinement of the methodology and justifies the final choice of concentrations and time frame. While Essay B also conducts a preliminary experiment, Essay A's pre-test is better integrated into the development of the final procedure. Both essays thoroughly address variables and safety, but Essay A's tables are slightly more detailed, including hazard symbols and specific disposal instructions (\"disposed of through the sink after further dilution\"). Essay B's exploration is ambitious and chemically complex, but it is slightly weakened by a less-focused research question and an admission that a hypothesis could not be formed for the saponification value, indicating a minor gap in the background research. Therefore, Essay A's cohesive and meticulously planned investigation makes it the stronger submission for this criterion.",
