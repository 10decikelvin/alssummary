  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in the exceptional detail and thoroughness of its experimental design. The methodology is meticulously outlined, providing specific quantities, concentrations, and step-by-step procedures for chemical preparation, sample heating, and two distinct titration methods (for acid and saponification values). This level of detail, including a \"Justification for methodology\" section, makes the experiment highly replicable. Furthermore, Essay A excels in its treatment of variables, presenting a comprehensive table of controlled variables that not only identifies them but also explains precisely how and why each one must be controlled. The inclusion of a preliminary experiment and a detailed, tabulated risk assessment covering safety, ethical, and environmental concerns showcases a masterful and holistic approach to scientific exploration.\n\nEssay B, while strong in its own right, falls short in comparison. It presents a compelling introduction with excellent real-world context and personal engagement, and its research questions are clear and focused for a database investigation. The background information is also relevant and well-explained. However, its methodology, while appropriate for a database IA, lacks the depth and complexity demonstrated in Essay A. The most significant weakness, and the deciding factor, is the complete omission of any section on safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. Even for a database study, acknowledging the absence of direct risks is expected. This oversight represents a critical failure to address a key component of Criterion B, making Essay A the clear winner.",
