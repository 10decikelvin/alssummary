  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated and thorough exploration of its research topic, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its research question, while lengthy, delves into a more complex and original area of food chemistry, investigating the \"effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction.\" The background section is particularly impressive, as it not only explains the Maillard reaction but also adeptly links it to advanced glycation end products (AGEs), colorimetry, and the Lambert-Beer law, demonstrating a deep conceptual understanding. Furthermore, Essay B identifies a specific gap in the existing literature\u2014the lack of research on real foods versus \"model foods\"\u2014which is a hallmark of a high-quality scientific exploration. The methodology is intricate, involving the preparation of a specific phosphate buffer from raw chemicals, a multi-step dough-making process, and a precise extraction and analysis procedure, all of which are detailed enough to be replicable.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a solid but more standard investigation into the enthalpy of combustion of gasohol. While its structure is clear and the variables are well-justified (e.g., the reasoning for using kJ/g is a nice touch), the scientific scope is less ambitious than that of Essay B. The background information is relevant but does not display the same depth of research or synthesis of complex ideas. A minor inconsistency was also noted in Essay A's methodology regarding the target temperature change. While Essay A has a more comprehensive risk assessment that includes environmental considerations, Essay B's superior scientific rigor, originality, and detailed experimental design ultimately make it the better example of Criterion B.",
