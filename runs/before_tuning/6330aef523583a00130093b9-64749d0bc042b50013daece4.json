  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough exploration of its research topic compared to Essay A. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its meticulous and comprehensive experimental design. The research question, \"How does varying salinity...and temperature...affect the amount of dissolved oxygen...in a distilled water sample,\" is sharply focused and leads to a well-structured investigation. The justification for choosing the Winkler titration method over alternatives shows excellent background research and critical thinking. Most impressively, Essay B provides an exemplary treatment of variables; the independent, dependent, and a comprehensive list of controlled variables are not only correctly identified but are also justified with clear chemical principles and specific methods for their control.\n\nEssay A, while commendable for its ambitious and theoretically complex research question about hydration enthalpies, exhibits fundamental flaws in its experimental design. A critical weakness is the incorrect identification of variables, stating \"Temperature change\" as the independent variable and \"Different types of substances\" as the dependent variable, which is the reverse of the actual experimental setup. This indicates a misunderstanding of basic experimental principles. Furthermore, its initial procedure is overly simplistic for a calorimetric experiment, failing to account for heat loss through methods like extrapolation, a flaw the student only acknowledges after the experiment failed to yield usable data.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's procedure is detailed, replicable, and shows a clear understanding of the nuances of the technique, such as adding reagents \"under the surface of the water\" to prevent atmospheric contamination. Essay B also provides a more detailed and specific table for safety and chemical disposal. While Essay A's theoretical background on Hess's cycles is strong, Essay B's combination of a strong rationale, clear hypothesis supported by literature, and a virtually flawless experimental plan makes it a superior example of Criterion B. The planning in Essay B is proactive and thorough, whereas the planning in Essay A is flawed and requires reactive troubleshooting, which is detailed in its evaluation section.",
