  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger in its exploration. Its research question, \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2...\", is highly focused, complex, and clearly defines the scope of the investigation. The background information is outstanding; it not only provides relevant chemical theory like the Photo-Fenton reaction and Beer-Lambert Law but also establishes a compelling real-world context related to industrial pollution and identifies a specific research gap. A key strength of Essay A is its detailed \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which justifies significant methodological changes, such as adjusting the concentration of Methyl Orange and the frequency of measurements, showcasing a genuine and iterative scientific process. In contrast, Essay B presents a more standard investigation on vitamin C content. While its research question is clear and the methodology is appropriate, the background information is less detailed and lacks the scientific depth seen in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology does not mention any preliminary work, suggesting a less refined experimental design process. Essay A's justification for its controlled variables is also more rigorous, as seen in its detailed table format, compared to Essay B's simpler list. While both essays meet the basic requirements for safety and variable identification, Essay A's overall approach reflects a much higher level of scientific inquiry and personal engagement with the topic.",
