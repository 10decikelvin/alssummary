  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong research questions and relevant background information. Essay A's investigation into the effect of pH on Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is well-contextualized with personal engagement and clear explanations of BOD and the Winkler method. Essay B's exploration of temperature's effect on a reaction's rate constant to determine activation energy is built upon a robust theoretical foundation, thoroughly explaining collision theory and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific rigor in its methodology and planning. The procedure in Essay B is meticulously detailed, including precise calculations for preparing solutions from solid reagents (e.g., \"31.52 g of oxalic acid\"), accounting for purity (\"98% purity\" for KMnO\u2084), and identifying the limiting reactant. In contrast, Essay A's methodology lacks precision, relying on ambiguous measurements like \"6 drops of HCl\" and \"6 drops of NaOH\" without specifying concentrations, which is a critical flaw when pH is the independent variable.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's approach to controlled variables and safety is more thorough. It uses a water bath to control temperature, a more active and effective method than Essay A's proposal to store samples in a \"dark cupboard\". Essay B's safety and environmental assessment is also more specific, correctly identifying that the potassium hydroxide product requires special disposal, stating it was \"disposed of as a hazardous waste... following the laboratory regulations.\" Essay A's environmental consideration is weaker, with a general statement about disposal \"in basin of school laboratory.\" While both are good, Essay B's superior precision, detailed planning, and deeper consideration of experimental controls and impact make it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
