  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed investigations. Essay B has a very clear methodology and a strong personal connection to the topic. The research question is focused, and the procedure is logical and easy to follow. The identification and control of variables are also well-documented in a clear table format.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a greater depth of understanding and a more sophisticated level of inquiry. The research question connects several key concepts from the IB Chemistry syllabus: transition metal chemistry, complex ion formation, and spectroscopy. The background information is thorough, correctly explaining d-orbital splitting and ligand field theory, which is more advanced than the principles of electrolysis covered in Essay B.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology, while challenging, is well-considered. The student anticipates potential issues, such as the precipitation of metal hydroxides and the need for excess ammonia, which shows a strong grasp of the underlying chemical principles. The evaluation section in Essay A also reflects a deeper level of critical thinking, particularly in identifying the potential for the Jahn-Teller effect in the copper complex and how that might affect the results. This demonstrates a superior level of independent thought and engagement with the topic.\n\nWhile Essay B is a very solid and competent investigation, Essay A tackles a more complex topic with a higher degree of scientific insight and inquiry, making it the stronger of the two for Criterion B.",
