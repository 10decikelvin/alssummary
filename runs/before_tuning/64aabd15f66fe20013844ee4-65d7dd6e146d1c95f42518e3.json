  "decision": "sample response 2 is better",
  "reasoning": "Both texts accurately describe an experiment investigating how temperature affects the rate law of a chemical reaction, specifically focusing on the reaction between sodium thiosulfate solution and hydrochloric acid. This reaction produces sulfur as a precipitate, conveniently obsc. Both responses effectively fulfill the IB Chemistry HL IA requirement of involving manipulation of relevant data through different variations of the independent variable, specifically demonstrating good practice in terms to controlling temperature. However, the first response focuses solely on this one chemical reaction. In contrast, the second example showcases a more comprehensive approach. While it also investigates the effect of the temperature on reaction kinetics, it does so for two different reactions: the classic hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosmitherein demonstrating an understanding of the relationship between activation energy and reaction rate across different chemical reactions.  The depth of analysis is more significant due to the inclusion of additional data for comparison and analysis, as well as considering multiple concentrations of hydrochloric acid to deduce the rate orders. The additional complexity of this second research question allows for a more comprehensive investigation and demonstration of IB assessment criteria like exploration, data analysis, and evaluation. Therefore, while both are good demonstrations, the second response showcases stronger design and potential for deeper analysis, and likely a stronger overall grade based on International Baccalaureate (IB) criteria.",
