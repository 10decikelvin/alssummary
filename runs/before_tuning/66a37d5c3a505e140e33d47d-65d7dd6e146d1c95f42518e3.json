  "reasoning": "The response on the right provides more specific and insightful analysis of the design. While both responses correctly identify variables like the choice of potato solution concentration and temperature as independent variable, the response on the to be slightly better due to its deeper connection between methodology and biological concepts. It explicitly explains the reasoning behind each choice of controlled variables like pH and time of experiment for instance linking to enzyme activity. Additionally, while both experiments are of comparable quality, the one on the right delves into more detail about how the different potato types might have different levels of peroxidase due to evolutionary adaptation to their environment. This indicates a stronger demonstration of scientific knowledge. While both are suitable for their specified level, the justification in the right answer shows more in--depth understanding of factors influencing enzyme-catalysed reactions.",
