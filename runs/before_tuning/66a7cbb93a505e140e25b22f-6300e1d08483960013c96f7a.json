  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more complete exploration of its research question, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in its meticulous and scientifically sound methodology. The research question is focused and appropriately complex, and the background information provides relevant chemical context, including balanced equations for each reaction, which directly supports the investigation. The experimental design, a classic acid-base titration, is well-suited to the question, and the procedure is detailed enough to be replicated, specifying apparatus uncertainties (\"Burette 50 cm\u00b3 \u00b10.05 cm\u00b3\") and a plan for multiple trials (\"5 trials for each antacid\"). Essay A also includes a comprehensive section on safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, fulfilling all aspects of the criterion.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B has a strong theoretical background section explaining freezing point depression, its experimental design is fundamentally flawed. The student correctly identifies the Van't Hoff factor (number of ions) as the key principle but then fails to apply it by choosing to control for salt *mass* instead of *moles*. This is a critical error, as equal masses of different salts contain different numbers of moles, confounding the very variable they aim to investigate. The methodology is also vague, referring to \"identical ice cubes\" without specifying how this is ensured, and lacks any mention of repeated trials for reliability. Most significantly, Essay B completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major oversight for this criterion. Therefore, Essay A's robust and complete experimental plan makes it clearly better.",
