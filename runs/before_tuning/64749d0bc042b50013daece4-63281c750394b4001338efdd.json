  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of detail, foresight, and scientific rigor in its exploration and planning. The research question in Essay A is ambitious, investigating two independent variables (salinity and temperature), but it is supported by an exceptionally thorough and well-structured plan. Its background section not only provides relevant chemical theory but also critically evaluates and justifies the choice of Winkler's titration over other methods, showcasing significant research. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of variables is exemplary; for each controlled variable, it explains precisely *why* it must be controlled and *how* this will be achieved (e.g., for \"Atmospheric pressure,\" it states \"All procedures were conducted in the same lab...to ensure constant pressure\"). The safety section is also superior, providing a chemical-specific breakdown of hazards and disposal methods.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B has a suitable research question and demonstrates good personal engagement, it lacks the depth of Essay A. The section on controlled variables is minimal, simply listing the variable and the control method without justifying its importance. For instance, it just says for \"Room Temperature\" that it will be controlled by \"Ensuring that all trials are made in the same room,\" which is far less explanatory than Essay A's approach. The methodology has potential unaddressed flaws, such as assuming constant power from the immersion heater, and the safety precautions are generic. Critically, the inclusion of a \"Limitations\" section describing failing equipment (\"calorimeters used were too old...sometimes melted,\" \"current...was fluctuating\") reveals a lack of planning and foresight that is a key component of the Exploration criterion. Overall, Essay A's meticulous and scientifically justified plan makes it a much stronger submission for Criterion B.",
