  "reasoning": "This was a close comparison, as both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B. Essay B presents a more focused and well-phrased research question: \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\" This is superior to Essay A's RQ, which is phrased more as a statement of intent. Essay B also excels in its background section, providing a clear and concise derivation of the second-order integrated rate law, demonstrating a strong grasp of the underlying chemical kinetics.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior in the other, more practical aspects of exploration and design. Its methodology is not only detailed but also includes a \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains the reasoning behind choices like the temperature range and reagent concentrations, showing excellent personal engagement. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of controlled variables is exemplary, presenting them in a table that details both *how* and *why* each variable is controlled. This is far more thorough than Essay B's list of variables, which focuses more on technique. Finally, Essay A's risk assessment is significantly more comprehensive, using a table to detail multiple specific risks (glassware, flammability, chemical hazards) and corresponding precautions, whereas Essay B's section is comparatively brief.\n\nOverall, while Essay B has a stronger theoretical foundation and RQ, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and considered approach to the actual design and planning of the experiment, which is the core of Criterion B. Its detailed justification, superior handling of variables, and comprehensive safety assessment make it the better example of exploration.",
