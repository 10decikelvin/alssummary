  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more consistently well-developed and fundamentally sound exploration than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature... of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration,\" is clear, focused, and sets up a robust investigation. The background information is particularly strong, providing detailed context on Vitamin C's chemistry, its biological role, and, crucially, a clear explanation of the redox titration methodology, including the relevant chemical equation. The methodology is logical and replicable, with clearly defined variables and a thorough safety, ethical, and environmental section that thoughtfully considers food waste.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating some high-level thinking such as justifying the choice of concentrations and explicitly stating experimental assumptions, is undermined by a significant conceptual error. It incorrectly identifies the dependent variable as \"The total mass of the fuel burnt (grams)\" when it should be the calculated enthalpy of combustion. While the mass change is a necessary measurement, it is not the dependent variable itself. This indicates a misunderstanding of fundamental experimental design principles. Furthermore, its safety and environmental considerations are adequate but less comprehensive than Essay A's, and it dismisses ethical considerations with the statement, \"No ethical considerations were considered,\" which is a missed opportunity for deeper reflection.\n\nIn summary, Essay A is superior because its experimental design is methodologically sound from the ground up, with a thorough background and thoughtful consideration of all aspects of the exploration. Essay B shows potential but is compromised by a critical flaw in its definition of the dependent variable, making Essay A the better example of Criterion B.",
