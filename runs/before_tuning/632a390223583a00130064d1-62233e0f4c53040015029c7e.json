  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is focused, precise, and sets clear parameters for the investigation. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is convoluted and less direct about its primary goal of measuring buffer capacity.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant differentiator. Essay A provides an exceptionally detailed, step-by-step procedure with specific quantities, uncertainties, and clear diagrams, making the experiment easily replicable. Its section on variables is exemplary, not only defining independent, dependent, and controlled variables with precision but also thoughtfully including uncontrolled variables and their potential impact. Essay B's methodology is confusingly organized with non-sequential numbering, making it difficult to follow, and the control of variables is described with significantly less rigor.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background information provides a more comprehensive scientific context, clearly defining complex concepts like Young's Modulus with relevant formulas. While Essay B's background is adequate, it is less coherent. Finally, Essay A presents a thorough risk assessment that includes safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, far surpassing Essay B's brief and incomplete safety section. Essay A's overall presentation, detail, and scientific rigor are of a much higher quality.",
