  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a solid foundation for a scientific investigation, but Essay A demonstrates a more complete and well-considered approach to the \"Exploration\" criterion.\n\nEssay A presents a sharply focused research question with clearly defined independent and dependent variables, along with their specific ranges and units. The personal engagement is strong and directly linked to the research question, providing a compelling rationale. The background information is thorough, correctly identifying and explaining the underlying electrochemical principles, including Faraday's laws of electrolysis, which provides a strong theoretical framework for the hypothesis. The methodology is particularly impressive; it is detailed, repeatable, and shows a keen awareness of the need to control variables. The inclusion of a clear procedure for preparing the standard solution and a comprehensive list of controlled variables highlights a meticulous approach to experimental design. Furthermore, the explicit consideration of safety and environmental issues is commendable.\n\nEssay B's topic is also well-contextualized with relevant background information on alcohols, intermolecular forces, and enthalpy of combustion. The research questions are clear. However, as a database-driven investigation, it lacks the complexity of experimental design that Essay A showcases. While sourcing data is a valid scientific skill, Essay A's plan to collect primary data requires more detailed procedural planning, consideration of practical limitations, and management of variables, which are key aspects of this criterion. Essay A's inclusion of a calculated prediction based on Faraday's laws (Figure 6) further elevates its quality, demonstrating a deeper engagement with the theoretical underpinnings before the experiment even begins.\n\nTherefore, Essay A is stronger because it presents a more robust and comprehensive experimental design, a clearer link between theory and practical application, and a more thorough consideration of procedural details and variables.",
