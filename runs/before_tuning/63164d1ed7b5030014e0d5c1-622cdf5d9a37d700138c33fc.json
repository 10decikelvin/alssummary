  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, which investigates the effect of oil saturation on the Maillard reaction, is more original, complex, and scientifically sophisticated than Essay A's more standard investigation into vitamin C degradation. Essay B's background section is exceptionally strong, drawing on scientific literature (\"Toyosaki et al.\") to explain advanced concepts like Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) and adeptly justifying the colorimetric method using the Lambert-Beer law and color theory. In contrast, while Essay A's background on redox titration is correct and clear, it covers a more foundational topic.\n\nThe methodology is where Essay B truly excels and surpasses Essay A. The procedure is meticulously detailed across three distinct phases (dough making, buffer preparation, AGE extraction), making it highly replicable and showing impressive experimental design. The table of controlled variables in Essay B is exemplary, listing numerous factors with clear methods of control and justifications for why they matter. Essay A's methodology is sound and replicable, but it is far simpler, and the control of variables is less comprehensive. For example, Essay B considers factors like \"Dough Fermentation Time & Environment,\" showcasing a deeper level of critical thinking about the experimental system. Finally, the personal engagement in Essay B feels more authentic and is better integrated as the driving force behind the complex investigation, whereas Essay A's is more generic. While Essay A is a competent and solid piece of work, Essay B displays a superior level of scientific inquiry, planning, and depth.",
