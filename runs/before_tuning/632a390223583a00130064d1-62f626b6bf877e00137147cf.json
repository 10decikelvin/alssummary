  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much more thorough and considered approach to experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A is focused, specific, and clearly testable: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". In contrast, Essay B's question is awkwardly phrased and lacks clarity on how the independent variable (expiration date) will be operationalized. Essay A provides extensive and relevant background information, defining key concepts like Young's Modulus with appropriate equations, which directly justifies the methodology. Essay B's background is extremely brief, offering only a generic definition of titration without explaining the specific chemistry of complexometric titration with EDTA.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is exceptionally detailed and repeatable, including specific quantities, timings, and the use of technology like LabQuest 2 and Tracker to improve accuracy. Essay B's method is simplistic and critically flawed; it fails to describe how the different milk samples (pre- and post-expiration) will be obtained or stored, and it omits the crucial step of sample preparation, making the titration of an opaque milk solution unfeasible. Essay A excels in its identification and justification of variables, providing comprehensive tables for controlled and uncontrolled variables that explain not just *what* will be controlled, but *how* and *why*. Essay B completely omits any discussion of variables. Finally, while both essays include a risk assessment, Essay A's is more comprehensive, thoughtfully including safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, whereas Essay B's is more basic and incorrectly includes error analysis within the risk assessment section.",
