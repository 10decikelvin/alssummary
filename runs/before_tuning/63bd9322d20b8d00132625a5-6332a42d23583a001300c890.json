  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a solid foundation for an IA, however, Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design and data analysis. The research question in B is more specific and testable, aiming to determine the activation energy, which is a calculated value derived from experimental data. Essay A, on the other hand, asks a more general question about the effect of stearin concentration on enthalpy, which is a good starting point but lacks the same level of scientific rigor in its framing. Furthermore, Essay B shows a superior understanding of experimental controls and error analysis, as seen in the detailed discussion of temperature regulation and the inclusion of a standard deviation calculation. While Essay A does acknowledge potential sources of error like heat loss, it does not demonstrate the same level of care in quantifying or mitigating these issues. The inclusion of the Arrhenius equation and a clear plan to calculate activation energy in Essay B indicates a deeper engagement with chemical kinetics theory compared to the more descriptive approach in Essay A. Finally, the proposed extension in Essay B is more insightful, suggesting further investigation into other factors affecting reaction rates, whereas the extension in Essay A is somewhat superficial. Therefore, due to its more sophisticated experimental design, clear theoretical framework, and rigorous approach to data analysis, Essay B is the stronger of the two.",
