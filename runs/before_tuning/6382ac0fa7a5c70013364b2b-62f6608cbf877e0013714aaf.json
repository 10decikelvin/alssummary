  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, clear, and investigates a relationship between two continuous variables, which is characteristic of a strong scientific investigation. The background section is exemplary; it not only introduces the reaction but also delves deep into the relevant chemical principles, deriving the integrated rate law (Equation 1.5) and explaining the Arrhenius equation (Equation 1.3), which provides a robust theoretical foundation that directly justifies the experimental methodology. The identification and explanation of variables in Essay B are precise and correct, with clear justification for the chosen range of the independent variable and a good understanding of how controlled variables impact the experiment.\n\nEssay A, while exploring an interesting topic, is weaker in its fundamental design. The research question is more descriptive than investigatory, aiming to find a quantity rather than explore a relationship. The background information is superficial, providing reaction equations but lacking a deep explanation of the principles behind back titration or thermal decomposition. A major flaw in Essay A is the incorrect identification of the independent variable as the \"Mass of sample,\" when it should be the \"Source of the sample\" (chalk, seashell, rangoli). This indicates a misunderstanding of experimental design. Furthermore, the procedure in Essay A contains a significant methodological error by specifying the use of a measuring cylinder to measure a 25 cm\u00b3 aliquot for titration, a step that requires the precision of a pipette. While both essays adequately cover safety considerations, the superior theoretical depth, stronger research question, and correct application of experimental design principles make Essay B the clear winner for Criterion B.",
