  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and meticulous planning. Essay A establishes a compelling personal and global context for its database investigation into alcohol fuels, with a clear research question and well-defined variables. However, its methodology, while appropriate for a database study, is inherently less complex than designing a hands-on experiment.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, excels in its detailed and sophisticated experimental design. Its research question is exceptionally well-formulated, specifying the independent variables with ranges, the dependent variable with units, and the exact analytical technique: \"How does varying salinity... and temperature... affect the amount of dissolved oxygen(mg/L)... measured through Winkler's titration?\" The methodology is thorough enough to be replicated, and critically, it justifies the choice of Winkler's titration by comparing it to alternative methods, showcasing advanced research and critical thinking. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of controlled variables is exemplary; it uses a table to clearly identify each variable, explain *why* it must be controlled, and detail *how* it was controlled. This level of detail in controlling variables like \"Exposure to atmospheric oxygen/air\" and \"Atmospheric pressure\" is significantly more comprehensive than in Essay A. Finally, the safety and disposal considerations in Essay B are specific, chemical-by-chemical, and highly professional, surpassing the more general environmental context provided in Essay A.",
