  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and scientifically sound investigations. Essay A, however, demonstrates a slightly more thorough and rigorous approach to the experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B.\n\n**Essay A's Strengths:**\n*   **Detailed Rationale:** The introduction clearly establishes the personal motivation and links it to a scientific question. The background information is comprehensive, explaining the principles of electrolysis and citing external sources.\n*   **Variable Control:** The controlled variables are not just listed; the essay explains *why* each variable needs to be controlled and *how* it will be achieved. For example, it explains that the distance between electrodes affects the current and details a method using a wooden splint to keep this consistent. This shows a deeper understanding of the experimental design.\n*   **Procedure Precision:** The step-by-step procedure is meticulous, including details like cleaning the electrodes, using a volumetric flask for the solution, and using fresh electrodes for each trial to avoid confounding variables like anode depletion.\n*   **Safety & Environment:** The safety section is specific about the risks (e.g., corrosiveness of H\u2082SO\u2084) and corresponding precautions. The environmental considerations are thoughtful, suggesting specific disposal methods.\n\n**Essay B's Strengths:**\n*   **Strong Personal Engagement:** The story about the family car project provides excellent context and a clear motivation for the investigation.\n*   **Quantitative Background:** It directly includes and explains the formula derived from Faraday's laws, linking the theory directly to the expected quantitative outcome.\n*   **Self-Reflection (in Evaluation):** While technically part of a later criterion, the detailed \"Limitations\" section reflects well on the planning process, showing the student has considered potential issues.\n\n**Comparison and Justification for Decision:**\n\nWhile Essay B is very good, Essay A is superior in the rigor and detail of its experimental methodology. The justification for controlling variables is more explicit and scientifically grounded in Essay A. Furthermore, details like using fresh anodes for each trial and a more precise method for ensuring consistent electrode distance suggest a more carefully planned experiment designed to yield reliable data. Essay B's procedure, while solid, has minor weaknesses, such as the less precise method for drying the nails (\"leave it for two days\"), which could introduce variability. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a stronger overall grasp of the experimental design process.",
