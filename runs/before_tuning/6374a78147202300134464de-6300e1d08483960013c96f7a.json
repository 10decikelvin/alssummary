  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger application of the scientific method and a deeper understanding of experimental design, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in the robust and scientifically sound methodology. The background information is comprehensive, not only explaining the basics of enthalpy but also delving into electrochemistry (E\u00b0cell) and thermodynamics (\u0394G\u00b0) to rigorously establish the reaction's feasibility. This theoretical depth provides a strong foundation for the investigation. Furthermore, the experimental design is logical; the variables are correctly identified, and the controlled variables (volume, time, temperature, pressure) are appropriate and well-justified. The procedure itself follows a standard and correct calorimetric technique, including measuring temperature over time to allow for graphical extrapolation, which is a key skill. The inclusion of apparatus uncertainties and a dedicated risk assessment section further bolsters its quality.\n\nEssay B, while having a well-phrased research question and a clear background on freezing point depression, suffers from a critical flaw in its experimental design. The background correctly identifies that the effect is dependent on the number of dissolved ions (related to moles and the van't Hoff factor). However, the methodology then contradicts this by controlling for the *mass* of the salts (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\") rather than the *moles*. Since the salts have different molar masses, using an equal mass means an unequal number of moles is being tested, introducing a confounding variable that invalidates the comparison. This fundamental error demonstrates a disconnect between the theoretical understanding and practical application. Additionally, Essay B completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a significant deficiency for Criterion B. While its background is clear, it cannot compensate for the flawed methodology.",
