  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a superior mastery of Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent is there a relationship between the temperature... of various citrus juices... and their vitamin C... concentration,\" is exceptionally well-focused, clearly defining the independent variable (temperature with specific levels), dependent variable (concentration), samples, and analytical method. The background section provides a strong scientific context, explaining the properties of ascorbic acid and the principles of redox titration, and culminates in a clear, well-justified hypothesis based on the thermal degradation of vitamin C. The methodology is robust and detailed; the table of controlled variables is exemplary, with specific methods for control and clear reasons for their importance. Furthermore, the selection of apparatus, including stated uncertainties, is appropriate for a precise investigation.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B presents an ambitious and interesting investigation comparing two methodologies, its experimental design contains significant flaws. The attempt to control temperature for thermal decomposition by using \"the same Bunsen Burner\" is scientifically unsound, as a Bunsen burner's temperature is neither constant nor easily controllable, a weakness the student later acknowledges. Additionally, the procedure for the back titration specifies using a measuring cylinder to take a 25 cm\u00b3 aliquot, which is a major procedural error that introduces significant uncertainty where a volumetric pipette should have been used. While Essay B's background and safety considerations are adequate, the fundamental flaws in its experimental design and control of variables make it weaker than Essay A. Essay A's methodology is sound, replicable, and designed to yield reliable data, showcasing a much stronger grasp of experimental exploration.",
