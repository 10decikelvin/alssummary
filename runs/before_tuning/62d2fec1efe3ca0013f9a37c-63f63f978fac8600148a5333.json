  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough exploration of its research question compared to Essay A. While both essays present clear and focused research questions, Essay B's is more sophisticated, incorporating the specific analytical technique. The background information in Essay B is substantially more comprehensive, providing detailed chemical principles of biosorption, including chelation and ion exchange, and explaining the specific role of functional groups in orange peels. In contrast, Essay A's background is more superficial, covering standard textbook concepts like the Arrhenius equation without the same depth of application.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant differentiator. Essay B's methodology is meticulous, outlining preliminary trials that informed the final experimental design, which is a hallmark of excellent scientific practice. The student in B identifies and justifies a wider and more relevant range of controlled variables, such as the brand of oranges and shaking speed, demonstrating a deeper understanding of potential sources of error. Furthermore, Essay B's procedure includes sophisticated steps like creating a calibration curve, centrifuging samples, and using a specifically prepared blank, all of which enhance the validity and reliability of the data collection process. Essay A's method is workable but less detailed and fails to address potential issues as proactively. For example, Essay A notes the large percentage uncertainty from using a burette for small volumes but does not modify the procedure to mitigate this, whereas Essay B's methodology shows clear problem-solving.\n\nFinally, while both essays adequately address safety and environmental concerns, the overall quality of the investigation's design and contextualization in Essay B is far superior, reflecting a more profound engagement with the scientific process.",
