  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a substantially stronger exploration of its research question. Its methodology is exceptionally well-developed, highlighted by the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which details a thoughtful, iterative process of selecting the appropriate measurement device, from a stopwatch to a colorimeter and finally to a lux sensor. This shows a deep engagement with the practical challenges of the investigation. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables is exemplary, providing not just the variable but a clear scientific reason for its control and a specific, practical method for how it will be controlled. In contrast, while Essay B has a solid research question and relevant background theory, its methodology is fundamentally flawed for several of its chosen metal ions\u2014a weakness the author acknowledges in the evaluation when discussing the unexpected oxidation of Fe\u00b2\u207a/Mn\u00b2\u207a and the non-octahedral geometry of the copper complex. This indicates a significant oversight in the initial planning and exploration phase. Essay A also presents a more thorough and specific safety and environmental consideration section, justifying the decision to scale down the reaction to reduce waste, whereas Essay B's considerations are more generic. While both essays have focused research questions, Essay A\u2019s meticulous planning, justification of methodological choices, and robust control of variables make it a clearly superior example of IB Criterion B.",
