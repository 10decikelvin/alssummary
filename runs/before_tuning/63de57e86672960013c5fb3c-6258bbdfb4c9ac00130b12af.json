  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a superior mastery of the elements required for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exceptionally clear, focused, and includes all necessary parameters. The background information is concise, directly relevant, and effectively links the theory of electrolysis and Faraday's Law to the hypothesis. Furthermore, the methodology is logical, detailed enough for replication, and the justification for the chosen range of the independent variable (\"their advice will be explored but also challenged\") shows excellent personal engagement and critical thinking.\n\nEssay B, while ambitious in its scope by investigating both Acid Value and Saponification Value, is weaker in its overall execution and clarity. The research question is phrased more as a statement of intent rather than a formal, focused question. The methodology, though complex, contains confusing terminology, such as the repeated reference to a \"soxhlet apparatus\" for simple heating, which is likely an incorrect application of the equipment. While its tables for controlled variables and risk assessment are well-structured and thorough, the core experimental plan is less convincing and harder to follow than Essay A's. Essay A's straightforward and well-justified plan represents a more proficient and thoughtfully designed investigation.\n\nUltimately, Essay A is better because it presents a complete, coherent, and highly focused exploration from start to finish. The clarity of the research question, the depth of the background research, and the well-articulated, replicable methodology make it a stronger example of Criterion B.",
