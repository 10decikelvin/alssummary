  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a decent overview of the experiment. However, Student B's submission is slightly better due to its comprehensive and well-structured approach. Student B not only details the procedure but also includes an evaluation of the method, acknowledging potential sources of error and suggesting improvements. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the scientific process. Furthermore, Student B presents a clearer rationale for choosing specific experimental parameters, such as the temperature range, linking them directly to the research question. While Student A also provides the essential components of the experiment, it lacks the depth of analysis and critical reflection present in Student B's work. For example, Student B explicitly states the assumption of negligible error in the concentration of HCl, demonstrating awareness of potential limitations in their methodology, which is a key aspect of a strong scientific report.
