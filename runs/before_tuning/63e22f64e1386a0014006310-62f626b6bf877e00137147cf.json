  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A is its clear, logical structure and comprehensive detail. Its research question is twofold, focused, and sets a clear scope for the investigation: \"What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion... [and] What is the impact of the classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) of an alcohol...\". This is supported by a thorough background section that defines key terms and explains the relevant chemical principles. Furthermore, Essay A excels in its methodology, providing a replicable procedure and an outstanding variables table that not only identifies controlled variables but also justifies why they need to be controlled and how this will be achieved.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is incomplete and poorly structured. Its research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is awkwardly phrased and lacks clarity on how the independent variable ('expiration date') will be operationalized. Critically, Essay B is missing entire sections essential for Criterion B, including an introduction, background information explaining the chemistry of titration, and a dedicated variables section. While it includes a risk assessment, the procedure is presented as an incomplete list starting at step 6, making it impossible to replicate. Essay A presents a fully realized and methodologically sound plan, whereas Essay B appears to be a fragmented and underdeveloped draft. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a far superior level of planning, scientific understanding, and attention to experimental design.",
