  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of planning and scientific consideration, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its research question is well-focused, and the background information provides a strong theoretical foundation, directly linking the concept of \"active sites\" in heterogeneous catalysis to the independent variable (mass of catalyst). Essay A's key strength lies in its meticulous identification and justification of variables; for instance, the effort to control the surface area of the MnO\u2082 by standardizing the grinding process (\"200 turns at medium pressure\") shows exceptional attention to detail and an understanding of complex experimental factors. Furthermore, its safety and environmental sections are specific and well-researched, referencing an external source (CLEAPPS) and linking practices to the \"12 Principles of Green Chemistry.\"\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B presents a clear research question and a standard, appropriate methodology, it contains a significant methodological flaw. The student explicitly decides not to control for the mass of the antacid tablets, stating, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This decision, while justified from a consumer perspective, fundamentally undermines the scientific goal of comparing the chemical effectiveness of the active ingredients, as any difference in results could be due to differing tablet masses rather than the ingredients themselves. Additionally, the justifications for controlled variables and the safety/environmental considerations in Essay B are far more generic than in Essay A. Essay A's thoughtful design, deep understanding of variables, and specific safety protocols clearly mark it as the better-planned investigation.",
