  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and well-developed exploration compared to Essay A. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its comprehensive and detailed methodology. It includes preliminary trials to justify methodological choices (e.g., \"30 minutes was used as the default duration of adsorption\"), a complete apparatus list with uncertainties, and a clear, repeatable, multi-step procedure. Furthermore, Essay B's research question, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution... affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels,\" is more sophisticated and focused than Essay A's, specifying the pH range and quantification method. The background information in Essay B is extensive and directly relevant, explaining biosorption mechanisms and justifying the choice of an acidic pH range to avoid precipitation.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is critically incomplete. While it provides a solid introduction and background on ascorbic acid and the principles of redox titration, it completely lacks a procedural methodology. The variables table is unfinished, with the \"Method of Measurement\" column left blank and no mention of controlled variables, which is a major omission for Criterion B. Essay A also fails to include any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, another key requirement of this criterion. Although Essay A's hypothesis is well-justified with kinetic theory, this strength cannot compensate for the fundamental absence of a viable experimental plan. Therefore, Essay B is unequivocally better as it presents a complete, well-researched, and methodologically sound plan for investigation, fulfilling all aspects of Criterion B to a high standard.",
