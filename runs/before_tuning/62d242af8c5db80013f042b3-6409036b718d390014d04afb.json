  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its greater depth of scientific inquiry and methodological sophistication.\n\nEssay A presents a well-structured and focused investigation. The research question is clear, and the background information provides a solid, if somewhat standard, explanation of complexometric titration. The identification and justification of variables are excellent, presented in clear tables, and the safety and environmental considerations are thorough. The inclusion of a detailed limitations and improvements table is also a significant strength. However, the connection between the background theory (calcium phosphate solubility) and the experimental design feels a little superficial, and the procedure, while adequate, could be clearer in its trial structure.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, excels in demonstrating a deeper and more authentic exploratory process. The introduction immediately frames the BZ reaction within a fascinating real-world context (cardiac arrhythmia), showcasing significant personal engagement. The background information is exceptionally detailed, linking kinetics, collision theory (with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution graph), redox reactions, and autocatalytic mechanisms directly to the phenomenon being investigated. A key strength of Essay B is the dedicated \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which explicitly details the student's thought process in selecting an appropriate measurement technique (lux sensor over visual timing or a colorimeter), justifying the choice of catalyst, and explaining how practical constraints shaped the experimental design. This demonstrates a level of independent thinking and problem-solving that goes beyond simply following a known procedure. The use of a data logger for objective measurement also represents a more sophisticated approach to data collection than the titration in Essay A, which is more prone to subjective endpoint determination, a weakness Essay A itself identifies.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A is a very competent and well-executed piece of work, Essay B showcases a higher level of scientific curiosity, theoretical understanding, and methodological refinement, making it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
