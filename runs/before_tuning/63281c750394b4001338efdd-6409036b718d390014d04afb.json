  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger in its demonstration of Criterion B: Exploration. Its research question is highly focused, complex, and clearly operationalized: \"How does varying temperature...affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator, measured by number of oscillation cycles occurred and oscillations per minute?\". This contrasts with Essay A's solid but more standard question. Essay B's background information is exceptional, providing a compelling real-world context (cardiac arrhythmia), detailed chemical theory (REDOX, collision theory, reaction mechanisms), and a clear link between the theory and the investigation. While Essay A's background is relevant, it is far less detailed and sophisticated.\n\nThe most significant discriminator is the methodology. Essay B includes an outstanding \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which details the author's process of preliminary experimentation and refinement, justifying the choice of a lux sensor over other methods. This demonstrates a high level of personal engagement and scientific thinking that Essay A lacks. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is exemplary, presented in a comprehensive table with clear justifications for control. In contrast, Essay A's identification of the dependent variable is slightly imprecise (\"temperature difference\" instead of the calculated \"specific heat capacity\"). Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are far superior; it identifies specific hazards for each chemical and details thoughtful mitigation strategies, including reducing reagent volumes to minimize waste, whereas Essay A's considerations are generic and incomplete.",
