  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question is highly specific, outlining the exact temperatures and concentrations to be used, which indicates a well-planned investigation from the outset. The background information is comprehensive and at a high academic level, effectively linking the core concept of equilibrium (Kc) to advanced topics like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation, providing a robust theoretical framework. In contrast, Essay B's background, while adequate, is more simplistic in its explanation of why specific heat capacity changes and relies on an analogy to NaCl rather than a deeper theoretical exploration.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology and control of variables. Essay A includes a section on \"Preliminary experiments,\" which is a hallmark of excellent exploration, showing how the method was refined to address issues like unwanted absorbance and reaction time. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, detailing not only *what* will be controlled but also a clear rationale for *why* and a precise description of *how*. Essay B's list of controlled variables is sparse and the methods for controlling them are vague (e.g., \"Ensuring that all trials are made in the same room\"). Furthermore, Essay A's procedure is meticulous, specifying equipment with uncertainties, whereas Essay B's procedure is less precise.\n\nFinally, Essay A presents a much stronger consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors. It identifies specific hazards for each chemical (\"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\") and outlines concrete disposal procedures (\"iron (III) nitrate and nitric acid normally need to be neutralised\"). Essay B's safety precautions are generic (\"Wear safety goggles\"), and its environmental consideration is limited to a vague statement about a \"disposal box,\" showing minimal engagement.",
