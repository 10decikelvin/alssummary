  "reasoning": "Both essays present commendable Criterion B sections, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of proficiency in experimental design and exploration. Essay A is a well-structured database investigation with clear research questions and a solid background connecting thermochemistry to the relevant context of biofuels. Its methodology is appropriate for a database study, correctly identifying reliable sources like NIST and explaining data processing steps. However, its research question is split into two parts, which is slightly less focused than Essay B's singular, precise question.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, is an exemplar of a well-planned experimental investigation. The personal engagement is authentic and leads directly to a highly focused research question: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\". The methodology is exceptionally thorough, with an outstanding section on controlled variables that not only lists them but also explains precisely why they matter and how they will be controlled. Furthermore, Essay B includes a detailed, step-by-step procedure and a comprehensive \"Risk Assessment\" section covering safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific details on chemical handling (H\u2082SO\u2084) and disposal. This attention to the practical and safety aspects of the investigation is a significant strength that is largely absent from Essay A. While Essay A is a competent database study, Essay B's meticulous planning, detailed methodology, and robust safety considerations showcase a more sophisticated and complete exploration.",
