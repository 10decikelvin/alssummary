  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A in all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay B is excellent: \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at (20.0 \u00b0C, 40.0 \u00b0C, 60.0 \u00b0C, 80.0 \u00b0C, 100.0 \u00b0C) affect its calcium content (in mg) by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\". It is highly specific, focused, and clearly outlines the independent variable (temperature with defined levels), the dependent variable (calcium content), the specific substance under investigation, and the analytical technique. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously, which is an overly ambitious and unfocused approach for this level of investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B provides a comprehensive and chemically sound background, thoroughly explaining the principles of complexometric titration with EDTA, including relevant chemical equations. Essay A's background is superficial, offering only a basic definition of solubility without delving into the specific thermodynamic principles (like lattice and hydration enthalpies) that govern the solubility differences between the chosen salts. The methodology in Essay B is meticulous, providing a replicable, step-by-step procedure with precise quantities and concentrations, and even justifies the choice of method over alternatives. Essay A's method is vague, lacking critical details such as the mass of salts or volume of water used, making it difficult to reproduce.\n\nThe identification of variables in Essay B is exemplary, presented in clear tables with justifications for why each controlled variable is important. Essay A's variable section is confused, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable rather than the type of anion. Finally, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are specific, detailed, and directly relevant to the hazardous materials being used (e.g., ammonia buffer), while Essay A's precautions are generic and brief.",
