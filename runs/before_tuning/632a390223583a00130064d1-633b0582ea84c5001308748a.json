  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly more thorough and well-developed exploration, which is the core of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is focused and directly testable through a hands-on experiment. The methodology is exceptionally detailed and robust, providing a step-by-step procedure that is easily replicable. Strengths include the thoughtful use of technology like Vernier LabQuest and Tracker software to enhance accuracy, and an exemplary table of controlled variables that not only lists the variables but explains precisely how they will be controlled and why it is important. Furthermore, Essay A includes a comprehensive risk assessment that thoughtfully considers safety, environmental, and ethical dimensions.\n\nEssay B, while based on a valid scientific premise, is less impressive in its execution of Criterion B. It is a database investigation, which is a valid approach, but its methodology section lacks the depth and personal engagement seen in Essay A. The student simply lists the databases they will use and mentions basic data processing, such as unit conversion. A critical omission is the complete absence of a safety, ethical, or environmental consideration section. Although a database study has minimal safety risks, it should still address ethical considerations like data sourcing and acknowledge the environmental context that motivated the study in the first place. While Essay B's background information is solid, Essay A's overall planning, attention to detail, and comprehensive consideration of all experimental aspects make it a clearly superior example of Criterion B.",
