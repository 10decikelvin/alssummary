  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of experimental design and error analysis, but Essay B presents a more robust and insightful evaluation.\n\nEssay A effectively identifies the key variables and their manipulation, as shown in the table: \"Independent variable: Concentration... Dependent variable: Change in temperature... Controlled variable: Room temperature... Pressure... Volume... Time.\" The student also provides a detailed procedure and acknowledges potential sources of error, such as the purity of reactants and reaction time. However, the connection between the \"Strengths\" section and how these strengths mitigate specific errors is somewhat weak. For instance, stating that using an electronic balance \"minimise[s] the errors and get[s] more accurate measurements\" is a bit generic.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, excels in its detailed \"Limitations\" section. It not only identifies specific sources of error like \"Heat loss to the surroundings\" and \"Incomplete combustion\" but also correctly classifies them as systematic or random. Furthermore, it provides specific and practical improvements for each limitation, such as using a \"draught shield\" or a \"copper calorimeter\" to reduce heat loss, which demonstrates a deeper understanding of experimental design and control. The suggestion to \"use a temperature probe to reduce the percentage uncertainty\" is a clear and actionable improvement over using a standard thermometer. The analysis of how these errors impact the results (\"The experimental values... would be lower than the actual values\") shows a more sophisticated level of critical reflection.\n\nWhile both students presented a good methodology, Essay B's evaluation of sources of error is significantly more thorough and insightful. The proposed improvements are more specific and demonstrate a superior grasp of experimental refinement. Therefore, Essay B represents a higher level of achievement for this criterion.",
