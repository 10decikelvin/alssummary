  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. The research question is highly focused, and the background information is extensive, relevant, and scientifically rigorous. Essay B effectively uses cited literature to justify its approach and explains complex concepts like the Beer-Lambert law, chromophores, and the necessary titration chemistry to determine the initial bleach concentration. The inclusion of a detailed \"Pre-Test\" section is a major strength, showing foresight and a sophisticated understanding of experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B's identification and justification of variables are excellent, and its safety and environmental considerations are specific, thorough, and well-presented.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is weaker across most aspects of this criterion. While its research question is clear, the background information is more superficial. A significant weakness in Essay A is the incorrect identification of the dependent variable as \"temperature difference\" when it should be the calculated \"specific heat capacity.\" The methodology lacks some critical details, and the safety precautions are generic and underdeveloped, especially concerning waste disposal. Essay B's methodology is not only more detailed but also demonstrates a more complex and well-thought-out experimental plan, making it the clear winner for Criterion B.",
