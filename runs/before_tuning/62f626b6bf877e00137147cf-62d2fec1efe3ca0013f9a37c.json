  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially stronger than Essay A for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused, clear, and demonstrates a high level of student engagement by linking multiple chemical concepts (kinetics, catalysis, and acid strength). Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased and lacks the same level of specificity. Furthermore, Essay B provides a comprehensive background section that explains the relevant chemical theory, including the reaction mechanism, rate law, and the Arrhenius equation, which directly justifies the methodology. Essay A's introduction is minimal and lacks sufficient scientific context for the chosen technique.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is detailed, logical, and includes specific quantities, concentrations, and instructions for preparing solutions, making the experiment highly replicable. Its handling of variables is exemplary, presenting them in a clear table with explicit methods for their control. In contrast, Essay A's method is a vague list of steps, omitting crucial details like sample preparation and the exact quantities of all reagents. Essay A also completely fails to formally identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, which is a significant omission. While both essays include safety considerations, Essay B's is more specific and thorough, addressing chemical-specific hazards and proper disposal methods. Overall, Essay B presents a much more considered, well-planned, and scientifically sound investigation.",
