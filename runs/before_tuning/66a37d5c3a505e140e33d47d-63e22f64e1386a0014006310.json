  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and rigorous approach to the exploration phase of the investigation. Its research question is clear and focused, and the methodology is meticulously detailed, including specific concentrations and uncertainties for key apparatus (e.g., \"100 mL burette (\u00b1 0.1 mL)\", \"Thermometer (\u00b1 0.5\u00b0C)\"). The inclusion of detailed procedures for preparing the standard iodine and starch solutions shows a high level of scientific diligence. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of variables is exemplary, with a well-structured table that not only identifies controlled variables but also provides clear methods and scientific justifications for their control. Crucially, it comprehensively addresses safety, ethical (food waste), and environmental (energy consumption) considerations, which is a key requirement of Criterion B.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a more ambitious and conceptually complex research question by investigating both carbon chain length and isomerism, its planning is less detailed in several areas. The methodology lacks the precision of Essay A; for instance, it does not include uncertainties for any of the measuring equipment, which is a significant oversight in experimental design. The background information is solid, but the section on variables, while good, is slightly less robust than Essay A's. The most significant weakness of Essay B in this criterion is its complete omission of any ethical or environmental considerations, focusing solely on safety risks. Therefore, although Essay B's chemical inquiry is arguably more advanced, Essay A presents a much more complete, careful, and well-rounded experimental plan that better fulfills all aspects of Criterion B.",
