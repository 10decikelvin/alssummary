  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, investigating the Maillard reaction with different oils, is more sophisticated and original than the standard antacid titration in Essay B. Essay A's background section is exemplary; it is grounded in academic literature (citing Toyosaki et al.), identifies a specific gap in the research (real food vs. model food), and thoroughly explains the underlying chemical principles of its analytical method (Lambert-Beer Law). In contrast, Essay B's background provides a competent but basic overview of acid-base neutralization.\n\nThe methodology in Essay A is exceptionally detailed, outlining precise steps for dough preparation, buffer solution synthesis, and AGE extraction, making it highly replicable. Essay B's methodology is adequate but contains imprecise language like \"about 25 cm\u00b3\" and \"a few cm\u00b3\". Most importantly, Essay A's handling of variables is superior; its table of controlled variables not only lists them but also provides a clear method of control and justifies why controlling them is critical to the experiment's validity. Essay B's justification for variables is more superficial, and its decision not to control the mass of the antacid tablet introduces a significant flaw into the experimental design, conflating the brand with the mass. While both essays present a satisfactory plan, Essay A's is far more rigorous, ambitious, and demonstrates a deeper engagement with the scientific process.",
