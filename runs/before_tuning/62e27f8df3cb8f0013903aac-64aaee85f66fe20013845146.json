  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\", is exceptionally focused and precise, outlining the reaction, conditions, independent variable (temperature), dependent variable (initial rate), measurement technique (colorimetry), and the final unit of calculation. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", is less specific and uses the weaker verb \"investigating.\"\n\nThe background information in Essay A is comprehensive and directly underpins the experimental design, thoroughly explaining the reaction mechanism, rate law, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, which provides a strong theoretical foundation for the methodology. Essay B's background is more descriptive, explaining the components but failing to detail the crucial chemistry of the extraction process, such as the principles of solubility and why dichloromethane is a suitable solvent.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A shines with its inclusion of preliminary testing, which justifies choices like the temperature range and procedural adaptations. Its variable control is meticulous, with clear rationale for each choice. Essay B's methodology describes a standard extraction but omits a common and critical step (adding a base like sodium carbonate to improve caffeine yield and purity), suggesting a less sophisticated understanding of the procedure. While Essay B's safety precautions are noted, Essay A's are far more thorough, presented in a structured table detailing chemical-specific risks, mitigation strategies, and proper environmental disposal\u2014a key aspect that Essay B overlooks for its hazardous solvent.\n\nUltimately, Essay A presents a more complex, well-researched, and rigorously designed investigation, demonstrating a superior grasp of the underlying chemical principles and experimental process.",
