  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it provides a complete and meticulously planned investigation that aligns perfectly with the requirements of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is focused, precise, and includes all necessary parameters. The background section is a major strength, providing personal context, detailed scientific principles of electroplating with chemical equations, and citing relevant prior studies. In contrast, Essay B is structurally incomplete and lacks critical depth; its research question is awkwardly phrased, and it entirely omits a background section, failing to explain the chemical principles of complexometric titration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A excels in its methodology and variable control. It presents a detailed, step-by-step procedure that is easily replicable, and it thoroughly identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, explaining both *why* and *how* each controlled variable will be managed. Essay B's methodology is fragmented and missing crucial details, and it completely fails to identify any controlled variables, which is a significant flaw for a scientific investigation. Finally, Essay A\u2019s risk assessment is specific and thoughtful, addressing chemical disposal in detail, whereas Essay B's is more generic. Overall, Essay A demonstrates a comprehensive, well-researched, and thoughtfully designed experiment, while Essay B appears to be an incomplete draft that misses most of the key components of a successful exploration.",
