  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay A due to its robust and scientifically sound experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, while a standard kinetics investigation, is supported by a meticulous methodology that is appropriate for answering it. The author demonstrates strong planning by including pre-lab calculations for solution preparation, accounting for reagent purity (\"considering the purity of the compound: m = 0.79 g \u00f7 98 % x 100 % = 0.81 g\"), and determining the limiting reactant. The experimental design is robust, using five different temperatures with five trials each, and the control of variables is comprehensive and well-justified.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, presents a more ambitious and original research question but suffers from a fundamentally flawed methodology. The entire premise of the experiment is to compare the d-orbital splitting energy across different metal ions assuming they all form octahedral hexaammine complexes. However, as the student correctly identifies in their evaluation, this assumption is incorrect. The copper complex is square planar (\"[Cu(NH3)4]2+ instead of the assumed [Cu(NH3)6]2+ structure\"), and the iron and manganese sulfates likely underwent oxidation rather than the intended ligand exchange (\"the change in color from both metal complexes... is due to the oxidation of the metal... and was not a result of a ligand exchange reaction\"). While the student's self-awareness of these flaws is commendable (and would score well in Criterion C: Evaluation), it underscores a critical failure in the planning and design phase (Criterion B). The experiment as designed could not produce valid data to answer the research question.\n\nBoth essays feature strong background sections and well-considered safety and environmental sections. However, Essay B's personal engagement is slightly more compelling, and its dedicated \"Assumptions\" section shows a higher level of initial critical thought. Despite these strengths in Essay B, the scientific invalidity of its core procedure makes it significantly weaker in Criterion B. Essay A's methodology is replicable, well-controlled, and appropriately designed to gather valid data, making it the superior example of a well-planned scientific exploration.",
