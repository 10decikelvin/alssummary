  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more focused exploration of its research question, aligning perfectly with the expectations for Criterion B. Its research question is exemplary: \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids...in HCl solutions of varying concentrations...\" is specific, quantitative, and clearly defines all key parameters. In contrast, Essay B's research question is convoluted and relies on a poorly defined independent variable (\"pollution level\" which is qualitatively assessed, not measured). Essay A's methodology is presented with exceptional clarity in a step-by-step format, and crucially includes a \"Pre-test\" section, which shows a sophisticated, iterative approach to experimental design. Essay B's methodology, while chemically complex, is presented as a dense, hard-to-follow block of text. Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of variables is a model of good practice, explaining not just *what* is controlled, but *why* and *how*, whereas Essay B's is a simple list. Finally, the safety and environmental considerations in Essay A are more detailed and specific, particularly regarding waste disposal, compared to the more generic statements in Essay B. While Essay B tackles a more complex titration, its overall planning, focus, and clarity in the exploration phase are significantly weaker than Essay A's.",
