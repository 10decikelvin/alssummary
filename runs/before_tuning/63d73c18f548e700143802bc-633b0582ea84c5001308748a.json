  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and specific, clearly outlining the independent variable (five specific concentration ratios), the dependent variable (buffering capacity), and the method of determination. The background information is thorough, directly relevant, and provides a strong theoretical foundation by discussing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and providing two distinct formulas for buffer capacity, one for experimental calculation and one for theoretical comparison. The methodology is a standout feature; it details a replicable, hands-on experiment with a well-justified table of controlled variables and a comprehensive risk assessment covering safety, environmental, and ethical aspects.\n\nEssay B, while having a strong personal rationale and a valid database-driven methodology, is weaker in several key areas. It poses two separate, simpler research questions rather than one integrated one. The methodology section correctly identifies reliable databases and outlines data processing, which is appropriate for its type of investigation. However, a major and critical weakness is the complete omission of a formal section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. While the environmental context is discussed in the rationale, failing to formally address these points as part of the experimental design is a significant oversight for Criterion B. Therefore, Essay A's meticulous experimental design, superior structure, and complete fulfillment of all aspects of Criterion B make it the better essay.",
