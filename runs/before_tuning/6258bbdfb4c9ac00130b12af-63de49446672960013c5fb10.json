  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of exploration by tackling a more complex analytical challenge and showcasing significant personal engagement in the methodological development. While Essay A presents a well-structured and competent investigation using standard titration techniques, its approach is more conventional. Essay B's strength lies in its excellent background research and the subsequent problem-solving detailed in its \"Development and pilot studies\" section. The author identifies a critical issue\u2014the analyte (Vitamin B6) being colorless and thus unsuitable for direct UV-Vis spectrometry\u2014and devises a sophisticated, multi-step solution involving complexation with copper(II) ions and micelle formation with SDS to prevent precipitation. This demonstrates a deep understanding of advanced chemical principles like Crystal Field Theory and surfactant chemistry, far exceeding the standard hydrolysis concepts in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B's justification for its methodological choices is grounded in scientific literature, as seen when it references \"Khudhair et al (2019)\" to select the optimal copper(II) sulfate concentration. Although Essay A has a slightly better-formatted table for controlled variables and safety, the intellectual initiative, creativity, and depth of chemical understanding displayed in Essay B's exploration make it the stronger piece.",
