  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly stronger than Essay A in every aspect of Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a precise relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In contrast, Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased as a statement: \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\". Essay B provides extensive, well-researched background information on plastics, bioplastics, and the chemical principles of Young's Modulus, demonstrating genuine engagement. Essay A's background is almost non-existent, offering only a single generic sentence about titration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining specific quantities, equipment (including uncertainties), and a replicable procedure that incorporates technology like Vernier LabQuest and Tracker software for enhanced accuracy. Essay A's method is a simple list of steps lacking crucial details like sample preparation. Essay B also excels in its identification and control of variables, presenting them in a clear table that justifies the control measures and explains their potential impact on the results, even acknowledging uncontrolled variables. Essay A fails to explicitly define any controlled variables. Finally, Essay B presents a comprehensive risk assessment that thoughtfully addresses safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, whereas Essay A's assessment is limited to basic safety and a brief mention of waste disposal.",
