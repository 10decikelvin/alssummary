  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed plans for their investigations. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of chemical understanding and methodological rigor, making it the stronger of the two for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's primary weakness lies in its background information. While it effectively explains the concepts of bioplastics and Young's Modulus, it fails to provide a chemical rationale for its research question. There is no explanation of how or why sodium bicarbonate would affect the polymer's structure and, consequently, its elasticity. This omission weakens the link between the chemical theory and the experimental design. Nevertheless, Essay A excels in its detailed methodology, its thorough consideration of controlled and uncontrolled variables in clear tables, and its thoughtful inclusion of safety, environmental, and ethical aspects.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, provides a comprehensive and highly relevant chemical background. It expertly connects concepts like kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, redox reactions (in bleaching and titration), and collision theory directly to the research question. The decision to first determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach through titration shows a sophisticated level of planning and an understanding of the need for precision. The methodology is clear, the variables are well-justified, and the safety precautions are specific and thorough. While Essay A's inclusion of \"uncontrolled variables\" is a good feature, Essay B's overall depth of chemical theory and the proactive step of standardizing a reactant make it a more convincing and well-explored experimental plan.",
