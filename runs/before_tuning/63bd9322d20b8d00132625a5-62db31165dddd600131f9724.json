  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide competent explorations of their chosen research questions, demonstrating a grasp of scientific investigation. However, Report B is superior due to its more sophisticated and well-defined research question, which investigates the impact of temperature on ascorbic acid concentration in lemon juice. This allows for a deeper exploration of chemical principles, such as reaction kinetics and the properties of vitamins, as evidenced by the inclusion of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve and chemical equations. In contrast, Report A's investigation into the effect of stearin concentration on candle burn time is simpler and lacks the same depth of chemical theory. While Report A includes a more structured table of variables, Report B's methodology appears more controlled and scientifically rigorous, aiming to quantify a specific chemical change rather than just observing a physical phenomenon. Furthermore, the inclusion of a clear hypothesis and detailed background information in Report B demonstrates a stronger conceptual foundation for the experiment. Although both reports could be improved, Report B's more ambitious scope and deeper scientific engagement make it the stronger of the two.",
