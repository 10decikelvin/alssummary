  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the scientific process and experimental design required for Criterion B. The background information in Essay A is excellent; it provides a strong global context (Paris Agreement, global warming) and then delves into the specific chemical principles, such as Le Chatelier's Principle, that govern the phenomenon being studied. It also masterfully justifies the chosen methodology by comparing the Winkler method to alternatives like sensors and colorimetric tests. In contrast, Essay B's research question is convoluted and relies on a poorly defined independent variable, \"pollution level,\" which is justified through observation rather than quantitative measurement, making the investigation inherently subjective.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is a model of clarity and logic. The procedure is presented in clear, sequential steps that are easy to replicate, and it includes a section on preliminary trials, which indicates a thoughtful and iterative approach to experimental design. The identification and control of variables in Essay A are explicit and appropriate (e.g., using water from the same tap to control salinity). Essay B's methodology is disorganized, confusingly blending reagent preparation, titrant standardization, and the actual experimental procedure into a single narrative, which makes it very difficult to follow. Additionally, Essay B's control of variables is weak; for example, it assumes the temperature of all samples is constant at room temperature, which is a significant uncontrolled variable when collecting samples from different outdoor locations. While both essays have adequate risk assessments, Essay A's overall scientific rigor, from the focused research question to the well-structured procedure, is far superior.",
