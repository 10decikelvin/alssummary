  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the core components of IB Criterion B: Exploration. Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement across all key areas.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created,\" is more focused, original, and shows greater personal engagement than Essay A's. The background for Essay B is exemplary; it not only explains the relevant chemistry (Maillard reaction, AGEs, colorimetry) but also situates the research within existing literature, identifying a specific gap concerning real foods versus model foods. In contrast, Essay A's question, while valid, addresses a very standard textbook topic (Hess's Law and hydration enthalpies), and its background, though correct, is less sophisticated.\n\nSecond, the methodology and variable control in Essay B are far superior. Essay B presents a complex, multi-stage procedure that is meticulously detailed and controlled. The use of a table to explicitly list controlled variables, the method of their control, and their potential impact on results is a hallmark of a high-quality exploration. Conversely, Essay A contains a critical flaw in its identification of variables, incorrectly swapping the independent (\"Temperature change\") and dependent variables. This fundamental misunderstanding significantly weakens the experimental design.\n\nFurthermore, the initial experimental design in Essay A proved to be inadequate, as the student later discovered the temperature changes were too small to be meaningful due to low concentrations. While the troubleshooting described in the evaluation is commendable, it highlights a weakness in the initial planning phase (Exploration). Essay B's methodology appears robust and well-conceived from the outset to generate viable data. Finally, while both essays provide adequate safety considerations, the overall quality of the research design, scientific context, and variable management in Essay B is clearly at a higher level, making it the better submission for Criterion B.",
