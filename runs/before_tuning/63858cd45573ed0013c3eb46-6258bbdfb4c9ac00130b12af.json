  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, making this a difficult decision. Essay A is commendable for its clear, focused research question and its creative approach to a standard kinetics experiment. The background information is concise and directly relevant, and the justification for using six data points and two dependent variable measurements (time to 150mL and 200mL) shows strong personal engagement and critical thinking. The control of variables is particularly impressive, with specific, quantifiable measures like \"200 turns at medium pressure\" for standardizing the catalyst's surface area.\n\nHowever, Essay B presents a more ambitious and technically complex investigation. While its research question is phrased less elegantly than Essay A's, the overall exploration is more rigorous. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, including procedures for preparing and standardizing multiple reagents, which demonstrates a deep understanding of advanced practical chemistry. The justification for the methodology is robust, explaining the choice of temperature range, reagent concentrations, and apparatus. Furthermore, the risk assessment in Essay B is more comprehensive due to the greater number of hazards involved (flammable solvents, corrosive reagents, heating oil). The sheer scope and meticulous planning required for successfully executing the two distinct titrations (for Acid Value and Saponification Value) give Essay B a slight edge in demonstrating the depth of exploration required at a high level.\n\nIn summary, Essay A is an excellent example of a well-designed and creative investigation into a core syllabus topic. Essay B, on the other hand, tackles a more challenging topic with a level of procedural detail and justification that reflects a slightly superior command of experimental design and chemical principles.",
