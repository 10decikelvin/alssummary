  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it provides a comprehensive and meticulously planned exploration, characteristic of a high-achieving IB student. Its research question is highly specific, including the exact temperatures and uncertainties, which sets a rigorous tone from the outset. The \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section is a standout feature, demonstrating authentic personal engagement and iterative experimental design by detailing the process of selecting a measurement device and justifying changes to the procedure based on preliminary trials and equipment limitations. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only identifying the variables but also providing a clear rationale for their control and the specific method of control. The safety and environmental section is also excellent, identifying specific chemical hazards and thoughtfully explaining how the experiment's scale was reduced to minimize waste.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a decent introduction with good personal context and relevant background theory on redox titrations, is critically incomplete. The methodology section is truncated, providing an unfinished variables table and completely omitting the procedure, apparatus list, and safety considerations. The research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is generic and lacks the precision of Essay A's. While the background chemistry is sound, the essay fails to demonstrate the depth of planning, justification, and attention to detail that is evident throughout Essay A. Therefore, Essay A's thorough, well-justified, and complete approach to the exploration phase makes it significantly superior.",
