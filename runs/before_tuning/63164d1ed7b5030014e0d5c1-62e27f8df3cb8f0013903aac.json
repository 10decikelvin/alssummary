  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger in its fulfilment of Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and detailed, immediately outlining the independent variable (temperature), dependent variable (initial rate measured by colorimetry), and the ultimate goal (calculating activation energy). The background information in Essay B is exceptionally thorough, linking concepts like reaction mechanisms, rate laws, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation directly to the experimental design, which is a hallmark of a sophisticated investigation. In contrast, while Essay A's research question is clear, its background is more descriptive than explanatory and lacks the same depth of theoretical justification.\n\nThe methodology is where Essay B truly excels. It explicitly includes a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies crucial methodological choices, such as the temperature range and the decision not to cap the cuvettes. This demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative experimental design process. Essay B's table of controlled variables is also more comprehensive, providing clear explanations for *why* each variable must be controlled and *how* this will be achieved. Essay A's methodology is replicable, but it lacks this level of refinement and justification.\n\nFinally, Essay B's treatment of safety and environmental considerations is far superior. It presents a detailed, chemical-specific risk assessment in a table, identifying hazards and outlining clear mitigation strategies, including proper disposal methods. Essay A's risk assessment is generic and weak, particularly its dismissal of environmental concerns by stating \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which is insufficient for an IB Chemistry investigation involving chemical reagents like iodine.",
