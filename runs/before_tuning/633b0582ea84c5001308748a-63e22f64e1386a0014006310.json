  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The reasoning for this decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards for Exploration. Essay B presents a more robust and well-considered investigation plan. Its two-part research question, which investigates both the effect of carbon chain length and isomeric classification (primary, secondary, tertiary) on the enthalpy of combustion, is more sophisticated and demonstrates a higher level of inquiry than Essay A's simpler, albeit clear, questions.\n\nEssay B's methodology is a standout feature; as a hands-on experiment, it requires significantly more detailed planning. The essay excels by providing a clear, step-by-step procedure, a complete list of materials, and an outstanding section on variables. The controlled variables are meticulously presented in a table, with explicit justifications and methods of control for each one, such as using the \"same calorimeter for every trial\" because \"different calorimeters may possess different specific heat capacities.\" This level of detail in experimental design is exemplary. Furthermore, Essay B includes a thorough and practical safety assessment, identifying specific risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" and providing concrete protective measures, which is a critical component of a well-planned experiment.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is a well-written database investigation with strong background information that effectively links the chemical principles to a real-world context of sustainable fuels. Its research questions are focused and its methodology for data collection from sources like NIST is appropriate. However, its overall scope of exploration is narrower. The section on controlled variables is less detailed than Essay B's, and it completely omits a dedicated safety and ethics section, which is a notable weakness even for a database study (where it could be noted that direct experimental risks are not a factor).\n\nUltimately, Essay B is superior because it demonstrates a more comprehensive and meticulous approach to the scientific process. The complexity of its research question, the detailed articulation of its experimental design and variable control, and the thorough consideration of safety protocols reflect a deeper and more engaged exploration, fully meeting the highest standards of Criterion B.",
