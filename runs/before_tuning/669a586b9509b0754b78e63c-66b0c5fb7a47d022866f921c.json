  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a superior approach to Criterion B. The research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying not only the independent and dependent variables but also the exact concentrations, quantities, and duration of the experiment. The background information provides a clear link between the real-world context (pharmacology) and the underlying chemical principles (neutralization reactions, collision theory). The methodology is a key strength; the inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section shows a high level of engagement and scientific thinking, as the student used preliminary results to refine the concentration range and observation time. Furthermore, the controlled variables are presented in a comprehensive table with excellent justifications for why and how each is controlled.\n\nEssay B is also a strong submission with excellent real-world context (biofuels) and personal engagement. The research question is focused, and the safety and environmental considerations are well-handled. However, it contains several weaknesses compared to Essay A. The description of the dependent variable as \"The total mass of the fuel burnt\" is imprecise; the mass burnt is a measurement used to *calculate* the enthalpy of combustion, which is the actual dependent variable. The methodology relies on commercial gasoline (E10), which the student correctly identifies is not pure octane, introducing a significant and uncontrolled variable that complicates the interpretation of results. While the student acknowledges this limitation, the experimental design in Essay A is inherently more controlled and scientifically rigorous from the outset. Overall, Essay A's meticulous planning, refined methodology, and clarity in all sections make it the better of the two.",
