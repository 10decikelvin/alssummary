  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more sophisticated exploration (Criterion B) than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"To what extent does temperature effect the concentration of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) in Nature\u2019s Own tablets (200 mg)?\", is highly focused and sets a clear scope for a controlled experiment. In contrast, Essay B's question about how NaCl affects dissolved oxygen \"from different water sources\" introduces a second, poorly controlled variable (the water source), which weakens the focus of the investigation.\n\nThe background information in Essay A is exemplary; it connects the real-world relevance of Vitamin B6 to a detailed theoretical foundation, including the Beer-Lambert law and an impressive application of Crystal Field Theory to justify the use of a copper(II) complex for colorimetric analysis. Essay B provides a competent but descriptive background on the Winkler method, lacking the explanatory depth of why salinity affects dissolved oxygen. A major strength of Essay A is its \"Development and pilot studies\" section, which demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to refining the methodology by identifying and solving problems like precipitate formation. Essay B's methodology is presented as a list of steps without this crucial justification or evidence of preliminary work.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's identification and justification of controlled variables are far more detailed and specific, showing a deep understanding of potential sources of error (e.g., \"The same cuvette will be used... as different cuvettes may absorb different amounts of light\"). While Essay B identifies its variables, the justification is generic. Finally, Essay B includes an entire \"Evaluation\" section within its methodology, which is a significant structural error and indicates a misunderstanding of the IA format. While both essays have adequate safety considerations, Essay A's overall scientific rigor, depth of understanding, and methodological development are clearly superior.",
