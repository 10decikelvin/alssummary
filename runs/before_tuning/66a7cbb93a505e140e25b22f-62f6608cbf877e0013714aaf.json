  "reasoning": "Both essays present a competent and well-structured approach to their respective investigations, fulfilling the requirements for Criterion B. Essay A provides a clear and focused research question about antacid effectiveness, supported by relevant background information that includes correctly balanced chemical equations for each reaction. The methodology is straightforward, replicable, and the variables are correctly identified with sound justifications, such as using preliminary trials to determine the HCl concentration. This represents a solid and complete piece of experimental design.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific engagement and sophistication. The research question, which investigates the relationship between temperature and the rate constant, is more complex and ambitious. The background section is exceptional, not only explaining the relevant concepts but also deriving the integrated rate law and presenting the Arrhenius equation, which forms the theoretical backbone of the entire investigation. This seamless integration of advanced chemical theory into the experimental plan is a key strength. The methodology, involving a multi-step process of reaction, sampling, quenching, and titration, is necessarily more complex but is well-designed and appropriate for determining the derived dependent variable (the rate constant, k). While Essay A is a very good example of a standard IB investigation, Essay B's depth of theoretical understanding and its more intricate experimental design make it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
