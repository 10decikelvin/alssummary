  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide some level of analysis and evaluation of their experimental procedures. However, Student B offers a more detailed and insightful assessment of their experiment's limitations and potential improvements. They correctly identify both systematic and random errors, such as heat loss and imprecise equipment, and quantify their impact on the results, even referencing a specific data point (the 85% percentage error). The proposed improvements are also more specific and practical, like suggesting a draught shield or a digital probe. Student A's evaluation is more superficial, mentioning that calorimeters were 'old' and the power supply was 'overloaded' without deeply explaining how this affected the data or proposing robust solutions. While Student A's hypothesis was supported, the depth and rigor of the evaluation and conclusion section in Student B's work demonstrate a stronger grasp of scientific methodology.",
