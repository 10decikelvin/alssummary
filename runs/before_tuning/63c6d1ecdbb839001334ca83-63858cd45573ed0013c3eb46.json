  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for the Exploration criterion. They both present clear, focused, and well-justified research questions that are appropriate for the IB Chemistry curriculum.\n\nEssay B is particularly commendable for its excellent organization, using tables effectively to outline variables and its thoughtful \"Design\" section which justifies the chosen methodology against more conventional alternatives. The discussion of heterogeneous catalysis and active sites is clear and directly relevant.\n\nHowever, Essay A has a slight edge due to a greater depth in its scientific context and procedural planning. The background information not only connects the chemistry to a real-world application (anemia) but also includes a stoichiometric calculation to justify the concentration of the titrant being used. This demonstrates a superior level of foresight and quantitative reasoning. Furthermore, the \"What was changed\" section provides explicit evidence of preliminary trials and methodological refinement, which is a hallmark of a well-executed exploration. While Essay B's control of variables is very good, Essay A's method is arguably more complex, and the justification for all aspects of the procedure, including the challenges and adaptations, is more thorough and reflective of a deeper engagement with the experimental process.",
