  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger performance on Criterion B. Its research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is focused and well-defined. The background information is scientifically robust, clearly explaining the nature of Vitamin C, the redox titration mechanism with iodine (including a balanced chemical equation), and the function of the starch indicator. In contrast, Essay A's background provides a weaker scientific justification for its hypothesis, relying on a vague analogy to NaCl solutions.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant differentiator. Essay B provides a detailed, replicable, step-by-step procedure, including specific values for the independent variable (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes) and clear instructions for sample preparation and titration. Essay A's procedure is vague, failing to specify the range of concentrations to be tested, simply stating to \"Repeat step 1 up to 10 for the remaining masses of KNO3\". Furthermore, Essay A's exploration section is poorly structured, including an \"Evaluation\" section that discusses broken equipment (\"A variable resistor was not working\"), which fundamentally undermines the viability of the proposed method.\n\nFinally, Essay B's risk assessment is superior. It identifies specific hazards related to heating glassware and handling iodine solution. Essay A's safety precautions are generic and superficial, failing to mention the specific chemical hazards of potassium nitrate. While both essays correctly identify variables, Essay B's overall planning, detail, and scientific grounding are of a much higher quality.",
