  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundations for a scientific investigation. Essay B provides a more detailed and well-referenced background, thoroughly explaining the chemical principles behind oxygen solubility and the \"salting out\" effect. Its safety section is also commendable for its chemical-specific risk assessment.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior in its overall experimental design and planning, which is the core of the Exploration criterion. Its research question is well-focused and justified with real-world context (E10, E85 fuels). The methodology is exceptionally well-structured, featuring a clear, justified list of apparatus, precise instructions for preparing solutions via serial dilution, and a step-by-step procedure for the calorimetry. Crucially, Essay A includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear explanations for *why* and *how* each is controlled, demonstrating a deeper level of planning. It also includes a thoughtful section on assumptions and potential limitations, which shows a higher degree of critical thinking about the experimental process itself. While Essay B's procedure is adequate, it lacks a dedicated materials/apparatus list and is slightly less detailed, making it harder to replicate precisely. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and meticulously planned investigation.",
