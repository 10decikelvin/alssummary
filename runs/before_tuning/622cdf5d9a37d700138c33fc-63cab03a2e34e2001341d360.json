  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher quality of exploration (Criterion B) compared to Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created,\" is focused, precise, and establishes a clear quantitative relationship between the variables. In contrast, Essay B's research question is convoluted and its independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is qualitative and poorly defined, relying on subjective observations rather than a measurable parameter. Essay A provides excellent background information that clearly identifies a gap in existing research and uses scientific principles like the Beer-Lambert Law to justify its methodology, showcasing strong personal engagement and scientific curiosity. While Essay B's background is adequate and explains the Winkler method, its connection between the global context and the specific experiment is less direct.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is well-structured and the control of variables is exemplary, presented in a detailed table that explains not only *how* variables are controlled but also *why* it is important. Essay B lists its controlled variables simply as \"Constants\" and acknowledges significant uncontrolled factors as \"Assumptions\" (e.g., temperature, pH), which is a weaker approach to experimental design. Although Essay B has a more thorough and detailed risk assessment, which is a notable strength, the overall scientific planning, clarity of purpose, and methodological justification in Essay A are far superior. Essay A's plan is more scientifically rigorous and demonstrates a deeper understanding of experimental design, making it the stronger piece of work for Criterion B.",
