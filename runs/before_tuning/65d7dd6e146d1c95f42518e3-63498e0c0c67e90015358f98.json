  "reasoning": "The provided text is an excerpt from a student's IA. It is not possible to compare two documents. The student has provided a clear statement of the research question and context. The methodology is outlined, but lacks specific details on temperature control and measurement consistency. For example, it mentions a hot plate was used, but not the specific temperature settings for each trial. The student identifies potential sources of error such as contamination and evaporation, and offers some valid suggestions for improvement like using a timer for readings and ensuring clean equipment. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by discussing the limitations of the Beer-Lambert law in this context, especially concerning the potential for chemical interactions between CaSO\u2084 and MgCl\u2082 that might affect absorbance readings independently of solubility. The suggestion to use a conductometric method is good, showing an understanding of alternative experimental approaches. The overall structure is sound, but the analysis would benefit from deeper scientific reasoning regarding the chosen methods and their limitations.",
