  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed plans for their investigations, demonstrating a good grasp of the scientific method required for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is precise, clearly identifying the independent variable (MgCl\u2082 concentration), dependent variable (solubility of CaSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O), and the method of determination (Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law). The background information provides excellent context, linking the investigation to a real-world application (fertilizers) and thoroughly explaining the underlying chemical principle of the \"diverse ion effect.\" The methodology is particularly strong; it includes a dedicated calibration experiment, a comprehensive table of controlled variables with justifications, and a clear, replicable procedure. The inclusion of centrifugation to remove particulates shows foresight and attention to detail.\n\nEssay B also formulates a strong, focused research question investigating the effect of different catalysts on activation energy. The background information clearly explains the relevant theory, including the Arrhenius equation and the concept of pKa, providing a solid theoretical basis for the hypothesis. The methodology is detailed, with clear instructions for preparing solutions and carrying out the reaction at various temperatures. The safety and environmental considerations are particularly thorough. However, the method for determining the reaction rate relies on visual observation of a color change timed with a smartphone, which introduces a significant source of subjective and random error compared to the instrumental method used in Essay A.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a slightly more sophisticated and robust experimental design. The choice of spectrophotometry with a calibration curve is a more precise and objective method for data collection than the visual timing method in Essay B. Additionally, the table of controlled variables in Essay A, which includes not just *how* but also *why* each variable is controlled, demonstrates a deeper level of planning and understanding of the experimental system. Therefore, Essay A is the stronger of the two.",
