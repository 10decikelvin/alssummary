  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough approach to the experimental design, fulfilling the requirements of Criterion B to a much higher standard. The research question in Essay B is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations of bleach to be investigated. Its background information section is comprehensive, integrating relevant chemical principles like the Beer-Lambert law, reaction kinetics, collision theory, and even the complex redox titration chemistry required to determine the initial bleach concentration\u2014a crucial preliminary step that showcases excellent planning. The methodology is meticulous, with clearly defined independent, dependent, and controlled variables presented in a detailed table that explains not only *what* is being controlled but *why* it's significant and *how* it will be controlled. The inclusion of a \"Pre-Test\" section to determine the optimal wavelength and initial reactant concentration is a hallmark of a well-considered and scientifically rigorous investigation.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A, while having a valid and interesting research question, shows significant weaknesses in its experimental design. Most critically, it incorrectly identifies the independent and dependent variables, stating that \"Temperature change\" is the independent variable and \"Different types of substances\" is the dependent variable. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design. The procedure lacks crucial details, such as how the temperature change would be accurately determined from the raw data (e.g., through graphical extrapolation, which the evaluation later admits was not done). While the background theory is adequate, it is less detailed and applied than in Essay B. The evaluation section of Essay A is essentially a chronicle of a failed experimental design, highlighting the very flaws in methodology that Criterion B assesses, which confirms the initial plan was not robust enough. Therefore, Essay B's proactive, detailed, and scientifically sound planning makes it unequivocally the better of the two.",
