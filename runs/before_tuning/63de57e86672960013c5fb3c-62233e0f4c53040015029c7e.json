  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration (Criterion B) than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is focused, clear, and includes specific parameters for the independent variable. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"How does the change in temperature of Acetate buffer affect the pH of the Acetate buffer when Sodium hydroxide is added?\", is ambiguously worded, making the precise relationship under investigation unclear. Essay A also provides a compelling personal context (jewellery making) and backs its hypothesis with extensive, cited background research that clearly explains the underlying chemistry and references previous studies. Essay B's background is less developed and its personal connection feels more generic.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the methodology. Essay A's procedure is logical, sequential, and detailed enough to be replicated easily. Its variables (independent, dependent, and controlled) are explicitly identified, with clear justifications for why and how they will be controlled. For instance, it explains that the \"distance between the electrodes\" will be controlled by using a marked wooden splint. Conversely, Essay B's methodology is extremely disorganized, with procedural steps presented out of chronological order (e.g., \"\u2460 Prepare NaCH\u2083COO\" followed by \"\u2464 Set up the burette\" and \"\u2465 Heat up the buffer solution\" before the main buffer is prepared in \"\u2463\"). This makes the experimental plan very difficult to follow. Furthermore, Essay A includes a comprehensive and thoughtful risk assessment that covers safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific disposal instructions, whereas Essay B's safety section is incomplete and lacks any environmental or ethical discussion.",
