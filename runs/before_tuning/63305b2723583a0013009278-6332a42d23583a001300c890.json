  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a strong understanding of the scientific method and present well-structured investigations appropriate for the IB Chemistry level.\n\nEssay A's strength lies in its meticulous and clear methodology. The research question is sharply focused, specifying the exact voltages to be tested and the duration of the experiment. The \"Controlled Variables\" table is exemplary, not only listing the variables but explicitly stating *how* each one was controlled. This demonstrates a thorough consideration of the experimental design. The personal engagement is genuine and provides good context. The safety considerations are also well-detailed and practical. A minor weakness is that the theoretical background could have more explicitly linked the independent variable (voltage) to the variable in Faraday's Law (current) via Ohm's Law, though this is alluded to in the hypothesis.\n\nEssay B is also very strong, tackling a more conceptually advanced topic in chemical kinetics. The background information provides a good overview of the relevant theories, including the Arrhenius equation. The procedure is detailed, and the inclusion of calculations for solution preparation, including purity, is excellent. However, the methodology has a significant assumption: it states the orders of reaction are 1 and 1 based on an external source without experimental verification. For an investigation into reaction rates, determining or justifying the rate law is a critical component. While acceptable, this slightly undermines the \"Exploration\" aspect compared to Essay A, which investigates a more direct relationship. Furthermore, the phrasing of the research question as a \"yes/no\" question is slightly weaker than Essay A's \"How does...\" format.\n\nOverall, while both are high-quality, Essay A demonstrates a slightly more rigorous and well-controlled experimental design within its scope. The way it explicitly details the control of variables gives it a marginal edge in the \"Exploration\" criterion.",
