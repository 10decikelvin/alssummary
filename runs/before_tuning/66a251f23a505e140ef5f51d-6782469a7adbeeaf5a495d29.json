  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B. Essay B's personal engagement and rationale are outstanding, clearly linking the investigation to real-world environmental problems and identifying a specific research gap, stating \"This lack of information further highlights the importance of my research, in filling research gaps that currently exist.\" Essay A also provides excellent context, but its strength lies in its comprehensive theoretical background, integrating concepts like Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Le Chatelier's principle to build a robust foundation for the research question.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates superior methodological rigor. Its procedure is meticulously planned, including a distinct \"Part A\" dedicated to creating a calibration curve, which is essential for accurate quantitative analysis using colorimetry. The student notes, \"This calibration curve was useful for part B of the experiment, where the reaction was carried out several times at different temperatures.\" In contrast, Essay B justifies omitting this crucial step, stating, \"due to time constraints, a standard curve could not be obtained.\" While the justification is explained, it represents a methodological shortcut that makes its approach slightly less robust than Essay A's.\n\nFurthermore, both essays show excellent personal input through detailed preliminary experiments that led to significant methodological refinements. Essay A's variables are exceptionally well-controlled and justified in a comprehensive table, and its safety considerations are highly specific to the chemicals used, for instance noting that for potassium thiocyanate, \"Contact with acids liberates toxic gas.\" While Essay B also does a good job, Essay A's overall experimental design feels more complete and scientifically rigorous from start to finish. Therefore, due to its more thorough methodology and detailed integration of theory, Essay A is marginally better.",
