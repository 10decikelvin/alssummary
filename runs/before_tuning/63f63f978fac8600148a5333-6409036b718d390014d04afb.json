  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of achievement for Criterion B, but Essay A presents a more rigorously designed and justified investigation. Essay A's research question is impeccably focused, and its background section provides a detailed chemical rationale for every major decision, particularly the selection of the acidic pH range to avoid the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082. This direct link between established chemical principles and methodological design is a significant strength. Furthermore, Essay A's dedicated \"Preliminary Trials\" section explicitly details the iterative process of refining the methodology, such as determining the contact time and adding a centrifugation step, which showcases superior personal engagement and scientific foresight. Essay B's topic on the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction is ambitious and its introduction provides excellent real-world context; however, its background chemistry is slightly more general, linking temperature to overall reaction kinetics rather than the specific BZ mechanism in great detail. While Essay B features an exemplary safety and environmental section, which is more detailed than Essay A's, the core of Criterion B\u2014the scientific exploration and design\u2014is more robustly demonstrated in Essay A. The variables table in Essay A, with its detailed chemical justifications for each control (e.g., the effect of temperature on pectin breakdown), is more thorough than that of Essay B, tipping the balance in its favor.",
