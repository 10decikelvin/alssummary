  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong plans that would likely score well in Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of chemical understanding and more insightful planning.\n\nEssay A provides a clear and focused research question, though it is slightly awkwardly phrased. Its strength lies in its meticulous identification of controlled variables, with detailed methods for control and justifications. The safety section is also exceptionally thorough. However, the description of the dependent variable is confusingly stated as \"The volume of EDTA\" when the method described is a back titration where the volume of MgCl\u2082 solution would be measured. Furthermore, while the background chemistry is adequate, it's a standard titration procedure applied to a food sample.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, tackles a more complex and conceptually richer topic from the IB Chemistry syllabus: d-orbital splitting in transition metal complexes. The research question is sophisticated and precise. The background section provides excellent theoretical context, clearly explaining d-orbital splitting, ligand exchange reactions, and the spectrochemical series, demonstrating a strong grasp of the underlying principles. The methodology is appropriate, and the choice of variables is well-justified. The most impressive aspect is the \"Limitations of the Methodology\" section, which, while technically part of the evaluation, showcases a profound, pre-emptive understanding of potential issues. The author foresees complex chemical problems like the competing oxidation of Fe\u00b2\u207a and Mn\u00b2\u207a under alkaline conditions and the Jahn-Teller effect causing the copper complex to adopt a square planar geometry, which are very nuanced considerations that significantly impact the validity of the proposed experiment. This level of critical thinking about the experimental design itself elevates Essay B above Essay A.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A presents a competent and well-organized plan, Essay B showcases a deeper engagement with complex chemical theory and a more critical and insightful approach to designing the experiment.",
