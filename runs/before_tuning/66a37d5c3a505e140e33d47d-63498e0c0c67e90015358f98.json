  "reasoning": "This is a close comparison as both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B. Essay A presents a well-structured and classic investigation. Its research question is clear, the background information on Vitamin C and redox titrations is relevant and detailed, and the procedure is straightforward and replicable. A significant strength of Essay A is its thorough and thoughtful consideration of \"Safety, ethical and environmental issues,\" addressing potential burns from the heating plate, food waste ethics, and energy consumption. However, the methodology, while sound, is standard, and there is a minor conceptual error in listing \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable when it functions as a second independent variable for comparison.\n\nEssay B, while weaker in one specific area, demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and methodological sophistication overall. Its research question is focused, and the background on the \"diverse ion effect\" is more complex and well-supported by literature. The experimental design is a key strength; the inclusion of a preliminary calibration experiment to determine the maximum wavelength (\u03bb_max) and the use of a centrifuge to prevent sedimentation are \"thoughtful and show a thorough awareness of the potential limitations of the technique chosen,\" which is a hallmark of an excellent exploration. While its safety section is brief and it completely omits ethical and environmental considerations\u2014a notable flaw\u2014the proactive and sophisticated approach to designing a valid and reliable procedure for a more complex topic makes it superior. The meticulous planning in Essay B indicates a deeper engagement with the scientific process and potential sources of error, outweighing the omissions and the solid-but-standard approach of Essay A.",
