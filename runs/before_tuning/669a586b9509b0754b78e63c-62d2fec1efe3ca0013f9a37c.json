  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and appropriate investigations for the IB Chemistry level. However, Essay A demonstrates a slightly superior approach to the experimental design and methodology, which is the core of Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations and measurements to be taken. Its methodology is meticulous, clearly outlining how each variable will be controlled with strong justifications. The inclusion of a preliminary test (\"Pre-test\") to determine the optimal concentration range is a hallmark of excellent scientific practice and exploration. Furthermore, the safety and environmental considerations are thorough, even including stoichiometric calculations to justify the quantities used and minimize waste.\n\nEssay B investigates a more complex concept (activation energy) and provides a good theoretical background using the Arrhenius equation. Its procedure is logical and includes appropriate safety precautions. However, the methodology has some weaknesses. For instance, using 50ml burettes for 2ml volumes introduces significant uncertainty, a flaw the student correctly identifies in their evaluation but could have addressed in the initial design by choosing more appropriate glassware like pipettes. While varying temperature is key, the method for controlling it precisely at the moment of reaction isn't fully detailed.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay B tackles a more conceptually advanced topic, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough, careful, and well-justified experimental design. The attention to detail in controlling variables, the justification for the chosen range based on preliminary work, and the proactive approach to waste minimization make it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
