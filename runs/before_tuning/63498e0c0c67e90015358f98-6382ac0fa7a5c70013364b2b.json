  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger exploration (Criterion B) than Essay B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is focused, clear, and investigates a sophisticated chemical principle (the diverse ion effect). This is supported by excellent, relevant background information on solvation, ionic strength, and charge density, which provides a strong theoretical foundation for the investigation. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is highly appropriate and well-planned, incorporating a calibration curve and centrifugation, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the requirements for accurate spectrophotometric analysis. The controlled variables are meticulously identified in a table with clear justifications and methods of control, such as using a magnetic stirrer with a temperature function to maintain a constant 40\u00b0C because \"Solubility increases with increase in temperature\".\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's exploration is weaker. The research question, which compares three substances using two different methods, is less focused and feels like two separate investigations combined. While the ambition is commendable, the execution in the planning stage is flawed. The background information is more superficial and lacks the scientific depth seen in Essay A. Crucially, the experimental design has a significant methodological flaw: using a Bunsen burner for thermal decomposition, which, as the student later admits, cannot reach the required temperature for complete decomposition of CaCO\u2083. This indicates a lack of sufficient preliminary research. Essay B also misidentifies the independent variable as \"Mass of sample\" rather than the source of the sample, and the method of controlling temperature for decomposition (\"the same Bunsen Burner\") is inadequate. While Essay B has a slightly better safety and environmental section, Essay A's overall scientific rigor, clarity of purpose, and well-designed methodology make its exploration far superior.",
