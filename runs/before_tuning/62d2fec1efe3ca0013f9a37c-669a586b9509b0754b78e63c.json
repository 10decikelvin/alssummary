  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundations for a scientific investigation. Essay A tackles a conceptually more complex topic by aiming to determine the activation energy for a reaction with different catalysts, which requires understanding and applying the Arrhenius equation. Its background information correctly links reaction rates to activation energy and provides the relevant chemical theory. However, its methodology has a significant flaw in its temperature control procedure, where reagents at different temperatures are mixed in a room-temperature test tube, which would inevitably affect the accuracy of the temperature measurement for each trial. The student acknowledges this in their evaluation, but it remains a weakness in the experimental design itself.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, demonstrates a more meticulous and thorough approach to experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. The research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations to be tested. The methodology is detailed and includes a diagram of the apparatus, making it easily replicable. A key strength is the inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section, which justifies the choice of concentrations and the duration of the experiment, showcasing a reflective and scientific approach to refining the procedure. The discussion of controlled variables and safety considerations is also more comprehensive, with a detailed table outlining hazards and a thoughtful justification for the quantities of reagents used to minimize waste. While the topic of antacid reactivity is simpler than calculating activation energy, the quality of the experimental plan and the depth of the procedural thinking in Essay B are superior.\n\nOverall, Essay B is stronger because it presents a more robust, well-justified, and carefully considered experimental plan. The inclusion of preliminary testing and the detailed, thoughtful control of variables and safety protocols demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the practical aspects of the investigation.",
