  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B, featuring clear research questions, relevant background information, and appropriate safety considerations. Essay A presents a well-structured investigation into a core IB Chemistry topic, transition metal complexes, with a focused research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii... affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting...?\" The background effectively uses principles like d-orbital splitting and ligand exchange to justify the methodology.\n\nHowever, Essay B showcases a superior level of exploration and personal engagement in the development of its methodology. The student identifies a practical challenge\u2014analyzing a colorless substance (Vitamin B6) via spectrophotometry\u2014and researches a sophisticated solution involving complexation with copper(II) ions and micelle formation to prevent precipitation. The dedicated \"Development and pilot studies\" section is a key strength, as it documents a genuine scientific process of identifying problems (insoluble tablet binders, precipitate formation) and iteratively refining the procedure, even citing literature to justify choices like the concentration of copper(II) sulfate. This proactive problem-solving and methodological design process is a hallmark of outstanding exploration. While Essay A is very competent, Essay B's documented journey of overcoming experimental hurdles demonstrates a more authentic and in-depth investigative process. Furthermore, Essay B's controlled variables and safety considerations are slightly more detailed and specific.",
