  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay B is significantly better than Essay A. Essay B presents a sophisticated and well-integrated investigation that excels in all areas of Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and quantitative. The background information is outstanding, weaving together complex concepts like chemical equilibrium, Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Beer-Lambert's law to provide a robust theoretical foundation. The methodology is exceptionally rigorous, featuring a two-part structure (calibration curve and main experiment), excellent and well-justified controlled variables, and the thoughtful inclusion of preliminary experiments to refine the procedure. Furthermore, Essay B includes a detailed and appropriate section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, addressing specific chemical hazards and disposal protocols.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A, while having a clear research question and a decent background explanation of freezing point depression, contains critical flaws that undermine its scientific merit. The most significant weakness is the methodological choice to use equal *mass* (5 grams) of each salt rather than an equal *number of moles*. This invalidates the core of the investigation, as the hypothesis is based on comparing the effect of the number of ions (Van't Hoff factor `i`), which is a molar property. The procedure also suggests running the trials sequentially rather than concurrently, which fails to properly control for ambient temperature changes over time. Finally, Essay A completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for this criterion. While Essay A's topic is accessible, its execution is flawed, whereas Essay B demonstrates a high level of chemical understanding and meticulous experimental planning.",
