  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more comprehensive and meticulously planned investigation, making it superior in Criterion B. Its methodology is exceptionally detailed, including specific masses with uncertainties (e.g., \"5.6 (\u00b10.01) g of pure KOH\"), concentrations, and step-by-step instructions for standardizing the titrants, which demonstrates a high level of scientific rigor. Furthermore, the \"Justification for methodology\" section thoughtfully explains the rationale behind the chosen temperature range, chemical concentrations, and sample sizes, showcasing deep understanding and personal engagement. Essay A's treatment of variables is exemplary, with a clear table outlining not just how but *why* each variable is controlled. Most significantly, its risk assessment is far more thorough than Essay B's, providing a detailed table of specific safety hazards and also addressing both ethical and environmental considerations, which are entirely absent in Essay B.\n\nWhile Essay B has a well-formulated research question and a solid background explaining the \"diverse ion effect,\" it falls short in procedural detail and safety considerations. The methodology in Essay B is conceptually sound, logically separating calibration from the main experiment, but it lacks the clarity and completeness of Essay A; for instance, it references masses needed for solutions but does not provide them. Its safety section is minimal, stating chemicals are \"non-toxic\" but could cause irritation, and it completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental impacts. This oversight is a significant weakness. Therefore, Essay A's superior detail, justification, and comprehensive handling of all aspects of the experimental design make it the stronger piece.",
