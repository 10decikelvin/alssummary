  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and detailed plans for their investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior level of planning and attention to detail, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is focused and clearly defines the independent (voltage) and dependent (percentage mass increase) variables. The background information is thorough, effectively explaining the principles of electroplating and directly linking them to Faraday's law to build a strong theoretical foundation for the hypothesis. The methodology is a key strength; it is meticulously detailed, replicable, and shows a clear understanding of how to control variables. For example, the student specifies not just *what* variables to control (surface area, concentration, distance), but precisely *how* they will be controlled (\"the copper strips for all trials will be 1cm by 10cm,\" \"the cathode will be attached to wooden splint that is marked...to ensure the same distance\"). The inclusion of an uncertainty table for measurements further highlights a high level of procedural thought.\n\nEssay B also presents a very good investigation. The research question is appropriate, and the background information correctly links reaction kinetics, acid strength (pKa), and the Arrhenius equation to formulate a testable hypothesis. However, its methodology, while detailed, reveals some potential weaknesses. For instance, the plan to use 50ml burettes to measure 2ml volumes is a significant source of uncertainty, a point the student themselves raises in their evaluation. Furthermore, while the plan involves heating and cooling reagents, it lacks a clear description of how the temperature will be maintained during the actual reaction, which is critical for kinetic studies.\n\nIn conclusion, while both students show a strong grasp of the scientific method, Essay A's experimental design is more robust, demonstrating more careful consideration of variable control and precision. The clarity and thoroughness of the procedure in Essay A make it a superior example of planning and execution.",
