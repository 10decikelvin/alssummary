  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much deeper and more sophisticated understanding of the scientific process required for an IB Chemistry IA. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, probes a relationship between two continuous variables, and is appropriate for the level. The background information is excellent; it not only introduces the relevant chemical equations but also derives the integrated rate law that forms the mathematical basis for the entire experiment, showing a high level of engagement with the theory. The variables are correctly identified and the choices for control variables are well-justified and demonstrate a strong awareness of potential sources of error. The methodology, while having minor ambiguities, is scientifically sound for investigating reaction kinetics.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, displays several significant weaknesses. The research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources... as determined by two different methodologies...?\", is convoluted and lacks focus, attempting to compare both sources and methods simultaneously. The background is largely narrative and lacks the theoretical depth seen in Essay A. Most critically, Essay B fundamentally misidentifies its variables, listing \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable when the true independent variables are the source material and the methodology. This indicates a weak grasp of experimental design. Furthermore, the methodology contains significant procedural flaws, such as using a measuring cylinder for a precise aliquot and employing a Bunsen burner for a thermal decomposition that requires a specific, controlled temperature, as the author themselves notes in the evaluation. While Essay B has a more detailed safety section, this does not compensate for the fundamental weaknesses in its scientific design and theoretical underpinning. Essay A's exploration is a well-conceived and theoretically-grounded scientific investigation, whereas Essay B's is a comparative exercise with a flawed design.",
