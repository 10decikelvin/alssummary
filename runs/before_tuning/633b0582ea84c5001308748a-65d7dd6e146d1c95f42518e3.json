The analysis provided effectively analyzes both text samples. It points out specific problems in both texts, but is still able to come to a reasonable conclusion about which is better overall. While the explanations for the relative strengths and weaknesses of each essay are clear, there isn's as much explanation as there could be on why certain criteria make a better response than others.",
