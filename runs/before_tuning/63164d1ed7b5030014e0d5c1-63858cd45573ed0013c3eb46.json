  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and viable investigations. Essay A provides a clear and replicable method for a classic experiment on vitamin C titration, with a focused research question and relevant background information. Its methodology is logical, and the identified variables are appropriate for the investigation.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of sophistication and thoroughness in its exploration. The \"Design\" section is a significant strength, where the student explicitly justifies their methodological choices, such as measuring time for a fixed volume and using six data points \"to develop a stronger correlation.\" The treatment of controlled variables is exceptionally detailed and insightful, particularly in addressing the challenge of controlling the \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" by standardizing the grinding process, a critical factor in heterogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are far more comprehensive; it references a specific safety source (CLEAPPS), differentiates hazards by chemical concentration, and thoughtfully discusses waste minimization and disposal in the context of Green Chemistry principles. In contrast, Essay A's environmental consideration is dismissive (\"No significant environmental concerns\"). While Essay A is competent, Essay B showcases deeper critical thinking, more meticulous planning, and a more profound engagement with the scientific process, making it the superior example for Criterion B.",
