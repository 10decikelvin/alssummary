  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially stronger than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is clear, focused, and grounded in a compelling real-world context of fuel efficiency and environmental impact. The background information is detailed, demonstrating a strong understanding of thermochemistry, including balanced equations and the relationship between carbon chain length and enthalpy of combustion. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to investigate two independent variables, which immediately weakens its focus. Furthermore, its background section is superficial, lacking depth on the core principles governing solubility like lattice and hydration enthalpies.\n\nThe methodology is a key differentiator. Essay B provides a detailed, replicable procedure for calorimetry, complete with a precise serial dilution table for preparing the fuel mixtures. Its section on variables is exemplary, presenting controlled variables in a well-organized table that justifies why each is controlled and explains how it will be controlled. Essay A's methodology, however, contains a critical flaw: it fails to specify the volume of water used to dissolve the salts, making the procedure impossible to replicate and invalidating any solubility calculations. Essay A also demonstrates significant confusion in identifying its variables, incorrectly listing temperature as both an independent and dependent variable.\n\nFinally, Essay B's risk assessment is comprehensive, specifically addressing safety (use of a fume cupboard for combustion), environmental (proper disposal of fuel waste), and ethical considerations. Essay A's safety precautions are generic and omit any mention of environmental impact. Overall, Essay B presents a well-planned, scientifically sound, and thoroughly considered investigation, whereas Essay A suffers from a lack of focus, critical procedural omissions, and a weak theoretical foundation.",
