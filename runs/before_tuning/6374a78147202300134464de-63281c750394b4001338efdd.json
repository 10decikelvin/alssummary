  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is as follows: Essay B presents a more coherent and scientifically sound exploration (Criterion B) than Essay A. Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is clear, focused, and directly investigated by the proposed methodology. The background information provides a solid theoretical basis, including a molecular-level explanation for the expected change in specific heat capacity and cleverly uses an analogous graph for NaCl solution to support its hypothesis. In contrast, Essay A contains a critical conceptual flaw that undermines its entire experimental design. The student states, \"I used Zinc as the limiting reactant,\" but a simple stoichiometric calculation based on their stated quantities (6g Zn and 25 cm\u00b3 of 0.5M/1.0M CuSO\u2084) reveals that copper (II) sulphate is the limiting reactant in both trials, and zinc is in massive excess. This fundamental misunderstanding invalidates the rationale for the experiment. While Essay A's background does include some high-level concepts like Gibbs free energy, this does not compensate for the flawed experimental premise. Essay B's methodology is logical, the variables are appropriately identified and controlled, and the overall exploration is well-structured and demonstrates a clear understanding of the scientific principles involved. Therefore, due to its clarity, scientific accuracy, and logical consistency, Essay B is the superior submission for Criterion B.",
