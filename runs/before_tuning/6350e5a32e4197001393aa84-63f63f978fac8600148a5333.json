  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor, focus, and chemical understanding required for Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels...\", is exceptionally focused and well-defined, clearly outlining the scope and method of quantification. In contrast, Essay A's research question is convoluted, attempting to simultaneously investigate the effect of salinity, compare different water sources, and implicitly compare two analytical methods, which significantly weakens the focus of the investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information provides a deep and relevant chemical context, thoroughly explaining the mechanisms of biosorption, including chelation and ion exchange, and uses Le Chatelier's Principle to logically explain how pH influences the protonation of functional groups on the orange peel. Essay A's background explains the Winkler method but crucially fails to provide a scientific explanation for *why* an increase in salt concentration would affect dissolved oxygen levels, which is the core concept of its investigation.\n\nThe methodology of Essay B is far more robust, demonstrating personal engagement through its detailed \"Preliminary Trials\" section, which informed the final experimental design, such as setting the pH range and contact time. Essay A's methodology is less clear, particularly in how the two measurement techniques (probe and Winkler) are being compared or used, and the use of \"different water sources\" is a major design flaw that introduces numerous uncontrolled variables. Finally, Essay B's identification and justification of controlled variables are more comprehensive and chemically sound than those in Essay A. While Essay A presents a viable, syllabus-related topic, Essay B's execution in planning and contextualizing the investigation is exemplary and far superior.",
