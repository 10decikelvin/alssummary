  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for the Exploration criterion. However, Essay B is superior due to its more robust experimental design and a more insightful and detailed justification of its methodology.\n\nEssay A presents a clear research question and a thorough background section, delving into the complex chemistry of milk composition. Its table of controlled variables is particularly commendable, as it not only identifies the variables but also explains why and how they will be controlled. However, a significant weakness is its reliance on manufacturer's nutritional labels for the independent variables (protein and fat content). This introduces a major source of uncertainty and means the student is not directly manipulating or measuring this key variable, making the investigation more of a verification exercise than a true experiment.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, exhibits a more sophisticated approach to experimental design. The research question is sharply focused, and the student demonstrates excellent foresight by calculating and justifying the concentration of the titrant to be used. The methodology is designed so that the student has direct control over the independent variable (pH), which is a hallmark of a stronger investigation. Furthermore, the \"Weaknesses\" section in Essay B is exceptionally detailed and reflective, offering specific, practical improvements like using a colorimeter for the endpoint and standardizing the KMnO\u2084 solution, which shows a deeper understanding of experimental limitations. While Essay A is well-structured, Essay B's superior control of variables and more critical self-evaluation make it the stronger piece of work.",
