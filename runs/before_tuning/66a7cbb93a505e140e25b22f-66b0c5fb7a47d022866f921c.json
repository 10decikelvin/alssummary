  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and scientifically rigorous exploration. Its research question is sophisticated, and the background information provides excellent context, linking thermochemical principles to a relevant real-world issue of fuel efficiency and environmental impact. The methodology in Essay B is exemplary; it is highly detailed, includes a clear serial dilution table, justifies the choice of apparatus, and presents the controlled variables in a well-structured table explaining not only *what* will be controlled, but *why* and *how*. This level of detail and justification is far superior to Essay A. For example, Essay B's justification for its chosen concentrations is \"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia, it is logical to start with it...\". Furthermore, Essay B's student shows mature scientific thinking by acknowledging the inherent systematic errors in calorimetry but correctly reasoning that \"the trend itself does not alter,\" which strengthens the validity of their experimental design.\n\nEssay A presents a solid, classic experiment, but it lacks the depth of Essay B. The research question is clear and focused, and the background is adequate. However, the methodology is less detailed, and the treatment of variables is a notable weakness. The student's justification for not controlling the mass of the antacid tablets (\"to give a realistic answer, the mass of each tablet will be kept as is\") introduces a confounding variable, making a direct comparison of the active ingredients' effectiveness difficult. While the real-world justification has some merit, a more rigorous approach would involve measuring the mass and calculating effectiveness per gram. In contrast, Essay B's meticulous control over variables, such as using the same source for chemicals and setting the room temperature, reflects a much stronger experimental design. The safety and environmental considerations in both are appropriate, but Essay B's are more specific, mentioning the critical use of a \"ventilated fume cupboard\" for combustion.",
