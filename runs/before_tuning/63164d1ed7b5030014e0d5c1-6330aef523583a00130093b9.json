  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior because it demonstrates a much stronger grasp of practical experimental design, which is central to Criterion B. The most significant flaw in Essay B is the incorrect identification of its variables; it explicitly confuses the independent variable (\"Different types of substances...\") with the dependent variable (\"Temperature change...\"). In contrast, Essay A correctly identifies the independent variable (time in water bath), dependent variable (Vitamin C content), and provides a comprehensive, well-justified list of controlled variables, such as \"Type and brand of bell pepper\" and \"Temperature Of Water Bath\". While Essay B's theoretical background on thermochemistry is more complex and ambitious, its proposed methodology is critically flawed, using concentrations that were too low to produce a measurable temperature change in a simple calorimeter\u2014a major oversight in the planning stage. Essay A\u2019s methodology is clear, detailed, and highly appropriate for its focused research question, making it easily replicable and far more likely to yield valid data. Finally, Essay A presents a well-reasoned hypothesis connecting heat exposure to vitamin C degradation, whereas Essay B's hypothesis is a simple restatement of its research question.",
