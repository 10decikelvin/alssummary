  "reasoning": "Both students provided high quality responses focusing clearly on the question requirements, linking both arguments directly and correctly and showing good historical knowledge. Overall though,axplanation provides a stronger case as it gives better explanation in their evaluation by referring to specific examples when discussing limitations of sources used, and does this consistently throughout the-response. Although both responses do correctly use the values provided in the- text and data to present appropriate analysis, however the discussion is far more detailed than that demonstrated in sample response. Furthermore, student A has provided a more focused and detailed discussion of evidence provided, including the reliability of the sources mentioned (sources not provided), whereas student b, though providing some critical evaluation, did not do so with the same level of depth. This suggests that student A is far more effective at using evidence and sources to develop their argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the time period making this the slightly better response.",
