  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations with clear research questions and relevant background information. Essay B tackles a more conceptually complex chemical topic, demonstrating a solid understanding of d-orbital splitting, ligand exchange, and spectroscopy. Its background section is rich with relevant chemical theory and equations. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior overall experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Essay A's methodology is exceptionally detailed and replicable, integrating technology like Tracker software and a LabQuest 2 to enhance precision. Its treatment of variables is exemplary; it not only lists controlled variables but also explains *how* they will be controlled and the *potential impact* if they are not, and critically, it also identifies and discusses uncontrolled variables. Furthermore, Essay A's risk assessment is more comprehensive, including not just safety but also thoughtful environmental and ethical considerations regarding the use of food-grade materials. In contrast, while Essay B's plan is sound, its methodology overlooks key chemical realities (e.g., the oxidation of Fe\u00b2\u207a/Mn\u00b2\u207a and the non-octahedral geometry of the copper complex), which are identified as significant flaws later in its evaluation, suggesting a weakness in the initial planning stage. Therefore, for its more rigorous and meticulously planned experimental design, Essay A is the better example of Criterion B.",
