  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-formulated: it is focused, specific, and clearly defines the scope of the investigation into reaction kinetics, including the specific reactants, conditions, and analytical method. The background section provides a robust rationale by connecting the research to real-world pollution issues and clearly identifying a research gap in the existing literature, which elevates the project's academic context. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is exemplary, featuring a detailed table of controlled variables with clear justifications and methods for control, and it explicitly discusses how preliminary trials were used to refine crucial parameters like concentration and sampling frequency.\n\nWhile Essay B is also a strong submission, its research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...?\" frames the investigation as a methodological validation rather than a scientific exploration of a phenomenon. This inherently limits its scope under the 'Exploration' criterion. Although Essay B provides a thorough background on the Winkler method and has excellent safety and environmental considerations, Essay A's project feels more like a genuine scientific inquiry. The seamless integration of background literature (like the \"scavenging effect\") directly into the design of the independent variable's range in Essay A showcases a higher level of critical thinking and scientific engagement. Therefore, Essay A's superior research question and more sophisticated experimental design make it the better of the two.",
