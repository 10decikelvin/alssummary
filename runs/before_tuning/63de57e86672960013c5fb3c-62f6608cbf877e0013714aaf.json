  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a more comprehensive and well-rounded approach to Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and personally motivated by a genuine interest in jewellery making, providing excellent context. The background information thoroughly covers the principles of electrolysis and cites previous studies, which informs the experimental design. A major strength of Essay A is its detailed and justified treatment of controlled variables, explaining not only *what* will be controlled (surface area, concentration, distance) but also *why* it is important and *how* it will be achieved. Furthermore, its risk assessment is exemplary, offering specific, thoughtful considerations for safety (handling H\u2082SO\u2084) and environmental disposal (neutralizing acid, alternative uses for CuSO\u2084).\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating a strong theoretical understanding by deriving the integrated rate law, is weaker in several key areas of exploration. The personal engagement is minimal, reading more like a standard textbook introduction. The methodology, specifically the description of the back-titration, is confusing and potentially flawed (\"the solution was titrated with NaOH\" when trying to determine the amount of unreacted NaOH). While some controlled variables are listed, others are more about general lab technique (\"Swirling conical flask\") rather than specific parameters affecting the reaction rate. Finally, the safety and environmental considerations are superficial; for instance, suggesting flushing ethyl acetate \"down the sink with large quantities of water\" is a simplistic and potentially inadequate disposal method compared to the nuanced approach in Essay A.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a more thoughtfully designed and thoroughly justified investigation from start to finish, making it the superior example for Criterion B.",
