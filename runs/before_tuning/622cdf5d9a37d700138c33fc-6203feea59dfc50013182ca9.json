  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor and depth. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined, and its background information is outstanding, not only explaining the Maillard reaction but also adeptly connecting it to the principles of colorimetry and the Lambert-Beer Law, justifying the specific wavelength chosen. The student in Essay A also shows a sophisticated understanding of the scientific context by identifying a specific gap in existing literature\u2014the use of real foods versus model foods\u2014which provides a compelling rationale for the investigation. In contrast, while Essay B's rationale is valid and shows good personal engagement with a local environmental issue, it lacks the same level of academic depth.\n\nThe primary difference lies in the methodology and control of variables. Essay A's procedure is meticulously detailed with precise measurements (e.g., \"50.535g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084,\" \"baked for 17 minutes in an oven preheated at 200\u00b0C\"), making it highly replicable. Its table of controlled variables is comprehensive and explains not just *how* each variable is controlled, but *why* it matters. Essay B's methodology, while logical, relies on less precise techniques, such as using \"6 drops of HCl\" to alter pH and controlling temperature by placing samples in a \"dark cupboard,\" which is less rigorous than Essay A's use of a preheated oven. Although Essay B features a more thorough and well-structured risk assessment, Essay A's superior experimental design, precision, and deeper scientific justification make it the stronger piece of work overall for Criterion B.",
