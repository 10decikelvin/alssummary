  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and well-developed exploration of its research topic. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is highly specific and focused. The background information comprehensively covers the necessary theory, defining key concepts like bioplastics, plasticizers, and Young's Modulus, even providing the required formulas. Most impressively, Essay B presents an exceptionally detailed methodology and an exhaustive treatment of variables, including separate tables for controlled and uncontrolled variables that explain not just *what* will be controlled, but *how* and *why*. Furthermore, it includes a robust risk assessment that thoughtfully addresses safety, environmental, and ethical considerations.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a viable topic with a clear research question: \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\". The background provides a good chemical foundation for the titration method and uses relevant theory like the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to support its hypothesis. However, it falls short in several key areas of the Exploration criterion. The methodology is only described conceptually; it explains the chemistry of the titration but does not provide a step-by-step procedure for conducting the experiment. Crucially, it completely fails to list controlled variables or address any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which are essential components of this criterion. While Essay A has a good starting point, Essay B's meticulous planning, detailed methodology, and comprehensive consideration of all experimental aspects make it the clear superior.",
