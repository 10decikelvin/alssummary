  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B across all aspects. Its research question, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at... affect its calcium content... by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is highly focused, specific, and incorporates a sophisticated analytical technique appropriate for the IB Chemistry level. The background information provides a detailed and relevant explanation of complexometric titrations, the chemistry of EDTA, and the effect of heat on calcium solubility in milk, creating a strong theoretical foundation for the experiment. Furthermore, Essay B excels in its methodology, justifying the choice of titration over other methods and providing a meticulous list of controlled variables with clear justifications and control methods. The safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are exemplary, identifying specific chemical hazards (ammonia) and outlining precise mitigation strategies (use of a fume cupboard).\n\nIn contrast, Essay A, while based on a sound scientific principle (freezing point depression), contains a critical flaw in its experimental design. The background correctly identifies that the number of ions (the van't Hoff factor) is the key determinant of a salt's effectiveness. However, the methodology states, \"Measure only 5 grams of each salt,\" failing to account for the different molar masses of NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2. This means the experiment does not control for the number of moles of salt or, more importantly, the moles of ions, which fundamentally undermines the investigation's ability to answer its own research question accurately. Additionally, Essay A completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for this criterion. While Essay A's topic is accessible, its execution is far less rigorous and scientifically sound than Essay B's.",
