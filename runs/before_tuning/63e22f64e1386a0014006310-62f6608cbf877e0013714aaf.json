  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and appropriate investigations for the IB Chemistry level. Essay A's two-part research question is clear and its methodology is logical. Its presentation is a key strength, particularly the table for controlled variables which clearly explains the reason for controlling each factor and the method used to do so. The safety considerations are also laid out in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand table format.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific exploration and personal engagement. The background section is exemplary; it does not merely define terms but derives the second-order integrated rate law (\"`\\frac{1}{c}-\\frac{1}{c_{0}}=k t`\") from first principles and explicitly links the experimental goal to the Arrhenius equation. This shows a deep theoretical understanding that directly informs the experimental design and data analysis plan. The methodology itself, involving quenching the reaction and performing titrations at timed intervals, is more complex and technically demanding than the simple calorimetry in Essay A. Essay B\u2019s justification for choosing its temperature intervals (\"large enough to give us a noticeable change in the rate constants\") also shows thoughtful planning. While Essay A's exploration is competent and thorough, Essay B's investigation is built on a more sophisticated theoretical foundation that is explained with impressive clarity and mathematical rigor, making it the superior example of Criterion B.",
