  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused, specific, and appropriately complex for the IB level, clearly outlining the scope, variables, and analytical technique. The background information is comprehensive, well-researched with citations, and directly relevant, discussing not only the basic reaction but also advanced concepts like the Photo-Fenton process, rate mechanisms, and the \"scavenging effect\" which directly informs and justifies the experimental design. The methodology is meticulous, repeatable, and its development is justified through detailed preliminary trials. Furthermore, the identification and control of variables are excellent, with clear scientific reasoning for why each must be controlled and how this will be achieved.\n\nEssay B, while competent, is less sophisticated. Its research question is simpler and less ambitious, focusing on \"reaction rate\" rather than determining the order of reaction, which is a more advanced kinetic analysis. The background information is more general, relying on textbook-level explanations of kinetics and collision theory, and the rationale is based on personal anecdote rather than a clear scientific context or gap in the literature. While the methodology includes a commendable preliminary titration to determine the bleach concentration, the main procedure lacks precision, particularly in the preparation of diluted solutions (\"dilute 9 cm\u00b3 of commercial bleach with 3 cm\u00b3 of distilled H\u2082O\" is less accurate than using volumetric flasks). The control of variables is also weaker, with less specific justification and vague methods of control (e.g., conducting the experiment in a room with \"almost the same\" temperature).\n\nOverall, Essay A displays a much deeper personal engagement with the scientific process, using literature to design a robust and nuanced experiment. Essay B presents a more standard, procedural investigation with less depth in both its research and experimental design.",
