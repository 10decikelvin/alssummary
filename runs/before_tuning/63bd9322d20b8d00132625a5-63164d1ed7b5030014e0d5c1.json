  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a good understanding of the IA requirements, presenting a clear research question, methodology, and analysis. However, Essay B edges out as slightly superior due to its more thorough and considered approach, particularly in its contextualization and procedural detail.\n\nEssay A presents a clear research question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion?\". The methodology is straightforward, but the results section highlights a significant flaw: \"The experimental values of the enthalpy of combustion showed an R^2 value of 0.8033, which indicates a good linear correlation, however, the slope of the line of best fit for my experimental values shows a slightly positive correlation... This contradicts the scientific principles as the enthalpy of combustion should become more negative as the carbon content of a substance increases\". The student recognizes this discrepancy and attributes it to \"several errors and limitations\". While acknowledging errors is good, the magnitude of the discrepancy suggests a potential fundamental flaw in the experimental design or execution that isn't fully addressed in the evaluation. The proposed improvements are standard but don't deeply reflect on why the experiment failed so drastically.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, presents a more robust investigation into \"what extent... the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath\". The introduction provides excellent context and personal engagement. The method is detailed and easy to follow. Crucially, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying chemistry (Redox titration) and correctly predicts the expected outcome. The results align well with the hypothesis, showing a clear negative correlation. The discussion of limitations and extensions is also more insightful than in Essay A. For example, suggesting a smaller range for the independent variable to better understand the initial steep drop shows a deeper level of critical reflection. The inclusion of potential future investigations into other cooking methods or antioxidant components also adds strength to the report.\n\nIn conclusion, while both are decent attempts, Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and successful scientific investigation from conception to conclusion, with a clearer link between theory, method, and results.",
