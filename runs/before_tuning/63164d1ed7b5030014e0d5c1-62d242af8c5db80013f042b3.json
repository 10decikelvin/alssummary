  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more coherent and scientifically sound investigation, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. The research question is clear, focused, and directly addressed by a well-explained and appropriate methodology (redox titration with iodine). The background information correctly details the chemistry of ascorbic acid and its reaction with iodine, including a balanced chemical equation, demonstrating a solid understanding of the principles involved. The variables are logically identified and justified, and the procedure is straightforward and replicable.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay B is more detailed in its presentation, particularly in its tables for variables and limitations, it suffers from a significant lack of clarity and potential inaccuracies in its understanding of the core chemistry. The explanation of the complexometric back-titration is convoluted and appears to confuse several key concepts, which undermines the entire experimental design. The research question is also awkwardly phrased, including the methodology within the question itself. Although Essay B's risk assessment and evaluation of limitations are more comprehensive than Essay A's, this cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in its chemical background and proposed methodology. Therefore, Essay A's clear, correct, and viable experimental plan makes it superior.",
