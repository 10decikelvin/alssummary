  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of planning, reflection, and sophistication in its experimental design, making it the superior choice for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question is ambitious yet focused, and the introduction provides excellent context by linking the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction to real-world phenomena like cardiac arrhythmia, showing strong personal engagement. The methodology section is a standout feature; the author details the process of selecting the best measurement technique, moving from visual observation to a colorimeter and finally settling on a lux sensor. This iterative process of refinement is a hallmark of excellent experimental design and exploration. Furthermore, the table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only listing the variables but also thoroughly justifying why they must be controlled and detailing the precise method of control. The safety and environmental considerations are also specific and demonstrate a mature approach, including the decision to scale down the reaction to minimize waste.\n\nEssay B presents a classic and appropriate kinetics experiment. The background information is relevant, linking the rate of reaction to the Arrhenius equation and activation energy. However, the methodology has a critical flaw: relying on the naked eye to determine the endpoint of a color change. The author acknowledges this in their evaluation (\"Relying on the naked eye may cause random errors\"), but for an investigation that requires precise rate data to construct an Arrhenius plot, this is a very significant limitation that should have been addressed with a better instrumental method from the outset. While Essay B's variable control and safety sections are adequate, they lack the depth and detailed justification seen in Essay A.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A is stronger because its methodology is more robust, demonstrates thoughtful preliminary work and problem-solving, and is supported by a more thorough and well-justified plan for controlling variables.",
