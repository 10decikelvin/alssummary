  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its exceptional depth of research, sophisticated experimental design, and stronger scientific context.\n\nEssay A provides a well-structured and competent exploration. The research question is clear and focused, the background connects the topic to real-world environmental concerns, and the controlled variables are exceptionally well-detailed in a clear table explaining the 'why' and 'how'. The methodology is appropriate, though the presentation of the dilution calculation is somewhat confusing. The safety and environmental considerations are also well-handled. Overall, it's a very solid and well-executed plan for a standard calorimetry experiment.\n\nEssay B, however, demonstrates a much higher level of scientific engagement and inquiry. The background information is outstanding, citing literature to explain complex mechanisms like the Photo-Fenton reaction and the \"scavenging effect\" of excess H\u2082O\u2082. This level of research allows the student to identify a genuine research gap and design an experiment to address it, which is a hallmark of a top-tier IA. The methodology is refined through described \"Preliminary Trials,\" a sophisticated practice showing an iterative and thoughtful approach to experimental design. Like Essay A, its controlled variables section is excellent. While its research question is verbose, the underlying scientific thought, from justifying the concentration range to acknowledging the Beer-Lambert Law, is more advanced and thorough than in Essay A.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay A presents a very good plan, Essay B's plan is exceptional. It is built upon a foundation of deep research, demonstrates a more complex understanding of the underlying chemistry, and shows a more mature approach to designing a robust scientific investigation.",
