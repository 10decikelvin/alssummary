  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay A demonstrates a superior level of exploration through its experimental design and justification. Essay A's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is exceptionally well-focused, clearly defining the independent and dependent variables as well as the specific analytical technique. Its methodology is detailed and sophisticated, including thoughtful steps like creating a calibration curve and using a centrifuge to remove precipitate, which shows a deep understanding of potential procedural issues. The highlight of Essay A is its treatment of controlled variables, presented in a clear table that not only identifies them but rigorously justifies *why* and *how* each is controlled, which is exemplary.\n\nEssay B is a high-quality database investigation with two clear research questions about the properties of alcohols as fuels. Its background provides a strong environmental context and personal engagement. The methodology is appropriate for a database study, identifying reliable sources and outlining data processing steps. However, having two research questions slightly dilutes its focus compared to Essay A's single, targeted investigation. While the controlled variable (using only linear primary alcohols) is well-chosen, the depth of procedural planning and justification demonstrated in Essay A's hands-on experimental design is more comprehensive and showcases a higher level of scientific exploration. Therefore, Essay A is the better of the two for Criterion B.",
