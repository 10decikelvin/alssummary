  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially stronger and demonstrates a much higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, appropriate for the IB level, and investigates a relationship between variables, which is more sophisticated than a simple comparison. The background information is excellent; it correctly outlines the Arrhenius equation and derives the second-order integrated rate law, providing a robust theoretical framework that directly justifies the experimental design and data analysis. The methodology, involving quenching the reaction at timed intervals and using back-titration, is complex but scientifically sound and appropriate for answering the research question. Safety precautions are specific and relevant, identifying the flammability of ethyl acetate and corrosiveness of NaOH, unlike the dismissive and unsafe advice in Essay A.\n\nConversely, Essay A is built upon a fundamental scientific flaw. While its personal engagement is clear, the research question aims to measure ascorbic acid concentration using an acid-base titration with NaOH. As the student correctly identifies (but only in the limitations section), this method is invalid because NaOH will neutralize all acids present in orange juice (e.g., citric acid, malic acid), not just ascorbic acid. This means the entire methodology is inappropriate for answering the stated research question, rendering the collected data useless for the intended purpose. Furthermore, the safety section in Essay A is weak, incorrectly stating that gloves are not necessary for handling 0.05M NaOH. While Essay A has a well-structured variables table, this does not compensate for the critical error in its experimental design. Essay B's investigation is a well-conceived and executed exploration of chemical kinetics, whereas Essay A's is based on a flawed premise from the outset.",
