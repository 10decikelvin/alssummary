  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A and demonstrates a much higher level of achievement for Criterion B.\n\nThe research question in Essay B is highly focused, specific, and clearly grounded in scientific literature: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2 in the degradation of Methyl Orange...\". This contrasts with Essay A's RQ which, while functional, is a bit convoluted and contains a notable inconsistency between the temperatures listed in the question (20, 40, 60, 80, 100\u00b0C) and those in the variables table (20, 35, 50, 65, 80\u00b0C).\n\nEssay B's background information is exceptional. It provides a robust, well-cited context, explaining the environmental relevance of azo dyes, the detailed chemistry of the Photo-Fenton reaction, the theoretical rate mechanism, and even advanced concepts like the \"Scavenging Effect\". This depth directly informs and justifies the entire experimental design. Essay A's background is adequate in explaining the basics of EDTA titration but lacks the same level of scientific depth and clarity, particularly in its confusing description of the back-titration process.\n\nMethodologically, Essay B is far superior. It includes a section on preliminary trials, which demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to developing a viable procedure. The justification for the chosen concentration range of H\u2082O\u2082 is excellent, showing a proactive effort to avoid known experimental complications. In contrast, Essay A's methodology has a critical omission: it fails to describe how the milk sample will be prepared for titration. Milk's proteins and fats would significantly interfere with the EDTA titration endpoint, and a precipitation/filtration step is essential. Essay A also has a far more extensive list of controlled variables, but many of them are trivial (e.g., volume of the sample), while Essay B focuses on the most scientifically significant factors and provides stronger justifications.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide good safety information and lists of limitations, Essay B's evaluation is more insightful. It discusses sophisticated issues such as the decomposition of H\u2082O\u2082, the effect of changing liquid depth on light absorption, and instrumental limitations like stray light and Schott noise. Essay A's limitations are more generic (e.g., parallax error, room temperature), although the point about the milk's colour interfering with the indicator is a good one. Overall, Essay B presents a thoroughly researched, well-designed, and scientifically sophisticated exploration.",
