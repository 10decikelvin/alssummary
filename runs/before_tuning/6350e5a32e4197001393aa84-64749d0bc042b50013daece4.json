Essay A's methodology contains a significant conceptual flaw, suggesting the use of an oxygen probe *after* the titration has already occurred, which demonstrates a misunderstanding of the process. Finally, Essay B's treatment of variables, particularly its extensive and well-justified list of controlled variables (e.g., exposure to air, atmospheric pressure), is exemplary and vastly superior to the more basic list provided in Essay A.",
