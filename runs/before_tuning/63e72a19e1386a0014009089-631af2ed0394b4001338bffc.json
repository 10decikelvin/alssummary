  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong methodologies, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and critical thinking. Essay A provides a solid, well-structured investigation into a classic topic, with a clear research question, logical procedure, and good control of variables. However, its background information is more of a textbook summary. In contrast, Essay B's research question is more original and ambitious, exploring the relationship between multiple variables across different types of milk. Its background section is exceptionally strong, citing multiple sources and establishing a clear rationale based on conflicting findings in scientific literature. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is more sophisticated, including the preparation of a buffer solution to precisely control pH. Critically, Essay B also includes a section on uncontrolled variables, which shows a deeper reflection on the experimental limitations. Finally, Essay B's consideration of safety, environmental, and ethical aspects is more comprehensive than Essay A's.",
