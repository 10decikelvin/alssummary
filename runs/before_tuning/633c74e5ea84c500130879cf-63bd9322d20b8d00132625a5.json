  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a solid understanding of experimental design, but Essay A is slightly stronger overall. Essay A presents a clearer and more focused research question: \"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\". This contrasts with Essay B's question, \"What is the effect of different masses of stearin added to paraffin wax candles on its enthalpy of combustion of the candles?\", which is less clear as 'masses' appears to be a misnomer for 'concentration'. Essay A provides a more thorough background, citing specific chemical concepts that underpin the investigation, whereas Essay B's background is somewhat brief. Both submissions effectively identify and categorize their variables and provide clear, detailed methodologies. However, Essay A's inclusion of an initial, less successful experimental approach demonstrates a more robust iterative process, which is a key aspect of scientific inquiry. While both acknowledge limitations, Essay A's suggestions for improvement are more detailed and directly tied to the specific errors encountered. Essay B's suggestions are somewhat generic. The quality of data presentation in Essay B, including tables and graphs, is good, but Essay A's structured approach to variables and procedure is slightly more meticulous. Therefore, despite both being competent pieces of work, Essay A exhibits a higher level of scientific rigor and detailed planning.",
