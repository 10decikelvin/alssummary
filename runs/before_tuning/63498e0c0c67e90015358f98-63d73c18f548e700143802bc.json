  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of planning and understanding for Criterion B. Its background section is exceptionally thorough, delving into the specifics of the carbonate-bicarbonate buffer system, correctly identifying the reacting species, and explaining the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and buffer capacity with multiple formulas. The \"Development of Methodology\" section is a standout feature, as it explicitly details how the procedure was adapted from a university-level experiment, justifying the choice of variables and demonstrating a high degree of student engagement. Furthermore, Essay B's risk assessment is presented in a detailed table that comprehensively covers safety, environmental, and ethical aspects, which is far more robust than Essay A's brief paragraph.\n\nEssay A has a strong foundation with a clear research question and a good personal context connecting the chemistry to fertilizers. The background on the \"salting in\" effect is relevant and appropriate. However, the methodology contains significant ambiguities and potential flaws. The procedure for making solutions is incomplete, with missing values for masses and dilutions. More critically, the choice of 210 nm for spectrophotometry is questionable as many species, including chloride ions, absorb in the far-UV range, which could cause major interference. There is also confusion regarding the calibration curve, as it is unclear if the calibration standards contained only CaSO\u2084 or also MgCl\u2082, which would significantly impact the validity of the molar absorptivity constant. In contrast, the methodological weaknesses in Essay B (e.g., manual stirring) are minor compared to the more fundamental issues in Essay A's experimental design. Therefore, Essay B presents a more scientifically sound, detailed, and well-justified exploration.",
