  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exceptionally focused and clearly defines all key parameters. Its background research is not only scientifically sound but also cites multiple previous studies, which informs and justifies the experimental design. The methodology is meticulous, replicable, and includes specific details on controlling variables, such as using a marked wooden splint to maintain the distance between electrodes. Furthermore, the safety, ethical, and environmental section is outstandingly thorough, addressing specific chemical hazards and providing detailed protocols for waste disposal, such as neutralizing acid and managing copper sulphate waste.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a solid investigation with good personal context and relevant background chemistry on vitamin C and titration, it contains several notable weaknesses. Its research question attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously (temperature and juice type), which dilutes the focus of the experiment. The most significant flaw lies in the methodology: the juice is heated to the target temperature and *then* removed from the heat source for titration, meaning the temperature is not actually controlled during the measurement process, which fundamentally undermines the investigation. Additionally, while Essay B considers safety and ethics, its environmental considerations are superficial, failing to address the disposal of chemical waste like the iodine solution. In contrast, Essay A demonstrates superior planning, a more rigorous and valid methodology, and a much deeper consideration of the full scope of a scientific investigation.",
