  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in the comprehensive and relevant background information provided. The essay clearly explains the principles of buffer solutions, defines buffer capacity with a relevant equation, and crucially, links the research question to underlying theory by discussing the temperature dependence of pKa via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. This establishes a strong scientific context for the investigation. Furthermore, Essay A excels in its explicit and detailed identification of independent, dependent, and controlled variables in clear tables, explaining how each will be managed and why it is significant.\n\nConversely, Essay B is critically lacking in these areas. It presents a research question but offers no subsequent background information to explain the principles of complexometric titration, the role of EDTA, or the scientific rationale for why milk's calcium content might change over time. This is a major omission. Essay B also fails to formally identify and describe its variables, leaving the reader to infer them from the research question, and it provides only a partial, incomplete procedure. While Essay B's risk assessment is more complete than Essay A's truncated version, this single strength does not compensate for the fundamental lack of scientific context and methodological detail. Essay A's procedure is poorly organized, which is a notable weakness, but the content required to design and understand the experiment is present, unlike in Essay B.",
