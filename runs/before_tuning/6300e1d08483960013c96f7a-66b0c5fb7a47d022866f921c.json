  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards, which assess the quality of the exploration. Essay B is demonstrably superior across nearly all aspects of this criterion.\n\nFirst, Essay B's research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is framed within a highly relevant and well-articulated real-world context of fuel efficiency and environmental impact. The background information is thorough, directly supports the investigation by explaining the thermochemistry of combustion, and clearly establishes the scientific basis for the hypothesis. In contrast, while Essay A's question is clear, its experimental design contains a significant flaw: it controls for the *mass* of the salts rather than the *moles*. This is a critical oversight because the background theory, which is otherwise well-explained, hinges on the number of ions produced (the Van't Hoff factor), which is directly related to moles, not mass.\n\nSecond, the methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed and rigorous. It includes a clear serial dilution plan, specific instructions for calorimetry, and a well-justified apparatus list. The justification for measuring energy in kJ/g instead of kJ/mol shows a sophisticated understanding of the real-world limitations of the fuel samples. Essay A's method is simpler and has potential issues, such as running trials sequentially, which could introduce uncontrolled variables like changes in ambient temperature over time.\n\nThird, the identification and control of variables in Essay B are exemplary. The controlled variables are presented in a comprehensive table with strong justifications, demonstrating a high level of foresight in the experimental design. For example, controlling for the \"Source of E10\" and \"Source of ethanol\" shows an awareness of potential impurities and variations. Essay A's controlled variables are appropriate, but the flawed control of salt mass weakens the entire design.\n\nFinally, and most decisively, Essay B includes a dedicated and appropriate \"Risk Assessment\" section that addresses safety, environmental, and ethical considerations, a mandatory component of Criterion B. Essay A completely omits this section, which is a major deficiency that significantly limits its score. Overall, Essay B presents a far more scientifically sound, thorough, and well-considered exploration.",
