  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much higher level of personal engagement, scientific inquiry, and methodological development, which are central to Criterion B. Its greatest strength lies in the \"Development and pilot studies\" section, where the student thoughtfully identifies significant practical challenges, such as the tablet's insoluble binders and the precipitate formation of the copper(II) complex. The essay then details a logical and iterative process of problem-solving, including researching micelle formation and conducting a pilot study to find a suitable, safer alternative to a literature-cited dye. In contrast, Essay A presents a well-structured and competent plan but lacks this depth of exploration; its method feels more like a standard procedure being followed rather than one being developed. Furthermore, Essay B's background section is more robust because it explicitly justifies the complex analytical choice (complexation with Cu\u00b2\u207a to create a colored compound for spectrophotometry) by linking it to underlying chemical principles like crystal field theory. Essay A's background, while relevant, fails to adequately explain why UV-Vis spectrophotometry at 210 nm is a valid method for quantifying CaSO\u2084. Finally, Essay B's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors is more detailed and specific than Essay A's more generic treatment.",
