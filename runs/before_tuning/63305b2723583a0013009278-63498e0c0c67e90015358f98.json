  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-defined and focused research questions with strong personal engagement and relevant background information. Essay A's methodology is straightforward and appropriate, demonstrating a good understanding of electrolysis. However, Essay B exhibits a more sophisticated and rigorous experimental design. The use of spectrophotometry, including the creation of a calibration curve, demonstrates a higher level of scientific methodology. Furthermore, Essay B's table of controlled variables is more detailed, explaining not just *what* was controlled, but also *how* and *why*, which indicates a deeper level of planning and foresight. While Essay A has a slightly better section on environmental considerations, Essay B's overall scientific approach\u2014from its advanced measurement technique to its thorough control of variables and data analysis plan\u2014is more impressive and demonstrates a greater depth of exploration.",
