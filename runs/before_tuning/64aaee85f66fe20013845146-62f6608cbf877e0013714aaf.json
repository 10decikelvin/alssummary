  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more sophisticated and well-developed exploration of a chemical principle, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused, analytical, and probes a fundamental relationship in chemical kinetics. The background section is exemplary; it doesn't just provide facts but derives the second-order integrated rate law and linearizes the Arrhenius equation, creating a robust theoretical framework that directly justifies the chosen methodology and data analysis. The methodology itself, involving quenching a reaction at timed intervals and performing titrations, is complex and appropriate for the question. In contrast, Essay A's research question is more descriptive (\"Investigating the caffeine content... in different brands\"), and its background provides general information on tea and caffeine without deeply exploring the chemical principles of solvent extraction. While Essay A's procedure is clear and its variables are well-controlled (the control for the evaporation rate via holes in the foil is a nice detail), the overall scientific depth and intellectual engagement are far greater in Essay B. Finally, Essay B's consideration of variables is stronger, as it explicitly links the control of initial concentrations to the assumptions made in its theoretical derivation, showcasing a cohesive and well-planned investigation.",
