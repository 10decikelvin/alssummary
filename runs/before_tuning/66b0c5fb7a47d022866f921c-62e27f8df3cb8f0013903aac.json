  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and sophisticated approach to the investigation. The research question is highly specific, detailing not just the variables but also the methodology and the final value to be calculated (activation energy). The background section in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, seamlessly integrating concepts from reaction kinetics, including the multi-step reaction mechanism, the Beer-Lambert law, the rate law, and the Arrhenius equation, showcasing a deep conceptual understanding. While Essay A has a good background, it is less theoretically dense.\n\nA key strength of Essay B is the explicit mention and use of preliminary testing to justify the chosen temperature range and refine the methodology, which is a hallmark of a well-planned and authentic scientific investigation. For example, it states, \"The reactions at 70\u00b0c were too quick to collect data... so 60\u00b0c was chosen as the extreme.\" Essay A justifies its variable range based on real-world context, which is good, but lacks this evidence of prior practical exploration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's handling of variables is meticulous. The controlled variables are not only listed but are justified with clear links to the theory, such as noting that \"Mixing the propanone and sulfuric acid with iodine will increase the frequency of collisions thus the rate of reaction.\" The safety assessment in Essay B is also significantly more comprehensive, providing a chemical-by-chemical breakdown of risks and mitigation strategies. Essay A's exploration is competent and clearly written, but it doesn't achieve the same depth, rigor, or level of scientific detail demonstrated in Essay B.",
