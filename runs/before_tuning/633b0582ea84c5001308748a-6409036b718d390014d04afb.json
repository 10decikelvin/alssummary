  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does varying temperature... affect the oscillation pattern and duration of a Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) non-linear chemical oscillator,\" is highly focused, specific, and sets up a sophisticated experimental investigation. The methodology section is exemplary, detailing the student's personal engagement and problem-solving process in selecting appropriate measurement apparatus, moving from a stopwatch to a colorimeter and finally to a data logger with a lux sensor, justifying each step. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is outstanding; it not only identifies specific chemical hazards and mitigation strategies but also thoughtfully discusses reducing the scale of the experiment to minimize environmental impact and waste.\n\nIn contrast, while Essay A presents a solid and well-structured database investigation, it lacks the depth of personal exploration evident in Essay B. The research questions are clear but fundamentally simpler, involving the retrieval and analysis of established data. Essay A\u2019s methodology is appropriate for its database approach, citing reliable sources like NIST, but it doesn't offer the opportunity to showcase the experimental design, problem-solving, and procedural refinement that makes Essay B so compelling. The environmental considerations in Essay A are integrated into the topic's background but are not a reflection of the student's own methodological choices. Therefore, Essay B's detailed, reflective, and comprehensive approach to designing a hands-on experiment makes it clearly superior.",
