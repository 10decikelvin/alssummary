  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger than Essay A in its fulfillment of Criterion B due to its superior depth, complexity, and thoroughness across all assessed components. While Essay A presents a competent and well-structured investigation, Essay B showcases a much higher level of scientific engagement and methodological rigor.\n\nEssay B's research question, \"Investigating effect of heating on oil at a range of different temperatures...by determining Acid value and saponification value,\" is more complex as it examines the effect of a continuous independent variable (temperature) on two distinct chemical properties. This contrasts with Essay A's simpler, categorical investigation of \"different brands of black tea.\" Furthermore, Essay B's background information provides a more robust scientific foundation, explaining the chemical reactions of hydrolysis and saponification, whereas Essay A's background is more descriptive.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant point of differentiation. Essay B's procedure is exceptionally detailed, including steps for standardizing reagents, a reflux setup, and two separate titration protocols. It also includes a \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explains the choice of temperature range and reagent concentrations, demonstrating a clear understanding of the experimental design. In contrast, Essay A's liquid-liquid extraction procedure is standard and lacks this level of justification or preliminary planning.\n\nFinally, Essay B's approach to safety, ethical, and environmental considerations is exemplary. It provides a detailed tabular risk assessment identifying multiple specific hazards (\"Flammable liquids,\" \"Hazardous liquids,\" \"Oil is flammable\") and corresponding precautions. It also explicitly addresses ethical and environmental issues regarding waste disposal. Essay A identifies key safety risks associated with dichloromethane but completely omits any discussion of the significant environmental impact of using and disposing of a chlorinated solvent, which is a major oversight for this criterion.",
