  "reasoning": "Both essays provide some reasonable ideas about the economic factors that influenced economic development in China and Cuba. Both essays define globalization as the increased flow of ideas, capital, goods and services, capital, technology, and people across international borders due to increased integration and interdependence. Essay A shows a more nuanced understanding by considering multiple factors contributing to the growth in China, including economic liberalization and market reforms as key factors in China' a economic success. Essay B primarily focuses on the influence of foreign aid, which while important, isn't as central as the economic policies highlighted in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B is more descriptive than analytical, with more statements of facts rather than explaining the nuanced impact of these on economic growth. However, both essays fall short in their analysis of the concept of economic development. Neither essay engages with the broader human element, for example, and how this has impacted different groups of people within the respective countries. Both essays also lack a discussion of the limitations of the sources used to support their claims. Therefore, although I think that Essay A is marginally better because its arguments were more balanced, both could have been improved by including a more in-ouepth analysis and evaluating their sources more critically.",
