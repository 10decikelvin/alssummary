  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all aspects of the Exploration criterion. Essay B's research question, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...reacting with blue food colouring...determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is focused, specific, and clearly defines the independent and dependent variables. In contrast, Essay A's question is poorly phrased and inappropriately includes the method (\"Using Complexometric Titration will determine...\"). Furthermore, Essay B provides extensive and relevant background information, discussing reaction kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the chemical properties of bleach, demonstrating a strong theoretical foundation. Essay A's introduction is minimal, failing to provide any context for why calcium content in milk might change or the chemical principles of the titration.\n\nThe methodology in Essay B is exemplary. It includes a detailed preliminary experiment to determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach, which showcases excellent scientific practice. The main procedure is clear, precise, and easily replicable, with specific volumes and concentrations listed. Essay A's procedure is vague, omitting crucial details such as how the milk samples of different ages were obtained or prepared.\n\nFinally, Essay B presents a comprehensive and well-justified list of independent, dependent, and controlled variables in a clear table format. Essay A completely omits a dedicated discussion of variables, which is a major flaw in experimental design. While both essays contain adequate safety assessments, Essay B's overall planning, depth of understanding, and clarity of communication make it far superior.",
