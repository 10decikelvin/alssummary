  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior approach to Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a direct, quantitative relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This allows for a much more controlled and scientific investigation compared to Essay A's question, which relies on a qualitative and subjective independent variable (\"pollution level\"). Essay B's background information is highly relevant, explaining the chemical principles of heterogeneous catalysis and justifying the choice of reaction. Furthermore, its methodology shows a high level of personal engagement and thoughtful design, as evidenced by the student's decision to \"variate from standard practice\" by measuring time for a fixed volume and the justification for using six data points and two different volumes to strengthen the correlation. The variables in Essay B are presented in an exemplary table with clear justifications for how each is controlled, particularly the commendable effort to standardize the surface area of the catalyst.\n\nEssay A has several strengths, most notably the detailed background explanation of the complex chemistry behind the Winkler titration method, complete with balanced equations. The methodology is also detailed, including the important step of standardizing the titrant, and the risk assessment is thorough. However, the experimental design is fundamentally weaker because the independent variable\u2014\"pollution level\"\u2014is not a measurable quantity but a rank based on observation and secondary research. This makes it difficult to establish a clear, causal relationship. While the procedure is complex, the overall exploration and design in Essay B are more scientifically rigorous, demonstrating a deeper understanding of experimental control and variable manipulation.",
