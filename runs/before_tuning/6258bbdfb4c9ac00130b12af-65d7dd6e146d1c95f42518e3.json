  "reasoning": "The response presents a decent effort but could be stronger by offering more specific feedback comparing the student responses. Both responses accurately identify the significance of specific literary devices like metaphors and contrast, but could demonstrate deeper analysis and comparison of how effectively each essay analyzes them.  While both mention relevant stylistic features like dialogue and character choices, they offer limited direct comparison, simply summarizing what each text is about. The discussion on character development is generic, lacking depth. Both responses identify key themes such as societal constraints but don' to explore the nuances of how the protagonists challenge norms or the lasting effects of internal conflict. Comparing specific character relationships (Jane Eyre/Helen vs. Scout/Aunt Alexandra) and stylistic choices across texts would have improved the response. Overall, although there is identification of literary elements, both responses lack analysis of their combined effect on the texts' messages.",
