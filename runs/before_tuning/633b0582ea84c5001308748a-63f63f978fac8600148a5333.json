  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B: Exploration. Its research question is highly focused and specific, clearly outlining the independent and dependent variables, the system under investigation, the range of the independent variable, and the method of quantification: \"How does varying pH of Cu(II) aqueous solution, under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 \u2013 5.0), affect the percentage removal of Cu\u00b2\u207a ions via orange peels, quantified via UV-vis spectrophotometry?\". In contrast, Essay A presents two separate research questions, which slightly reduces its focus.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is exemplary, providing a detailed scientific rationale for every key decision, most notably the choice of the acidic pH range to avoid the precipitation of Cu(OH)\u2082. This demonstrates critical thinking and engagement with scientific literature. While Essay A's background is relevant and appropriate, it is more descriptive of general principles rather than being used to justify methodological choices with the same level of depth.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is exceptionally well-developed and demonstrates significant personal input. The inclusion of \"Preliminary Trials\" shows an iterative and thoughtful approach to experimental design, where initial challenges were identified and overcome. The table of variables is comprehensive, with clear and insightful justifications for each control. Essay A's methodology is appropriate for a database investigation, but it lacks the complexity and evidence of independent scientific planning seen in Essay B. Finally, Essay B includes a thorough and specific section on safety, ethical, and environmental concerns, which is a required component for an experimental investigation and is handled proficiently.",
