  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of achievement for Criterion B, making this a difficult decision. Essay A is commendable for its focused research question, clear link to real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia, and excellent justification for its choice of measurement technique, detailing the progression from visual observation to a lux sensor. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, meticulously explaining not just what was controlled, but why and how.\n\nHowever, Essay B displays a slightly greater depth of chemical understanding and more sophisticated methodological problem-solving. The student successfully identifies multiple complex issues, such as the vitamin B6 solution being colorless and the subsequent precipitation of the copper(II) complex. To solve these, the student researches and applies advanced concepts like crystal field theory to justify complexation and micelle formation to maintain solubility, which is highly impressive. Furthermore, Essay B demonstrates outstanding safety and ethical engagement by identifying a carcinogenic reagent (Chlorazol Black) in a literature method and conducting a pilot study to find a safer alternative. While Essay A's exploration is excellent, Essay B's iterative process of identifying a problem, researching advanced chemical solutions, and adapting the methodology for safety reasons shows a marginally higher level of personal engagement and scientific ingenuity. The complexity of the chemical challenges overcome in Essay B gives it a slight edge.",
