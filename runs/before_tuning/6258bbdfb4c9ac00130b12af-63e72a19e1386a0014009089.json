  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. Essay B has a stronger introduction and background section, providing a clear real-world context (global warming's effect on marine life) and explaining the underlying chemistry of oxygen dissolution and the \"salting out\" effect in excellent detail. Its research question is also very well-formulated, including units and uncertainties. Essay A's background is adequate but less detailed, and its hypothesis for the saponification value is stated as unknown due to a lack of research, which is a minor weakness.\n\nHowever, Essay A is significantly stronger in its methodology and safety considerations. The methodology in Essay A is meticulously detailed, including a separate section justifying the choice of temperatures, concentrations, and sample sizes, which shows a higher level of critical thinking about the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay A includes an excellent, detailed risk assessment table that addresses multiple specific hazards (flammability, corrosivity, glassware) and provides appropriate precautions, in addition to considering ethical and environmental issues. In stark contrast, Essay B's safety table is completely empty, indicating a critical omission of this essential aspect of experimental design. This failure to address safety is a major flaw. Therefore, despite Essay B's strong theoretical introduction, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and thorough approach to the actual experimental planning and execution required for Criterion B.",
