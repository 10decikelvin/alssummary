  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong \"Exploration\" sections, making the choice difficult. Both have well-defined, focused research questions with clear independent and dependent variables.\n\nEssay A's strength lies in its sophisticated background information and methodology. The rationale clearly links a real-world concept (body buffers) to a feasible lab investigation, explaining the substitution of the carbonate-bicarbonate system for the carbonic acid system. The discussion of buffer capacity is thorough, incorporating both a practical formula and a more advanced theoretical one, which demonstrates a high level of engagement. The methodology is precise, employing modern equipment like a pH probe and drop counter, and the variables are very clearly defined with justification. The risk assessment is concise and relevant.\n\nEssay B also provides a strong ecological rationale and a detailed chemical background on the \"salting out\" effect. Its justification for using the Winkler method over a DO meter is practical and shows good planning. However, its procedure, while detailed, relies on a more traditional titration technique which is more susceptible to procedural errors. Furthermore, the safety table, while extensive, is somewhat generic, focusing heavily on first-aid rather than proactive risk mitigation within the specific lab context.\n\nUltimately, Essay A is slightly superior. Its connection between the theoretical background (e.g., Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, different buffer capacity formulas) and the experimental design feels more integrated and demonstrates a deeper level of scientific thinking. The methodology is more robust due to the use of precise instrumentation, and the overall presentation is more focused and professional.",
