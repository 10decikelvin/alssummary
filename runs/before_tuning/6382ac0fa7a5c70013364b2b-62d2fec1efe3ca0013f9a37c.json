  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more sophisticated approach to the Exploration criterion. Its research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is focused, well-defined, and sets up a genuine investigation into a relationship between variables. The background information is excellent, connecting theoretical concepts like the rate law, pKa values, and the Arrhenius equation directly to the experimental design, which adds depth and demonstrates a high level of understanding. Furthermore, the identification and management of variables in Essay B are exemplary; the independent (type of acid, temperature), dependent (rate), and controlled variables are all correctly identified and logically justified.\n\nWhile Essay A presents a viable investigation, its research question is more descriptive than investigative, focusing on determination and comparison rather than exploring a relationship. The personal engagement is clear, but the scientific background is less detailed than in Essay B. The most significant weakness in Essay A lies in its \"Variables\" section, where it incorrectly identifies the \"Mass of sample\" as both an independent and a controlled variable, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental design. Although its procedure is clear and its safety considerations are adequate, the flawed variable identification and less sophisticated scientific inquiry make it the weaker of the two submissions for Criterion B. Essay B's methodology, which involves collecting data across a range of temperatures to calculate a derived value (activation energy), represents a more advanced level of scientific investigation.",
