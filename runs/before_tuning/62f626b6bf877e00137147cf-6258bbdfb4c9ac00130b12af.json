  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better than Essay A across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its thoroughness and scientific depth. Its research question is clear and focused, and it is supported by extensive background information that explains the chemical principles of Acid Value and Saponification Value, directly linking them to the investigation's purpose. The methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, including reagent preparation, a justification for the chosen parameters, and a preliminary experiment, making it replicable and well-considered. Furthermore, Essay B features an exemplary variables section, with a comprehensive table for controlled variables that explains not just what and how to control them, but also why it's scientifically necessary.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is significantly underdeveloped. While its research question is acceptable, the background information is almost non-existent, offering no scientific context for the experiment. The methodology provided in Essay A is vague and incomplete; for example, it mentions an \"Ammonia Buffer\" in the risk assessment but omits it from the procedure, a critical error for this type of titration. Most notably, Essay A completely fails to identify and discuss the controlled variables, which is a fundamental component of experimental design and a major flaw. While Essay A does have a basic risk assessment, Essay B's consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental factors is far more detailed and structured. Overall, Essay B demonstrates a clear, logical, and scientifically rigorous approach to exploration, whereas Essay A lacks the necessary detail and planning to be considered a strong piece of work.",
