  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of exploration and personal engagement, making it the stronger essay for Criterion B. Its research question, \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction...\", is highly specific, original, and grounded in a clear gap identified in existing scientific literature (real food vs. model food). The background section is robust, thoroughly explaining the complex chemistry of the Maillard reaction, Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), and the principles of colorimetry via the Lambert-Beer Law, even justifying the specific wavelength used based on color theory. Furthermore, the methodology is exceptionally detailed and rigorous, with precise instructions for creating a phosphate buffer and a comprehensive table of controlled variables that not only lists them but critically explains their potential impact on the results.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B presents a competent but very standard investigation into Vitamin C content. While the research question is focused and the background science is correct, it lacks the originality and depth of Essay A. The topic is a common one for IB Chemistry, and the methodology, while clear, is less complex and described with slightly less precision than that of Essay A (e.g., \"add 50 ml of distilled water periodically\"). While Essay B has a slightly better-structured risk assessment that explicitly mentions ethical and environmental concerns, Essay A's overall scientific ambition, depth of background research, and meticulous methodological planning are far superior, showcasing a much stronger fulfillment of the exploration criterion.",
