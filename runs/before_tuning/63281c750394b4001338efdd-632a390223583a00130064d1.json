  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and specific, clearly stating the independent variable's range (\"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\"). The background information is comprehensive, seamlessly integrating concepts from chemistry (polymers, plasticizers) and physics (Young's Modulus) to provide a strong theoretical foundation. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining a sophisticated procedure that uses modern data-logging tools (Vernier LabQuest, Tracker software) to ensure precision. A major strength of Essay B is its treatment of variables; it not only identifies and controls key variables with justification but also astutely discusses uncontrolled variables and their potential impact, showing a high level of critical thought. The safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are thorough, mature, and well-presented in a clear table, even touching upon the ethics of using food materials for research.\n\nEssay A, while competent, is weaker in several key areas. Although its research question is clear, the methodology lacks crucial detail, failing to specify the different concentrations of KNO\u2083 that will be tested. This is a significant omission that hinders the reproducibility of the experiment. Furthermore, Essay A incorrectly identifies the dependent variable as \"temperature difference\" when it is actually the calculated \"specific heat capacity.\" While the background information is relevant, it is less detailed than in Essay B. The safety precautions are adequate but minimal, and the inclusion of an \"Evaluation\" section within the methodology is structurally incorrect for an IB IA, as this belongs in a separate section. Therefore, due to its superior detail, conceptual understanding, methodological rigor, and critical awareness of variables, Essay B is clearly the better submission.",
