  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong attempts at Criterion B. However, Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and methodological rigor.\n\nEssay A has a clear research question and provides good background information on complexometric titrations. The justification for choosing the titration method over others is a strength, as is the detailed table of safety precautions and limitations. However, a significant weakness is the inconsistency in the stated temperatures for the independent variable between the research question (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 \u00b0C) and the variables table (20, 35, 50, 65, 80 \u00b0C), which indicates a lack of care in the experimental design. Furthermore, some procedural details, such as using a 50cm\u00b3 measuring cylinder to measure 10.0cm\u00b3 of milk, are not optimal for precision.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, is more polished and thorough. The rationale is excellent, effectively linking the investigation of dissolved oxygen to the significant global issue of climate change. The background information is comprehensive, not only explaining the Winkler titration method with all relevant equations but also comparing it to alternative methods. The hypothesis is clearly stated and justified with both chemical principles (intermolecular forces, kinetic theory) and supporting literature graphs. The methodology is exceptionally detailed and replicable, and the identification and control of variables are meticulous, addressing subtle factors like atmospheric pressure and introducing reagents below the surface to prevent aeration. This demonstrates a superior level of planning and understanding of the experimental system.\n\nOverall, while Essay A is competent, Essay B's sophisticated rationale, deeper scientific background, more ambitious scope (two independent variables), and meticulously planned methodology make it the stronger of the two.",
