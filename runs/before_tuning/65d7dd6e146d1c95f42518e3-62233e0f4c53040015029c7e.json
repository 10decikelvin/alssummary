  "decision": "submission a",
  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a strong grasp of the fundamental concepts, but I am giving the edge to Submission A. Submission A's research question is more clearly focused on a quantifiable outcome ('amount of NaOH added') compared to Submission B's more general 'buffer capacity'. This focused approach allows for a more straightforward and direct investigation. While both candidates include relevant background information, Submission B's explanation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and its connection to temperature dependence feels slightly more comprehensive and directly applicable to the investigation. However, Submission A's methodology is presented in a much clearer, step-by-step format, making it easier to follow and replicate. The inclusion of a detailed risk assessment table in Submission A also showcases a stronger understanding of lab safety protocols. The data analysis section in Submission B is more robust, explicitly mentioning calculations for mean, standard deviation, and even correlation coefficient, which strengthens its scientific rigor. Overall, while Submission B shows a slightly better theoretical understanding, Submission A presents a more well-rounded and clearly communicated scientific investigation.",
