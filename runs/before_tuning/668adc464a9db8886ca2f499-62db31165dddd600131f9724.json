  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much more thorough and well-developed exploration of its research question. Both essays establish good personal and scientific context for their investigations. However, Essay A excels in its detailed and meticulous planning. The background information is comprehensive, covering not only the theory of kinetics and spectrophotometry but also the practical steps taken to determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach via titration, complete with relevant chemical equations. This demonstrates a high level of engagement and preparatory work. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is exemplary; it clearly defines all variables, justifies the chosen range for the independent variable, and presents a robust table of controlled variables explaining their significance and the method of control. Its safety and environmental considerations are detailed and specific.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a solid introduction and a hypothesis well-supported by theory (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution), is critically incomplete. The section for variables is empty, and there is no methodology, list of materials, or any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations provided. This lack of a detailed experimental plan is a major omission for Criterion B, which assesses the design and planning of the investigation. Therefore, Essay A's comprehensive and well-justified experimental design makes it substantially better.",
