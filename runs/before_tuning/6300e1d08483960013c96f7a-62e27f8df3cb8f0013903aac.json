  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question is highly specific, focused, and directly linked to the IB Chemistry syllabus, showing clear personal engagement by connecting it to prior experiments. The background information is comprehensive and sophisticated, correctly explaining complex concepts like the reaction mechanism, Beer-Lambert law, rate laws, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly relevant to the investigation. The methodology is detailed, well-justified, and refined through preliminary testing, which shows a thoughtful and scientific approach. Furthermore, Essay B includes an exemplary safety, ethical, and environmental considerations section, thoroughly addressing the risks of each chemical and outlining specific mitigation strategies.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a simpler investigation. While the topic is relevant, the research question is less focused. The background information is generally correct but lacks depth compared to Essay B. The most significant weakness in Essay A is the methodological flaw of using a constant mass (5 grams) for each salt rather than a constant number of moles. Since the hypothesis is based on the number of ions produced per formula unit, using equal moles would have been the correct scientific approach to ensure a fair comparison. Finally, Essay A completely omits any discussion of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency in this criterion. Therefore, Essay B's meticulous planning, depth of understanding, and superior experimental design make it clearly better.",
