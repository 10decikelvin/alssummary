  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality for Criterion B. Its research question is focused, well-defined, and manageable: \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\" In contrast, Essay A's research question is overly ambitious, attempting to compare three different substances using two distinct methodologies, which is effectively two investigations in one.\n\nEssay B's background section is exemplary, showing strong personal engagement that logically leads to the research question, detailed chemical theory including half-equations and Faraday's law, and references to previous studies. Essay A has good personal engagement but a less detailed theoretical background.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant differentiator. Essay B's procedure is meticulous, replicable, and shows a sophisticated understanding of experimental design, including small but crucial details like cleaning the electrodes and marking a splint to control the distance between them. Conversely, Essay A's methodology contains major flaws that would compromise the quality of the data, most notably the repeated use of a measuring cylinder for critical volume measurements in a titration where a volumetric pipette is required.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its treatment of variables. It correctly identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, and for each controlled variable, it explains both *why* it must be controlled and precisely *how* it will be controlled. Essay A's identification of the independent variable is confused, and the methods for control are less rigorous (e.g., using the \"same Bunsen Burner\" to control temperature). Finally, while both essays have good safety sections, Essay B's environmental considerations are more specific and demonstrate a higher level of awareness regarding chemical disposal.",
