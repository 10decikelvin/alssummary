  "reasoning": "The evaluation of these two essays for Criterion B reveals a trade-off between theoretical depth and methodological completeness. Essay A presents a significantly more sophisticated and detailed scientific background. It expertly connects the biological relevance of Vitamin C to the underlying redox chemistry of the titration method, stating, \"To measure ascorbic acid concentration ascorbic acid will be oxidized with iodine... The iodine is reduced to iodide ions.\" Furthermore, its hypothesis is justified with advanced chemical principles like the \"Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve theory,\" demonstrating a high level of understanding.\n\nHowever, Essay A is critically incomplete as presented. Key components of Criterion B, such as the table of variables and any mention of safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, are missing. In contrast, Essay B provides a complete and well-structured exploration. It clearly outlines the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, including specific methods for control (e.g., \"Each solution will be heated for exactly 600 seconds\"). It also includes a dedicated safety section and a detailed, replicable procedure with a full apparatus list, which Essay A lacks.\n\nWhile Essay B's chemical background on why specific heat capacity changes is less detailed than Essay A's (\"The ions of potassium nitrate are held in a rigid matrix of water molecules\"), it is relevant and sufficient to establish the context for the investigation. Because Criterion B assesses the entire exploration\u2014including the research question, background, and the complete methodology\u2014Essay B's comprehensive and well-planned experimental design makes it the stronger submission. Essay A's superior theoretical discussion cannot compensate for its failure to present a complete and viable experimental plan.",
