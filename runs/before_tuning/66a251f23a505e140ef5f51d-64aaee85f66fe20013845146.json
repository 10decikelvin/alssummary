  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards for Exploration. Essay A is substantially stronger across all aspects of this criterion.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly focused and sophisticated research question: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures... on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\". This question establishes a clear relationship between a continuous independent variable (temperature) and a dependent variable (Kc), which is grounded in core chemical principles. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"Investigating the caffeine content (mg) in different brands of black tea...\", is a simple brand comparison, which is less scientifically rigorous.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay A is exemplary. It seamlessly integrates advanced concepts like Gibbs free energy, the Van't Hoff equation, and Le Chatelier's Principle to provide a robust theoretical framework for the investigation. It also clearly explains the methodology's basis in Beer-Lambert's law. Essay B's background is much more superficial, providing basic facts about caffeine and dichloromethane without delving into the chemical principles of liquid-liquid extraction, such as partition coefficients or polarity. Furthermore, Essay B's hypothesis is based on personal anecdote (\"I always have a heightened level of alertness\"), whereas Essay A's is derived directly from established chemical theory.\n\nThird, the methodology and control of variables in Essay A are meticulous. The inclusion of preliminary experiments to refine the procedure demonstrates personal engagement and a scientific approach. The controlled variables are presented in a detailed table with excellent justifications for *why* and *how* they are controlled using specific, high-precision equipment. Essay B's methodology is adequate but lacks this level of detail (e.g., evaporation conditions are not specified). While it identifies controlled variables, the justifications are weaker (\"ensuring a fair comparison\") and some methods, like poking a set number of holes in foil to control evaporation, are less scientifically sound than other available techniques.\n\nFinally, Essay A provides a comprehensive discussion of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, identifying specific chemical hazards, necessary precautions, and appropriate disposal methods as required by the IB. Essay B addresses safety well but completely omits any mention of ethical or environmental concerns, particularly the proper disposal of the chlorinated solvent dichloromethane, which is a significant oversight.\n\nOverall, Essay A demonstrates a deeper understanding of chemical principles, a more rigorous experimental design, and a more thorough consideration of the investigation's context, making it a much higher-quality submission for Criterion B.",
