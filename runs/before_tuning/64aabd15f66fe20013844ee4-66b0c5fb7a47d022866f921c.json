  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of the research question, background information, methodology, control of variables, and safety considerations as outlined in IB Chemistry's Criterion B for Exploration.\n\nEssay B presents a significantly more robust and scientifically sound exploration. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is excellently formulated, establishing a clear relationship between a continuous independent variable and a dependent variable. The background information provides a strong real-world context, a clear hypothesis grounded in chemical principles, and justifies the experiment's relevance. The methodology is meticulously detailed, including a serial dilution table and specific control measures, such as purchasing fuel \"off of the same gas station in the same purchase\" to ensure consistency. Furthermore, Essay B demonstrates a mature understanding of experimental limitations by acknowledging the large systematic error from heat loss in calorimetry but correctly arguing that it \"doesn't undermine the final conclusions obtained as the purpose is to just determine a trend\". The safety and environmental considerations are specific, appropriate, and thorough.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A suffers from a fundamental flaw in its experimental design. The research question itself is overly prescriptive, and the chosen methodology\u2014acid-base titration with NaOH\u2014is not selective for ascorbic acid and would neutralize other acids present in orange juice (like citric acid), a critical limitation the student correctly identifies but fails to mitigate. This flaw invalidates the entire premise of accurately measuring ascorbic acid concentration. Additionally, the chosen indicator (Bromothymol Blue) is inappropriate for a weak acid-strong base titration, and the visual endpoint would be obscured by the juice's color. Finally, the safety section is weak and dismissive, stating \"Gloves are not necessary,\" which goes against standard laboratory practice. While Essay A has a good controlled variables table, its core scientific approach is unviable, making Essay B the clear superior.",
