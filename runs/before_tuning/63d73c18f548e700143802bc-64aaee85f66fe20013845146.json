  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the effect of changing the acid to conjugate base ([A-]/[HA]) concentration ratio... on the buffering capacity,\" is highly focused, quantitative, and scientifically sophisticated. This is supported by an exemplary background section that delves into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and provides two distinct formulas for buffer capacity, showcasing a deep theoretical understanding. In contrast, Essay B's research question is more descriptive, and its background information, while relevant, lacks the same level of chemical theory, failing to explain the principles of solvent extraction in detail.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is more rigorous, employing precise tools like a pH probe and drop counter, and its control of variables is justified with clear scientific reasoning. For example, the controlled variables table in Essay A explains *why* temperature affects the equilibrium constant and thus the results. Essay B's methodology relies on a less precise technique of open-air evaporation, and its justification for controls can be weak, such as a hypothesis based on personal feeling rather than scientific literature (\"I predict that the Tetley Black Tea will have the highest caffeine level... This judgment is founded on the fact that I always have a heightened level of alertness\"). Finally, Essay A presents a comprehensive risk assessment in a structured table, addressing safety and environmental concerns appropriately. Essay B identifies key safety risks associated with dichloromethane but completely omits any discussion of environmental impact, a significant weakness for an experiment involving a chlorinated organic solvent.",
