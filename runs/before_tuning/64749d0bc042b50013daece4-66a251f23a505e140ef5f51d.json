  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B demonstrates a higher level of scientific thinking, depth, and refinement. Essay A is commendable for its clear connection to a relevant global issue, a well-structured hypothesis, and a comprehensive list of variables. Its methodology is clear and replicable. However, its safety considerations are somewhat generic, stating for most chemicals to be \"Heavily diluted with tap water before disposing safely into the lab sink.\"\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, showcases superior academic rigor. Its background information is exceptionally strong, weaving together complex concepts like Gibbs free energy, Van't Hoff's equation, and Le Chatelier's Principle to provide a robust theoretical foundation for the research question. The inclusion and detailed discussion of \"Preliminary experiments\" is a major strength, as it demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to experimental design and problem-solving. This foresight directly informs the methodology and strengthens the justification for the procedure. Furthermore, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are significantly more detailed and specific, identifying nuanced risks such as the potential liberation of toxic cyanide gas and outlining proper neutralization protocols, far exceeding the generic statements in Essay A. While both essays are well-written, Essay B's sophisticated theoretical grounding and evidence of methodological refinement make it the superior piece of work.",
