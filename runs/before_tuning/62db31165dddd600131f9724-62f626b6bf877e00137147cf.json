  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B exploration requirements. Essay A presents a focused and well-phrased research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", which clearly defines the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Its background section is thorough, connecting the biological importance of Vitamin C to the specific chemical principles of the redox titration that will be used, providing reaction equations and theoretical justification. Furthermore, Essay A's hypothesis is scientifically justified by referencing the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and its variables section is exemplary, not only identifying controlled variables but also explaining precisely why and how they must be controlled.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is significantly weaker and poorly structured. Its research question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is convoluted as it inappropriately includes the methodology within the question itself. The essay is critically incomplete, lacking any introduction, background information, hypothesis, or a dedicated variables section, which are all essential for a competent exploration. While Essay B does include a risk assessment, this single component cannot compensate for the absence of scientific context and planning. Crucially, the essay's own misplaced \"Evaluation\" section identifies a fundamental flaw in the methodology\u2014that EDTA is not selective for calcium\u2014a consideration that a high-quality exploration would have addressed in the planning stage rather than as a post-hoc weakness. Therefore, even though the provided text for Essay A is also incomplete, the quality of its planning, scientific grounding, and clarity far surpasses the fragmented and flawed approach of Essay B.",
