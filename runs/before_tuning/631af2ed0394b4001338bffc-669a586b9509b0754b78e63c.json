  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of competence in fulfilling the requirements of Criterion B. They each present a clearly defined and focused research question, a detailed methodology, and a thorough treatment of variables and safety considerations. Essay B is particularly strong in its safety assessment, providing a detailed table with hazard symbols and emergency actions, and its methodology is strengthened by the explicit mention of a pre-test to refine the experimental range.\n\nHowever, Essay A is the superior submission due to the significantly greater complexity, originality, and scientific depth of its exploration. The research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", moves beyond a simple cause-and-effect relationship to investigate a complex correlation in a variety of real-world colloidal systems. This is supported by an exceptionally well-researched background section that delves into the specific chemistry of casein micelles, calcium-phosphate bonding, and the equilibria governing free versus bound ions, explicitly justifying the investigation by identifying a gap in the scientific literature.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's investigation into the effect of acid concentration on the rate of reaction of an antacid is a very standard kinetics experiment. While executed flawlessly, the underlying scientific inquiry and background research into collision theory are less demanding and original. Essay A's ability to connect complex biochemical principles to a replicable experimental design, along with its thoughtful consideration of uncontrolled variables, demonstrates a more sophisticated and personal level of engagement with the scientific process. Therefore, the ambition and depth of Essay A's topic make it the stronger of the two.",
