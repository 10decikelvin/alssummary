  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more sophisticated exploration (Criterion B). The research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O)...?\", is well-focused and investigates a relationship between two continuous variables, which is characteristic of a high-level investigation. The background information provides a detailed and relevant explanation of the underlying chemistry, specifically the \"diverse ion effect,\" demonstrating a solid theoretical understanding. Most importantly, the proposed methodology is sound, appropriate, and thoughtfully designed; it includes a crucial calibration experiment for the spectrophotometer and a clever step of centrifuging the solution to remove particulates, showing meticulous planning.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear personal engagement, suffers from a critical flaw in its methodology. The research question aims to measure \"Ascorbic acid measured in moldm-3 using acid-base titration with...Sodium Hydroxide.\" However, this method is inappropriate because orange juice contains other acids (primarily citric acid) that will also be neutralized by the NaOH titrant. The student even acknowledges this fatal flaw, stating, \"Due to orange juice containing other acids such as Malic acid and Citric acid, these acids might have reacted with the NaOH the same as the Ascorbic acid.\" This means the experiment as designed cannot validly answer its own research question about ascorbic acid concentration. While Essay B correctly identifies variables for a titration, the fundamental choice of an acid-base titration over a more specific redox titration (e.g., with iodine) makes the entire experimental plan invalid for its stated purpose. Therefore, Essay A's well-conceived and appropriate methodology makes it significantly better.",
