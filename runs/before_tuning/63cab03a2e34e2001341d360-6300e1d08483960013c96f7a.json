  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific rigor and adherence to IB Chemistry standards for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in the detailed and complex methodology, which involves a multi-step titration (the Winkler method) and, crucially, a proper standardization of the sodium thiosulfate titrant. This shows an advanced understanding of analytical chemistry techniques appropriate for the Diploma Programme. Furthermore, Essay A includes an excellent and thorough risk assessment, identifying specific hazards for each chemical (e.g., \"Potassium Dichromate: Very hazardous. Can cause cancer.\") and outlining appropriate safety precautions, which is a key component of this criterion. While its research question is poorly phrased and contains a confusing contradiction about using \"secondary data\" when the method is clearly experimental, the quality of the experimental design, the depth of the background chemistry provided for the Winkler method, and the meticulous attention to safety far outweigh this initial flaw.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while starting with a clear research question and a solid theoretical background on freezing point depression, suffers from a critical methodological flaw and a complete omission of safety considerations. The experiment is designed to compare the effect of different salts by using a constant mass (5 grams) rather than a constant number of moles. This undermines the entire investigation, as the theoretical background correctly identifies the number of ions (related to moles) as the key factor. The methodology also lacks any mention of repeated trials to ensure reliability. Most significantly, there is no risk assessment or any mention of safety, environmental, or ethical considerations, which is a major failure for Criterion B. Although the controlled variables are presented well in a table, the flawed experimental design and lack of a safety section make it substantially weaker than Essay A.",
