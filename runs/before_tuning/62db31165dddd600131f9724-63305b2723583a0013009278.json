  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much more thorough and well-structured approach to the experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. The research question in Essay B is more precise, specifying the exact values of the independent variable to be tested. Its background section not only explains the underlying principles of electroplating but also directly links them to the experiment through Faraday's Laws, even providing the relevant equation. The methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, clearly outlining independent, dependent, and a comprehensive list of controlled variables with methods for their control. In contrast, Essay A's methodology is vague, lacking specific temperature values and details on how they will be maintained, and its variables section is incomplete. Crucially, Essay B includes a dedicated section on safety and environmental considerations, which is entirely absent from Essay A. While Essay A has a good introduction and relevant background chemistry, its overall planning and detail fall significantly short of the standard set by Essay B.",
