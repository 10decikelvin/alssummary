  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of exploration compared to Essay A, primarily due to its exceptionally thorough and well-considered methodology. The procedure in Essay B is meticulously detailed, outlining separate, replicable steps for standardizing two different reagents (KOH and ethanolic KOH), heating the samples, and performing two distinct titration techniques, including reflux. This level of detail, as seen in sections like \"Chemical preparation and heating of sample,\" showcases a sophisticated understanding of experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B includes an exemplary risk assessment in a clear table, identifying specific hazards like \"Flammable liquids (ethanol & ether)\" and providing targeted precautions, which is far more comprehensive than the generic safety notes in Essay A. Essay B also presents a more extensive and well-justified list of controlled variables, considering factors like \"Microbial Contamination\" and \"Light\" that demonstrate a deeper engagement with the experimental system.\n\nWhile Essay A has a well-focused research question and a strong theoretical background explaining the diverse ion effect, its methodology contains a significant scientific flaw. It proposes making a \"0.6M CaSO4\" stock solution, which is impossible given that calcium sulfate is sparingly soluble with a solubility around 0.015 M. This error fundamentally undermines the credibility of the entire experimental design. In contrast, although Essay B's research question is phrased less elegantly and its background is slightly repetitive, its practical planning is sound, robust, and demonstrates a much higher level of competence in designing a viable scientific investigation. The methodological strength and comprehensive safety considerations in Essay B make it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
