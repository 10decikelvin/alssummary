  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably stronger in its exploration due to its superior focus, detail, and scientific rigor. The research question in Essay B, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is exceptionally clear and focused, precisely defining the independent and dependent variables. In contrast, Essay A's question is convoluted by introducing two independent variables: salt concentration and \"different water sources,\" which weakens the focus of the investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section is exemplary, showing strong personal engagement (\"I gained an interest in jewellery making\") that is seamlessly woven into a well-researched scientific context, including citations of previous studies. While Essay A also provides personal context and relevant chemistry (the Winkler method), Essay B's integration is more sophisticated. The methodology is another area where Essay B excels; its procedure is highly detailed and replicable, and it includes a comprehensive list of apparatus with uncertainties, and even a separate table analyzing potential random errors. Essay A's methodology lacks key details, such as uncertainties for the burette and pipettes, which are critical for a titration.\n\nEssay B's treatment of variables is a key strength, not only identifying them but also providing detailed explanations for *why* they must be controlled and precisely *how* this will be achieved (e.g., using a marked wooden splint to maintain electrode distance). Essay A's explanation of its controlled variables is more generic. Finally, while both essays address safety and environmental concerns, Essay B's approach is more thorough, suggesting multiple specific and responsible methods for chemical disposal (e.g., heating CuSO4 to form crystals or mixing with sawdust), demonstrating a deeper level of consideration than Essay A's more standard neutralization plan. Overall, Essay B presents a meticulously planned, well-researched, and highly focused investigation that is superior to Essay A in every aspect of Criterion B.",
