  "reasoning": "Essay B is substantially better as it provides a complete and highly detailed exploration, whereas Essay A is critically incomplete. Essay A begins well with a clear research question, a personal rationale, and a solid explanation of the underlying chemistry of ascorbic acid and redox titrations. However, it abruptly ends after the header for the variables section, completely omitting the methodology, the identification and control of variables, and any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. These omissions are fatal for Criterion B.\n\nIn stark contrast, Essay B is exemplary in its thoroughness. Its research question is ambitious yet well-defined, specifying both independent variables, their ranges, and the precise measurement technique. The background information is comprehensive, not only explaining the Winkler titration with relevant equations but also justifying this methodological choice over other alternatives, which demonstrates a high level of critical thinking. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is exceptional; it presents a detailed table of controlled variables, explaining not only *why* each must be controlled but also *how* this will be achieved in the lab (e.g., \"all transfer pipette solutions were introduced under the surface of the solution to reduce the amount of oxygen introduced\"). Finally, the procedure is detailed and repeatable, and the safety section is robust, addressing specific chemical hazards, proper disposal, and environmental awareness through \"judicial consumption.\" Overall, Essay B demonstrates a far superior understanding of experimental design and scientific rigor.",
