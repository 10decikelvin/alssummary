  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a superior level of exploration and planning compared to Essay A. The research question in Essay B is exceptionally focused and its development is thoughtfully explained, detailing how initial challenges led to a more viable and refined question, which is a hallmark of excellent scientific inquiry. While Essay A's research question is appropriate, it is a very standard topic and lacks the narrative of scientific process evident in B. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is more robust, as it includes a dedicated \"Pre-test\" section that justifies the choice of concentrations and the experimental duration. Essay B also provides a far more comprehensive section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, breaking down risks by chemical and explicitly discussing waste minimization and proper disposal, whereas Essay A's treatment is limited to immediate physical safety risks. The background information in Essay B is also richer, linking the experiment to a real-world context (pharmacology) and providing a more detailed chemical explanation (e.g., the carbonic acid intermediate). Essay A provides a competent, standard investigation, but Essay B showcases a more thorough, reflective, and sophisticated approach to experimental design from start to finish.",
