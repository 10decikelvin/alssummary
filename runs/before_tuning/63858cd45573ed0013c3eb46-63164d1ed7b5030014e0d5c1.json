  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably stronger in its execution of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide?\", is highly focused and supported by a detailed, relevant background section that explains the theory of heterogeneous catalysis and active sites. The methodology is meticulously planned, with exceptional attention to the control of variables; for example, the essay not only identifies \"Surface area of MnO\u2082\" as a controlled variable but also explains the practical steps taken to manage it (\"10g were ground per set, using 200 turns at medium pressure\"). Furthermore, Essay A's safety, ethical, and environmental (SEE) section is exemplary, citing specific resources (CLEAPPS), discussing hazards for different chemical concentrations, and thoughtfully linking the procedure to the principles of green chemistry.\n\nEssay B, while based on a good research question (\"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\"), exhibits several weaknesses in its exploration. The methodology contains steps that could introduce significant random error, such as crushing the pepper to a \"paste like\" consistency and straining it, without fully addressing the potential for inconsistent extraction and loss of sample. The controlled variables are well-identified, but the detail on *how* they are controlled is less rigorous than in Essay A. Most notably, the environmental consideration is dismissed with \"No significant environmental concerns,\" which overlooks the disposal of chemical and food waste. While Essay B is a competent investigation, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor, foresight, and thoroughness in its design and contextualization.",
