  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger fulfillment of Criterion B (Exploration) compared to Essay A. The research question in Essay B is highly specific and focused, stating the exact temperatures and uncertainties: \"How does varying temperature (19\u00b0C; 22\u00b0C; 29\u00b0C; 31\u00b0C; 39\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C) affect the oscillation pattern...\". In contrast, Essay A's question is more general: \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid...\". While Essay A provides a good, relevant background on ascorbic acid and titration, Essay B's background on the complex Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction is more advanced and is exceptionally well-supported by a \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that justifies the experimental design, detailing the iterative process of selecting a lux sensor over other methods. This justification of the methodology is a key strength that showcases genuine exploration.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's section on variables is exemplary; it features a detailed table of controlled variables, each with a clear reason for control and the method of control, such as controlling \"Ambient light\" by blacking out the lab. Essay A's variable table is incomplete in the provided text, representing a significant omission. Essay B also includes a comprehensive section on \"Safety, Environmental and Ethical Considerations,\" identifying specific chemical hazards and even noting the decision to reduce reagent volumes to minimize environmental impact. Essay A lacks this section entirely. Overall, Essay B presents a far more thorough, well-planned, and personally developed investigation that aligns perfectly with the highest standards of Criterion B.",
