  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B content and would likely score well. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific exploration and justification. Its background research is exemplary, not only providing context on dissolved oxygen but also thoroughly investigating and comparing various measurement techniques (colorimetric, sensors, Winkler method). This detailed research directly and logically leads to the formulation of its evaluative research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...\". This shows a more authentic and sophisticated scientific process than simply investigating a known relationship. Furthermore, Essay A's risk assessment is more specific and thorough, listing individual chemical hazards and corresponding precautions, which is a hallmark of a well-planned experiment.\n\nEssay B is also very strong, with a clear real-world context, a well-structured methodology, and excellent tables for controlled variables and solution preparation. The inclusion of explicit assumptions is a noteworthy strength that demonstrates critical thinking about the experimental model. However, the research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion...\", while valid, is a more standard investigation. The background, while good, serves to justify a known relationship rather than exploring a methodological problem as in Essay A. Additionally, its safety assessment is slightly more generic compared to the chemical-specific breakdown in Essay A. Ultimately, Essay A's superior integration of background research into the development of a more nuanced research question makes it the better example of Criterion B.",
