While both responses provide some interesting information regarding their sources and applications, they lack specific details needed to properly evaluate the investigations. \n\t- The first student, though mentioning they used a data logger for their analysis but presents it qualitatively in a results table of words such as 'bubbles were observed in the test-tube'. \n\t- The second essay has a more detailed list of materials and materials and method which allows for a better assessment of its validity. \n\t- The results are clearly displayed in a table but lack units making the results hard to quantify. \n\t- They also don't indicate how many tests they did for each measurement, or if they calculated an average.\n- However, while it lacks important quantitative data. It is well written otherwise, providing good background information. Overall, both responses get an equal low score.",
