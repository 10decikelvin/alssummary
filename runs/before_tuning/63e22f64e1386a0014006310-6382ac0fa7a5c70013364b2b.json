  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration (Criterion B) than Essay B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, breaking down a complex topic into two focused, investigable parts: the effect of carbon chain length and the effect of isomeric classification on the enthalpy of combustion. The background section is comprehensive, effectively linking classroom concepts to the research question and citing relevant chemical principles like homologous series and calorimetry. Most importantly, Essay A's methodology is rigorous; the variables are correctly identified, and the controlled variables are not only listed but justified with clear reasons and practical methods for control (e.g., \"Different calorimeters may possess different specific heat capacities... The same calorimeter was used for every trial.\"). This showcases a high level of scientific thinking.\n\nEssay B, while showing good personal engagement, has several weaknesses in its exploration. The identification of variables is less precise; for instance, it lists \"Mass of sample\" as an independent variable, when the true independent variable is the *source* of the calcium carbonate (chalk, seashell, rangoli). The dependent variable is also misidentified as an intermediate measurement rather than the final calculated percentage. Furthermore, the methodology contains significant flaws, such as the weak attempt to control temperature by using \"the same Bunsen Burner,\" which is an unreliable heat source, and a direct contradiction in the procedure regarding heating time (\"heated for 3 minutes\" vs. \"repeated until a constant mass was obtained\"). While Essay B has a slightly more thorough safety and environmental section, the fundamental weaknesses in its experimental design and scientific reasoning make Essay A clearly superior in fulfilling the requirements of Criterion B. Essay A's plan is more robust, scientifically sound, and demonstrates a deeper understanding of how to conduct a controlled experiment.",
