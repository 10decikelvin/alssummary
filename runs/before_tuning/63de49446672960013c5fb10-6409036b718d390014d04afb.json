  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate an exceptionally high level of quality for Criterion B, making this a very close comparison. Essay B's research question is well-defined, and its background provides excellent real-world context by linking the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction to cardiac arrhythmia. Its methodology is creative, with a strong \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section that clearly outlines the thoughtful, iterative process of selecting a lux sensor to measure oscillations, justifying this choice over other methods. Furthermore, its safety and environmental considerations are outstanding, particularly the specific action of scaling down the reaction to minimize waste.\n\nHowever, Essay A presents a slightly more sophisticated and rigorous exploration. Its background provides a deep dive into the relevant chemical principles, including crystal field theory to justify the use of a copper(II) complex for UV-Vis analysis. The \"Development and pilot studies\" section is exemplary, showing advanced problem-solving skills; the student identifies issues with tablet binders and precipitate formation and then researches and implements a complex solution involving filtration and micelle formation with Crystal Violet and SDS, even citing external literature (Khudhair et al, 2019) to support their choices. This multi-step, chemically complex procedure, combined with the rigorous use of a calibration curve and the Beer-Lambert law, demonstrates a more profound engagement with quantitative analytical chemistry principles. While Essay B is excellent, the depth of chemical problem-solving and the application of advanced analytical techniques in Essay A give it a marginal edge.",
