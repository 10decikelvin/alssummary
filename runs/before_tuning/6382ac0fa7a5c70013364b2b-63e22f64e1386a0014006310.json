  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a higher level of achievement for Criterion B. The research question in Essay B is notably more sophisticated, as it is broken down into two distinct, focused parts that investigate the impact of both carbon chain length and isomeric classification on the enthalpy of combustion. This shows a deeper level of inquiry than Essay A's question, which compares sources and methods. Essay B's background information is significantly more thorough and scientifically grounded, defining key concepts like homologous series, alcohol classification, and the principles of combustion, directly linking them to the hypothesis. In contrast, Essay A's background is more narrative-driven and lighter on the chemical theory behind back titration and thermal decomposition.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's handling of variables is exemplary. It correctly identifies the independent and dependent variables and presents the controlled variables in a detailed table explaining not just what is being controlled, but *why* and *how*. Essay A, on the other hand, misidentifies its primary independent variable as \"Mass of sample,\" when it should be the \"Source of the sample\" and the \"Methodology.\" While both essays provide adequate safety precautions, Essay B's clear table format is highly effective. Finally, Essay A's methodology contains a significant procedural flaw by stating a measuring cylinder will be used to measure a 25 cm\u00b3 aliquot for titration, an error that fundamentally undermines the accuracy of that method, whereas Essay B's procedure is standard and appropriately described.",
