  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its sophisticated and well-justified exploration. The research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is evaluative and demonstrates a high level of engagement beyond a simple cause-and-effect investigation. The background information is comprehensive, linking the topic to a real-world context (global warming) and then delving into the specific chemical principles of both dissolved oxygen equilibrium and the Winkler titration method itself, complete with relevant equations. The methodology is detailed, appropriate for the level, and shows evidence of refinement through \"preliminary trials.\" Furthermore, Essay A includes a thorough and specific risk assessment, addressing chemical hazards, PPE, and environmental disposal.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question and relevant background on freezing point depression, suffers from a critical flaw in its experimental design. The methodology controls for the *mass* of the salts (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\") rather than the *moles*. Since freezing point depression is a colligative property dependent on the number of solute particles, using equal masses of salts with different molar masses introduces a confounding variable and undermines the investigation's validity. While the background correctly identifies the importance of the Van't Hoff factor ('i'), the procedure fails to translate this understanding into a valid experimental control. Additionally, Essay B completely omits any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency in this criterion. Essay A's approach is more scientifically rigorous, thoughtful, and thoroughly documented.",
