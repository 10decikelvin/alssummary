  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong examples of Criterion B, but Essay B is superior due to its greater complexity, depth of theoretical background, and more sophisticated experimental design. Essay A's research question is clear and its methodology is well-described, including commendable pre-testing to refine concentration ranges and timing. Its discussion of variables and safety is thorough. However, the investigation itself\u2014exploring the effect of concentration on reaction rate via gas collection\u2014is a standard and relatively simple kinetics experiment.\n\nEssay B, in contrast, tackles a more ambitious research question: determining the activation energy of a reaction. The background section demonstrates a much deeper understanding of chemical kinetics, correctly explaining the reaction mechanism, deriving the rate law, and linking it to the Arrhenius equation, which forms the theoretical basis for the entire investigation. The methodology, using a colorimeter to measure absorbance changes, is a more precise and appropriate technique for this type of kinetic study than the manual gas collection in Essay A. Essay B's safety analysis is also slightly more comprehensive, considering the hazards of the product (iodopropanone) as well as the reactants. While both essays identify weaknesses, Essay B's engagement with a more complex topic and its superior integration of advanced chemical theory into its experimental design make it the stronger of the two.",
