  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough approach to Criterion B. The research question is highly focused, and the background information provides a clear theoretical foundation by linking electrolysis principles directly to the experimental variables. The greatest strength of Essay A lies in its meticulous methodology; it presents a detailed, replicable procedure, includes a comprehensive materials list with uncertainties, and critically, details how each controlled variable (surface area, concentration, distance) will be managed. For instance, it specifies, \"a wooden splint placed across the beaker... is marked... to ensure the same distance between the electrodes in each trial,\" showing excellent attention to procedural detail. In contrast, while Essay B has a valid research question for a database investigation, its methodology is comparatively brief, mainly listing data sources without much detail on the data collection or filtering process. The most significant weakness of Essay B is the complete omission of any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a required component of this criterion. Essay A excels here with a dedicated and thoughtful risk assessment, discussing chemical hazards like H\u2082SO\u2084 and responsible disposal methods for CuSO\u2084. Therefore, Essay A's comprehensive experimental design and complete risk assessment make it clearly superior in demonstrating the qualities of exploration.",
