  "reasoning": "Both submissions are excellent and demonstrate a strong understanding of the scientific process, meeting the criteria for the top mark band in Exploration. Both have clear, focused research questions, well-structured methodologies, and thorough considerations for variables and safety.\n\nHowever, Essay A has a slight edge for a few reasons. The background information in Essay A is more comprehensive, providing a detailed explanation of the underlying chemical principles, including the reaction mechanism and the Arrhenius equation. This demonstrates a deeper theoretical understanding that directly supports the experimental design. Furthermore, the \"Preliminary Testing\" section in Essay A is more detailed and showcases a more robust process of methodological refinement, justifying choices like the temperature range and the decision to omit cuvette caps. This shows a higher degree of personal engagement and critical thinking in the design phase.\n\nEssay B is also very strong, with a well-justified research question linked to a real-world application (anemia) and a thorough, replicable procedure. Its discussion on safety and waste disposal is slightly more specific than Essay A's. However, the theoretical depth and the detailed account of preliminary work give Essay A a minor advantage in demonstrating a more complete and well-thought-out investigation from conception to execution.",
