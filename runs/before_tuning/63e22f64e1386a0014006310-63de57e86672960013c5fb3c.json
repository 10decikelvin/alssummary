  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a very high level of quality for Criterion B, making this a close comparison. Essay A presents a well-structured investigation with a complex, two-part research question that explores both a homologous series trend and isomerism. Its background information is clear, and the table of controlled variables is excellent, not only listing the variables but also justifying why they must be controlled and how this will be achieved. However, its safety and environmental considerations are adequate but somewhat brief, focusing primarily on immediate lab safety.\n\nEssay B, while having a more straightforward research question, excels in its depth of planning and contextualization. The personal engagement is strong, and the background research is outstanding, incorporating findings from multiple previous studies to inform its hypothesis and methodology. The justification for the selected range of the independent variable (\"2 to 10 volts was chosen... their advice will be explored but also challenged\") shows a high degree of critical thought. The methodology is meticulously detailed, and the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are exceptionally thorough, discussing specific chemical hazards, mindful consumption, and correct disposal procedures for harmful substances like sulfuric acid and copper sulfate. This comprehensive approach to risk and impact assessment gives it a distinct advantage. While Essay A's plan is very good, Essay B's methodology feels more rigorously researched and its consideration of the broader implications of the experiment is superior.",
