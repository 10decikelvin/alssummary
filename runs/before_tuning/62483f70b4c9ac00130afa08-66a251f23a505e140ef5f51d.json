  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of proficiency in Criterion B, but Essay B is marginally superior due to its exceptional methodological rigor and depth of theoretical background. Essay B's research question, while standard, is supported by a sophisticated theoretical framework linking the equilibrium constant to Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation. A key strength is its detailed \"Preliminary experiments\" section, which showcases authentic scientific inquiry by identifying a problem (reactant absorbance), proposing a solution (adding nitric acid), and justifying the choice by considering potential side reactions. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is impeccably organized, particularly the table of controlled variables which clearly explains *why* and *how* each variable is controlled, a model of clarity.\n\nEssay A is also excellent, featuring a well-contextualized research question rooted in a contemporary environmental issue, which demonstrates strong personal engagement. The background research effectively compares different analytical techniques (colorimetric, sensor, Winkler method) to justify the chosen methodology, which is a significant strength. However, Essay B's detailed documentation of its iterative experimental design process and its more profound integration of advanced chemical principles give it a slight edge. The safety and environmental considerations in both are thorough, but Essay B's specific link between a potential hazard (cyanide gas formation) and a methodological choice (using a water bath) is another example of its meticulous approach.",
