  "reasoning": "Both essays explain relevant content about the a global topic chosen (homelessness caused by rapid urbanization being due to rural-urban migration). Both essays are clearly written and organised clearly according to criterion elements. In terms of analysis of sources with reference to specific historical perspectives, both essays use historians within their analysis. The examples are integrated logically and effectively support ideas/arguments raised and justified conclusions made regarding historical interpretation of differing perspectives. For instance, both mention factors driving urbanization (e.t.c unemployment rates and economic opportunities in developed countries) and its consequent challenges like poor living conditions, limited access to essential resources, exploitation and discrimination.  However, both essays lack in the critical analysis aspect. Both essays don't directly explain how the sources have biases and values that the reader/student has taken into account, despite using different sources. Overall though, while essay B\u2019s inclusion of more detail gives a broader context for why the conclusion has been reached, the fact there are more sources mentioned specifically by name as evidence for the arguments presented, suggests a deeper understanding of historical documents. The candidate demonstrated a stronger focus on the economic aspects and social consequences of rapid urbanization in Lagos, presenting a clear and focused analysis of the push--pull factors leading to rural-urban migration. However, the explanation of the implications of these problems is more comprehensively explored in essay A where it cites recent statistical data, enhancing its credibility.",
