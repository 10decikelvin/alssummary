  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to the Exploration criterion. Its research question is highly focused, specifying the exact voltages to be tested. The personal engagement is excellent, providing a compelling and authentic narrative that logically leads to the research question about electroplating. The background information is thorough, correctly identifying the relevant scientific principles, including Faraday's laws of electrolysis, which provides a strong theoretical basis for the hypothesis. In contrast, Essay A's research question is adequate but less specific, and the personal engagement feels more generic and less directly connected to the chosen topic. While Essay A does present relevant background information, it lacks the depth and direct quantitative link to the hypothesis that Essay B establishes. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology section is well-structured with clearly defined variables and a detailed procedure. Essay A's inclusion of an 'Evaluation' and 'Improvements' section within its methodology is structurally incorrect for an IB IA, as this content belongs in the conclusion after the data has been collected and analyzed.",
