  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B is superior due to its significantly greater depth, complexity, and meticulous experimental design. Essay A outlines a very competent database investigation with a clear research question, relevant background on thermochemistry, and a well-controlled methodology by focusing on \"only linear primary alcohols.\" However, its scope is more straightforward, and it lacks a dedicated safety section, which, while less critical for a database study, is still an omission.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B demonstrates a much higher level of chemical understanding and investigative skill. The background section is exemplary, not only explaining the necessary UV-Vis spectrometry and Beer-Lambert law but also delving into advanced concepts like d-orbital splitting via crystal field theory to justify the coloration of the copper(II) complex. The methodology is outstanding, featuring a \"Development and pilot studies\" section that showcases sophisticated problem-solving; for instance, identifying precipitate formation and implementing a micelle-based solution is a mark of a top-tier investigation. Furthermore, Essay B includes an exhaustive list of controlled variables and a comprehensive, specific safety, ethical, and environmental section that addresses chemical and physical hazards appropriately. While Essay A is a solid investigation, Essay B's ambition, demonstrated chemical insight, and rigorous methodological refinement make it the clearly stronger submission for Criterion B.",
