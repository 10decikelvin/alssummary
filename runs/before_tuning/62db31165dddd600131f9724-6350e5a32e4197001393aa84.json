  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B as it presents a more complete and thorough fulfillment of the requirements for Criterion B, despite having a less focused research question and weaker background theory compared to Essay A. Essay A's primary strength is its excellent background section, which clearly establishes the scientific context for the degradation of ascorbic acid and justifies the chosen titration methodology using relevant chemical principles like collision theory. Its research question is also focused and appropriate. However, Essay A is critically incomplete; it entirely lacks a methodology, a detailed variables section, and any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations. These omissions are disqualifying for a high score in the Exploration criterion, which assesses the entire experimental plan.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B provides a comprehensive submission covering all aspects of Criterion B. It includes a detailed, step-by-step methodology for two different techniques, a clearly defined list of variables with justifications, and a robust section on safety and environmental considerations. The main weakness of Essay B lies in its convoluted research question, which attempts to investigate both salinity and different water sources simultaneously, and a background section that fails to explain the core scientific principle of why salinity affects dissolved oxygen levels. However, its procedural completeness demonstrates a full consideration of the experimental design process from start to finish. Therefore, while Essay A shows a deeper theoretical understanding in its written sections, Essay B provides a complete, workable (if flawed) experimental plan, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B overall.",
