  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more thorough and well-developed plan for investigation, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\n1.  **Research Question & Rationale:** Essay A's research question is highly specific, clearly defining the independent variable (pH), dependent variable (mass of iron(II) extracted), and the exact method (titration). The background information provides a clear scientific rationale for the investigation, linking the solubility of iron salts to pH and explaining the principles of redox titration. Essay B's research question is effectively two questions, which slightly reduces its focus. While the topic is sound, the justification in the introduction feels more like general curiosity rather than being based on specific chemical principles.\n\n2.  **Methodology & Control:** Essay A's methodology is more rigorous. It includes a detailed table of apparatus with their specific uncertainties, which is crucial for later data processing and error analysis. The justification for the chosen pH range is excellent, as it references both real-world applications (drink acidity) and preliminary experimental findings that led to a modification of the range. Essay B provides a solid procedure, but it omits apparatus uncertainties entirely, which is a significant oversight. Its controlled variables are appropriate, but the level of detail and justification does not match Essay A.\n\n3.  **Scientific Depth:** Essay A demonstrates a higher level of understanding by including a preliminary calculation to justify the concentration of the KMnO\u2084 solution. This shows foresight and a deeper engagement with the stoichiometry of the reaction. Essay B's background is correct but more descriptive and less analytical.\n\n4.  **Safety, Ethical, and Environmental Considerations:** Both essays address safety well. However, Essay A explicitly addresses all three components required by the IB rubric: safety (glassware, chemicals), ethical (minimizing waste), and environmental (proper disposal of KMnO\u2084), even citing sources for disposal procedures. Essay B focuses almost exclusively on safety, neglecting the ethical and environmental aspects.\n\nIn summary, while both essays outline viable investigations, Essay A demonstrates superior planning, attention to detail, scientific justification, and a more complete consideration of all aspects of the Exploration criterion.",
