  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of quality in its exploration. The research question is exceptionally well-formulated, specifying the exact ratios to be tested and the system under investigation. The background section is comprehensive and sophisticated, not only explaining the fundamental principles of buffers and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation but also justifying the shift from a biological buffer system to a more feasible lab-based one, which shows excellent critical thinking. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is robust, clearly justified by citing a university-level experiment, and employs modern data acquisition tools like a pH probe and drop counter for high precision. The table of controlled variables is exemplary, detailing not just what is controlled, but why and how.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B presents a competent but less rigorous exploration. While its research question and rationale are clear and personally motivated, the methodology contains a significant flaw. The procedure involves heating the juice to a specific temperature and *then* removing it from the heat source to perform the titration. This means the temperature, the key independent variable, is not maintained during the measurement process, which fundamentally undermines the validity of the investigation. While Essay B does a good job with its background information and its consideration of safety and ethics, this critical oversight in experimental design makes it weaker. Essay A's exploration is more thorough, scientifically sound, and demonstrates a deeper engagement with the chemical principles involved.",
