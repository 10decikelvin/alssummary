  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially stronger in its fulfillment of Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused, specific, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the scope of a scientific investigation: \"What is the pseudo order of reaction with respect to Methyl Orange and order of reaction with respect to H2O2 in the degradation of Methyl Orange, in the presence of 365nm Ultraviolet Light...\". In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change of the redox between 6grams of zinc and 25 cm\u00b3 of copper (II) sulphate solution?\", is simplistic and based on a flawed premise; with a fixed mass of the limiting reactant (zinc), the total enthalpy change should theoretically remain constant.\n\nEssay A's background is detailed, scientifically rich, and directly relevant, citing literature to explain complex concepts like the Photo-Fenton reaction, the scavenging effect of H2O2, and the Beer-Lambert Law, all of which justify the methodological choices. Essay B's background confuses kinetics (collision theory) with thermodynamics (enthalpy change) and its rationale is generic. Methodologically, Essay A is exemplary, using five variations of the independent variable, providing strong justifications for controlled variables, and crucially, detailing preliminary trials that led to the refinement of the procedure. Essay B's methodology is a standard textbook procedure with only two data points for the independent variable, which is insufficient to explore a relationship. Finally, Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are specific and well-integrated, whereas Essay B's are more generic.\n\nOverall, Essay A presents a sophisticated, well-researched, and methodologically robust exploration that is far superior to the scientifically flawed and simplistic investigation presented in Essay B.",
