  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and scientifically rigorous exploration. Its research question is highly specific and well-defined, clearly outlining the independent variable (five distinct HCl concentrations), the dependent variable (rate of reaction measured by CO\u2082 volume), and key controlled parameters like the mass of the antacid and the time frame. The background information in Essay B is also superior, as it not only covers the basic neutralisation chemistry but delves deeper into reaction kinetics, collision theory, and the formation of the carbonic acid intermediate, providing a much stronger theoretical foundation for the investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology section is exemplary. The detailed table of controlled variables, which includes not just what is being controlled but also *why* and *how* it is controlled, shows a sophisticated understanding of experimental design. The inclusion of a \"Pre-test\" section is a hallmark of a high-quality exploration, as it shows the student actively refined their procedure based on preliminary findings to ensure meaningful data could be collected. In contrast, Essay A has a good RQ and adequate background, but its methodological control is weaker; for instance, the decision to not control the mass of the tablet, while justified from a \"real-world\" perspective, makes for a less controlled scientific comparison.\n\nFinally, the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations in Essay B are far more comprehensive. The use of a detailed table with hazard symbols, specific precautions, and emergency actions for each chemical demonstrates a much higher level of engagement with safety protocols compared to the more general statements in Essay A. While Essay A presents a competent and clear exploration, Essay B's depth of research, meticulous planning, and sophisticated approach to experimental design make it the clear winner for Criterion B.",
