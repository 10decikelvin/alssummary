  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more scientifically sound and well-considered exploration, making it the superior submission for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is clear, focused, and outlines a valid scientific inquiry. The background information directly supports the chosen methodologies (Winkler method and oxygen probe), and the safety and environmental considerations are specific and thorough, identifying particular chemicals like \"Sulphuric acid\" and their proper disposal. While Essay A's methodology could be more specific about the exact salt concentrations used, its overall design is logical.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is fundamentally flawed due to a critical conceptual error regarding the limiting reactant. The student claims, \"I used Zinc as the limiting reactant,\" but simple stoichiometric calculations show that for both 0.5M and 1.0M solutions of 25 cm\u00b3 of CuSO\u2084, the copper (II) sulphate is the limiting reactant, not the 6g of zinc. This misunderstanding invalidates the research question's premise, as the experiment is not actually investigating the effect of concentration on enthalpy change under constant reacting moles, but rather the effect of changing the amount of the limiting reactant. Furthermore, its background inappropriately uses collision theory (which relates to reaction rate) to explain enthalpy change (a thermodynamic quantity). Finally, the safety section in Essay B is brief and provides questionable advice, such as disposing of copper (II) sulphate \"down the drain,\" which is environmentally irresponsible. Although Essay B shows some strong theoretical knowledge by calculating cell potential and Gibbs free energy, its core experimental design is based on a significant chemical misunderstanding, making Essay A the clear winner.",
