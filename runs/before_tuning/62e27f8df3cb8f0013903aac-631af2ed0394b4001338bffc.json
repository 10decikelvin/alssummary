  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong \"Exploration\" sections, but Essay A is superior due to its more rigorous and self-contained experimental design. Essay A's research question is exceptionally well-focused, specifying all key parameters of the investigation. Its methodology is strengthened significantly by a dedicated \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which demonstrates a thoughtful, iterative approach to developing the procedure, such as adjusting the temperature range and reagent mixing technique based on initial observations. This level of refinement shows a deeper engagement with the practical aspects of the investigation. The variables in Essay A are meticulously identified, and the justifications for how they are controlled are clear and directly linked to ensuring valid results.\n\nEssay B is also excellent, featuring an impressive and well-researched background section that cites scientific literature. Its research question is clear and the scope is well-defined. However, its methodology relies on manufacturer-provided data for the independent variables (protein and fat content) rather than direct measurement, which slightly weakens the experimental control. Furthermore, it makes a significant assumption about the calcium-to-magnesium ratio across all milk types based on a value for cow's milk, a potential source of systematic error. While both essays have thorough safety considerations, Essay A's robust and refined experimental design, justified by preliminary work, demonstrates a more complete and scientifically sound exploration.",
