  "reasoning": "The decision is that Essay A is substantially better than Essay B.\n\nEssay A presents a highly sophisticated and well-designed investigation into a complex chemical phenomenon. Its research question is focused, appropriate, and investigates a clear relationship between a single independent variable (temperature) and well-defined dependent variables (oscillation characteristics). A key strength of Essay A is the \"Choice of Materials and Method\" section, which details a thoughtful, iterative process of selecting the best measurement technique, moving from subjective observation to a colorimeter, and finally to a lux sensor. This demonstrates authentic personal engagement and a strong understanding of experimental design. Furthermore, the background information is comprehensive, linking the BZ reaction not only to core chemical principles like kinetics and redox but also to real-world applications like cardiac arrhythmia, which provides excellent context. The identification and control of variables are meticulous, presented in a clear table with robust justifications and methods of control.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating a good grasp of the theoretical chemistry behind Winkler's titration, is built upon a fundamentally flawed research question: \"How does varying salinity (...) and temperature (...) affect the amount of dissolved oxygen...?\". A standard IB investigation should explore the effect of a single independent variable on a dependent variable. By including two independent variables, the experimental design is unfocused and ambiguous from the outset, which is a critical error in exploration. While the essay attempts to separate them in the variables table, the research question itself is poorly formulated. Although Essay B has strengths, such as justifying the choice of Winkler's titration over other methods and providing a solid chemical explanation for its hypotheses, these cannot compensate for the core design flaw.\n\nIn summary, Essay A demonstrates superior experimental design, a deeper level of personal engagement in developing the methodology, and a more sophisticated and focused scope. Essay B's foundational error in its research question significantly undermines the quality of its exploration, making Essay A the clear winner.",
