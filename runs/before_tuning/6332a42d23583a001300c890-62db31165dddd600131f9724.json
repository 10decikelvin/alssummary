  "reasoning": "Essay A is decisively better as it presents a complete and highly detailed exploration, fully meeting the demands of Criterion B. Its research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction... Determination of the activation energy,\" is specific, focused, and sets a high-achieving goal. The background information expertly connects collision theory and the Arrhenius equation to the experimental design. The methodology is exceptionally thorough, providing a replicable procedure that includes precise solution preparation calculations (e.g., \"31.52 g of oxalic acid... considering the purity of the compound... 0.81 g\"), a clear list of variables with uncertainties, and a robust safety table that addresses chemical hazards and proper waste disposal.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B is critically incomplete. While its background information on ascorbic acid and its research question are appropriate and demonstrate good context, the essay fails to provide the core components of the exploration. The \"Variables\" section is presented as an empty table, and there is no methodology section at all, meaning the materials list, experimental procedure, and safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are entirely absent. Without a methodology, it is impossible to assess the appropriateness of the experimental design, the control of variables, or the attention to safety. Therefore, while Essay B has a solid theoretical foundation, Essay A's comprehensive and meticulously planned investigation makes it far superior.",
