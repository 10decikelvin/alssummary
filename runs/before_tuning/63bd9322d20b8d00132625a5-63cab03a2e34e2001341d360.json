  "reasoning": "The provided text for both submissions are excerpts from larger lab reports, making a full comparison challenging. However, based on the provided text, Essay B is stronger. The methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, providing a step-by-step account of both the sample preparation and the titration process. This allows for clear understanding and replication of the experiment. The inclusion of a dedicated 'Assumptions' section is a sophisticated touch, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the experimental limitations beyond just procedural errors. While Essay A also provides a table of errors and improvements, the descriptions are somewhat brief. For example, stating 'Use a draught shield' is less specific than describing the controlled environment of an insulated box as in Essay B. Furthermore, the introduction of Essay B effectively establishes the real-world context and importance of measuring dissolved oxygen, making the research question feel more significant. In contrast, Essay A lacks a similar introduction in the provided excerpt. Both have good structure using tables to convey information. While both submissions have merits, Essay B's superior detail in methodology and its thoughtful inclusion of underlying assumptions make it the better piece of work.",
