  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better as it demonstrates a much higher level of personal engagement, scientific understanding, and methodological rigor required for Criterion B. The research question in Essay A is highly focused and justified by a thorough rationale, including a sophisticated understanding of why the specific acidic pH range was chosen to avoid the precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide. Essay A's background section provides a detailed chemical explanation of the biosorption mechanism, linking the functional groups in orange peels to chelation and ion exchange, and lucidly explaining the effect of pH using Le Chatelier's Principle. In contrast, Essay B's research question is less focused, and its background information fails to provide any scientific explanation for its central phenomenon\u2014why increasing salinity affects dissolved oxygen.\n\nMethodologically, Essay A excels with its well-considered variables table that explains the significance of each control, and a procedure refined through detailed preliminary trials. For example, Essay A explains, \"On attempting pH 6.0 as my first set of values, I realised that most of the copper had precipitated... Hence, I decided to set pH 5.0 as my highest variation.\" This demonstrates genuine exploration. Essay B's methodology has a fundamental design flaw by using \"different water sources\" (river, stream, lake), which introduces a massive uncontrolled variable, making it impossible to isolate the effect of the independent variable (NaCl concentration).\n\nFinally, Essay A's evaluation is critical and insightful, identifying subtle systematic errors like a potential shift in \u03bbmax with pH and explaining how other issues, like pigments from the peels, were actively mitigated. Essay B's evaluation is superficial, listing generic errors like \"Error of parallax\" while failing to recognize the critical flaw in its experimental design concerning the different water sources. Overall, Essay A presents a thoughtful, well-executed scientific investigation, whereas Essay B presents a poorly designed experiment with a superficial understanding of the underlying principles.",
