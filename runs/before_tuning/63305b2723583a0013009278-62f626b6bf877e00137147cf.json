  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much more thorough and well-structured experimental plan. Its research question is clear, focused, and directly addresses the variables being investigated: 'How does the voltage... affect the mass of zinc deposited...?' In contrast, Essay B's question is awkwardly phrased and includes the methodology within the question itself. The background information in Essay A is comprehensive, linking fundamental electrochemical principles and Faraday's laws directly to the experiment, and even provides real-world context. Essay B's introduction is minimal and lacks sufficient theoretical underpinning. Most critically, the methodology section in Essay A is detailed, replicable, and includes a robust table of controlled variables with clear explanations of how they will be managed. Essay B's methodology is incomplete, missing key details like sample volumes and how solutions are prepared, and fails to mention any controlled variables. While both address safety, Essay A's approach is more systematic. Finally, Essay A includes a well-reasoned, quantitative hypothesis based on its background research, a feature entirely absent from Essay B.",
