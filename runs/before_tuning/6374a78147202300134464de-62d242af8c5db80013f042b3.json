  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the temperature at which raisin and dates flavoured milk with almond is heated at... affect its calcium content... by using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexometric titration?\", is highly focused, complex, and shows personal engagement. The background information provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the complex chemistry involved, including chelation with EDTA and the principles of a back titration. The methodology is exceptionally thorough, outlining not just the procedure but also the preparation of standard solutions, a justification for the chosen method over alternatives (FAAS, ISE-CT), and a proactive and insightful analysis of limitations and potential improvements. This demonstrates a deep engagement with the practical aspects of the investigation. The identification and control of numerous variables are meticulous and well-justified.\n\nEssay A, while based on a classic thermochemistry experiment, contains a major conceptual flaw. The student incorrectly identifies zinc as the limiting reactant when simple stoichiometric calculations show it is the copper (II) sulphate solution. This error undermines the entire premise of varying the CuSO\u2084 concentration to see an effect. Furthermore, the background confuses the concept of reaction rate (collision theory) with enthalpy change, stating that higher concentration causes \"faster production of heat\" as an explanation for a change in enthalpy, which is incorrect. While the procedure is generally sound and safety is addressed, these fundamental errors in understanding and experimental design make it substantially weaker than Essay B. Essay B's minor inconsistencies (e.g., mismatching temperature values between the RQ and the variables table) are insignificant compared to the core conceptual flaws in Essay A.",
