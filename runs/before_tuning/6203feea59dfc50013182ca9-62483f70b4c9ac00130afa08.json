  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a superior exploration (Criterion B) due to its well-defined research question and exceptionally structured experimental design. The research question, \"How does pH of a water sample affect its biological oxygen demand over a course of 5 days, as found using the Winkler method?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a direct, testable relationship between specific variables. The methodology is detailed and replicable, and the variables section is exemplary, using a table to clearly delineate the independent, dependent, and controlled variables, along with precise methods for their control.\n\nEssay B, while containing a strong background section that thoughtfully contextualizes the investigation within global warming, is built upon a weaker research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...?\" This question is evaluative rather than investigatory, and its success hinges on comparing experimental results to \"predicted values,\" yet the methodology fails to specify the source or calculation of these crucial reference values. While its safety and environmental considerations are slightly more specific than Essay A's, this does not compensate for the less focused research question and the critical omission in its methodology. Essay A's variables section, in particular, demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental control.\n\nUltimately, Essay A outlines a more scientifically rigorous and complete investigation. Its clear structure, focused research question, and meticulous attention to variables make it a better example of Criterion B. Essay B's exploration is conceptually interesting but less well-executed in its planning stages.",
