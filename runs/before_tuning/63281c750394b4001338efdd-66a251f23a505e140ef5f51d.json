  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly more thorough and sophisticated approach to Criterion B. Its research question is highly specific, and the background information provides a deep theoretical context, expertly linking the equilibrium constant (Kc) to fundamental thermodynamic principles like Gibbs Free Energy and the Van't Hoff equation. This provides a robust quantitative framework for the investigation, which is superior to the more descriptive background in Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is exemplary; the inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" shows a process of refinement and troubleshooting, which is a hallmark of a strong scientific exploration. The table of controlled variables in Essay B is outstanding, not only listing the variables but also justifying why they must be controlled and detailing how this will be achieved. In contrast, Essay A's methodology contains a significant flaw: it plans to calculate heat energy based on the rated power of the immersion heater (`E=Pt`) rather than measuring the actual voltage and current, which introduces a major source of systematic error. While Essay A's research question is clear and its procedure is logical, it lacks the depth, rigor, and meticulous planning evident in Essay B. Finally, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are far more detailed and specific to the chemicals used, demonstrating a much greater awareness of laboratory risks compared to the generic precautions listed in Essay A.",
