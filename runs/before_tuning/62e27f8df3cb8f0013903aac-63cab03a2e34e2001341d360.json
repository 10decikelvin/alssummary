  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a much stronger and more focused investigation. Its research question is exemplary: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...\" It is specific, measurable, and outlines a clear scientific goal. In contrast, Essay B's research question, \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level...,\" is weak because \"pollution level\" is a qualitative, poorly defined independent variable. Essay A further excels in its detailed tables for variables, providing clear justification for why each is controlled and how, which is a hallmark of a well-planned investigation. Essay B simply lists its variables with minimal explanation. Furthermore, Essay A's inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section demonstrates a crucial aspect of the scientific process: refining a method based on trial and error, which shows high levels of personal engagement and critical thinking. While Essay B provides a detailed methodology for the Winkler titration, it lacks this element of independent design refinement. Finally, Essay A's background information is concise and directly supports the Arrhenius plot calculation, whereas Essay B's background is more general and less connected to the specific experimental design.",
