  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is as follows:\n\nEssay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of scientific exploration and contextual understanding, which are central to Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is highly focused, well-phrased, and seeks to establish a complex quantitative relationship. The background information is exceptional; it cites scientific literature to identify a genuine gap in knowledge and provides a detailed, sophisticated explanation of the underlying chemistry, including casein micelles, Lewis acid-base theory in protein complexes, and chemical equilibria. This provides a very strong and compelling justification for the investigation.\n\nEssay A's research question is functional but less refined, reading more like a statement of procedure: \"Investigating effect of heating on oil...by determining Acid value and saponification value...\". While its methodology is very thorough, including a preliminary experiment and a dedicated justification section, the background information is comparatively superficial. Crucially, it admits a lack of understanding regarding one of its dependent variables, stating, \"Effect of increasing temperature on Saponification Value (SV) cannot be hypothesized due to lack of availability of research,\" which highlights a weakness in the exploratory phase.\n\nBoth essays feature excellent, detailed procedures and comprehensive considerations for variables and safety. However, Essay B's superior scientific grounding, its more nuanced research question, and its clear positioning of the experiment within the context of existing scientific research make its exploration more impressive. Essay A presents a well-planned but more standard investigation, whereas Essay B's exploration feels more authentic, personally engaged, and scientifically rigorous.",
