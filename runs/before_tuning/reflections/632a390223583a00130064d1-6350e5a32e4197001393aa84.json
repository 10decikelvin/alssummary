  "grading_context": "The IB marker's qualitative assessment clearly favored Essay A, primarily due to its exceptional clarity, precision, and thoroughness in adhering to Criterion B requirements. The marker was looking for a highly focused research question, comprehensive and relevant background information, a meticulously designed and appropriate methodology, and a complete awareness of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations.\n\nFor Essay A, the marker specifically lauded its \"well-focused and detailed description of the main topic\" and a research question that was \"clearly stated without any errors.\" The background information was praised for being \"relevant and focused\" and the chemistry \"explained well enough for the reader to fully and easily understand it.\" Crucially, the methodology was deemed \"highly appropriate and focused on answering the research question,\" with a key commendation for being \"adapted from a scientific publication,\" which inherently suggests a higher level of scientific rigor and planning. The inclusion of \"appropriate steps to assure the relevancy and validity of the obtained results,\" specifically referring to the identification and control of variables, further elevated Essay A's quality. Full awareness of safety, ethical, and environmental issues rounded out its strong performance.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while generally competent, exhibited qualitative shortcomings that positioned it below Essay A. The marker noted that its research question, though present, \"lacks detail.\" This implies a need for greater specificity or a clearer delineation of the scope of the investigation. The background information, while \"well-written and organized,\" was identified as an area where the student \"could expand more on the theoretical effect of salinity on the oxygen concentrations in water,\" indicating a gap in the depth of theoretical understanding directly pertinent to the research question. Methodologically, while the Winkler method was deemed \"highly appropriate,\" the marker suggested improvement by \"listing the concentrations of salt that will be used in the experiment,\" pointing to an incomplete specification of the independent variable, which is a fundamental aspect of experimental design. These specific qualitative differences in precision, detail, and theoretical depth were the primary drivers in the marker's decision to assess Essay A as having better Criterion B quality.",
  "essay_quality_analysis": "**Essay A: Young's Modulus of Starch-Based Bioplastic**\nEssay A exhibits strong adherence to Criterion B, demonstrating a high level of planning and theoretical understanding. Its research question is exceptionally well-articulated and focused: \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% & 100%) affect the Young’s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\". This question clearly defines a single independent variable (specific concentrations of sodium bicarbonate) and a single dependent variable (Young's Modulus), allowing for a precise investigation.\n\nThe background information is comprehensive, explaining fundamental concepts of plastics, bioplastics, plasticizers (with specific examples like glycerol), and the theoretical basis of Young's Modulus, including the necessary equations (Equations 1, 2, 3) and units. The molecular structures of cornstarch, glycerol, and sodium bicarbonate are included, enhancing the chemical explanation. The methodological planning is a major strength. The \"Variables\" section is outstanding, featuring a detailed table of controlled variables that not only lists each variable but also meticulously explains the \"Method of Control\" and the \"Possible Effect on Results\" if not controlled. This level of foresight demonstrates a deep understanding of experimental validity. The procedure is highly detailed, adapted from a scientific publication, and incorporates modern technology like the Vernier LabQuest 2 and Tracker software for accurate force and deformation measurements, specifying their uncertainties. This meticulous approach minimizes random and systematic errors. The safety, environmental, and ethical considerations are also thoroughly addressed, with a particularly thoughtful reflection on the ethical implications of using edible materials.\n\n**Essay B: Investigating the effect of Sodium Chloride in concentration of Dissolved Oxygen.**\nEssay B, while demonstrating a foundational understanding of Criterion B, has several identifiable weaknesses that reduce its overall quality compared to Essay A. The research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm³ of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is multi-faceted. It attempts to investigate the effect of salt concentration, compare results across \"different water sources,\" and implicitly aims to compare two different measurement methods (Winkler vs. Oxygen probe) simultaneously. This breadth dilutes the focus and introduces additional uncontrolled variables or complex comparisons, which the ground truth noted as \"lacking detail.\"\n\nThe background information, while explaining Dissolved Oxygen, factors affecting it, the Winkler method (with chemical equations), and salinity, was identified by the marker as needing expansion \"on the theoretical effect of salinity on the oxygen concentrations in water.\" This omission of a key theoretical link directly relevant to the independent variable is a significant gap in the preliminary research. Methodologically, while the use of the Winkler method and an oxygen probe is appropriate, a crucial weakness lies in the imprecise specification of the independent variable. The essay states, \"The concentration of the salt will be changed for the different trials,\" but it fails to list the *specific concentrations* or masses of NaCl to be used, only mentioning \"Weigh 1.2g of NaCl.\" This lack of detail makes the experiment less replicable and less focused. The controlled variables table is less comprehensive than Essay A's, lacking explanations of *how* each variable is controlled or its potential impact. While safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are addressed, they are more standard and less critically reflective than those presented in Essay A. The \"Weaknesses\" and \"Limitations\" sections in Essay B's evaluation are quite extensive, revealing many potential sources of error and practical challenges, further suggesting issues in the initial experimental design.",
  "what_went_well": [
    "*   The LLM correctly identified the superior focus and detail of Essay A's research question in the forward comparison. It accurately highlighted that Essay A's question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate... affect the Young’s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", clearly defines the independent and dependent variables, making it precise and well-suited for a scientific investigation. This aligns perfectly with the ground truth's praise for Essay A's \"clearly stated without any errors\" research question and the implied criticism of Essay B's multi-faceted, less detailed question. *   In the forward comparison, the LLM commendably recognized the comprehensive and meticulous nature of Essay A's methodology and variable control. It specifically noted the \"comprehensive table of controlled variables that not only lists the variables but also explains the precise method of control and the potential impact on results if not controlled.\" This level of detail in experimental design, which the ground truth marker specifically rewarded, demonstrates the LLM's ability to discern high-quality planning for relevancy and validity in an investigation. *   The LLM accurately distinguished the depth of critical thinking in Essay A's risk assessment, particularly highlighting the ethical considerations. In the forward comparison, it stated that Essay A's risk assessment was \"more insightful, addressing not only standard laboratory safety but also the nuanced ethical consideration of using food materials for an experiment.\" This appreciation for a broader and more thoughtful approach to safety, ethical, and environmental issues aligns directly with the ground truth feedback, which specifically noted Essay A's \"full awareness\" of these concerns, including its thoughtful discussion of edible materials."

    "*   **Improve Consistency and Implement Bidirectionality Checks**: The most significant area for improvement is the LLM's profound inconsistency, producing contradictory decisions (A>B in forward, B>A in backward) for the same pair of essays. This indicates a lack of a stable, consistent internal evaluation mechanism. To fix this, the LLM should be trained to perform an internal consistency check or a \"bidirectional review.\" After generating one comparison (A vs B), it should generate the second (B vs A) and then reconcile any discrepancies. If the conclusions are opposite, it should trigger a deeper, re-evaluation phase, comparing the stated reasons from both perspectives against the core criteria to arrive at a single, consistent judgment. This would prevent situations where valid points are made in one comparison but completely overlooked or reversed in another. *   **Enhance Specificity and Accuracy in Identifying Independent Variable Details**: In the backward comparison, the LLM made a critical factual error by stating that Essay A \"doesn't specify the exact salt concentrations to be tested\" and that \"Essay A's methodology is less precise.\" This is incorrect; Essay A clearly lists specific Sodium Bicarbonate concentrations (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, & 100%). It was *Essay B* that failed to specify the exact salt (NaCl) concentrations, which the ground truth implicitly highlighted by suggesting improvement in \"listing the concentrations of salt that will be used.\" The LLM needs to improve its ability to accurately extract and cross-reference numerical and categorical details of independent variables from the essay content. This can be achieved by explicitly prompting it to identify *all* quantitative and qualitative specifications of the independent variable in *both* essays before making comparisons, ensuring it grounds its claims in precise textual evidence. *   **Deepen Evaluation of Research Question Focus and Scope**: The LLM's backward comparison praised Essay B's research question as \"focused, specific, and clearly testable,\" directly contradicting the ground truth's assessment that it \"lacks detail.\" Furthermore, while the forward comparison correctly identified Essay B's RQ as less focused, the backward comparison's description of Essay A's RQ as \"convoluted, attempting to simultaneously investigate...\" was also a mischaracterization of Essay A's very specific question. The LLM needs a more refined understanding of what constitutes a \"focused\" and \"detailed\" research question, especially when multiple sub-investigations (e.g., different water sources, different measurement methods) are proposed within a single question. It should be explicitly trained to identify when a research question is trying to cover too much ground or when it lacks specific parameters for the independent variable, which directly impacts the feasibility and clarity of the exploration. *   **Improve Assessment of Theoretical Background Depth and Relevance**: The backward comparison incorrectly claimed that Essay A's background \"fails to deeply explain the chemical principles,\" which again contradicts the ground truth's positive evaluation of Essay A's chemical explanations. Conversely, the ground truth noted that Essay B \"could expand more on the theoretical effect of salinity on the oxygen concentrations in water,\" indicating a relevant theoretical gap that the backward comparison did not explicitly penalize. The LLM needs to be better at evaluating if the theoretical background *sufficiently* explains the underlying scientific principles relevant to the specific research question and independent variable. This means not just checking if information is present, but assessing its depth, clarity, and direct relevance to the proposed investigation, especially identifying any missing conceptual links."
