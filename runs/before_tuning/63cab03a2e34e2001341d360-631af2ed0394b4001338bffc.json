  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of achievement for Criterion B. The research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow's, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is exceptionally clear, focused, and scientifically rigorous. This question is supported by an in-depth, well-referenced background section that explores the complex chemistry of milk, including protein-mineral complexation and chemical equilibria, thereby establishing a strong scientific context and a clear rationale for the investigation. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is exemplary; it not only identifies and justifies the control of key variables in a detailed table but also astutely discusses uncontrolled variables, showing a sophisticated understanding of experimental design.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is undermined by a poorly constructed research question: \"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water, depending on their pollution level by comparing secondary data of 4 water bodies, by using Winkler\u2019s method?\". This question is confusing as it mentions using \"secondary data\" while the methodology clearly describes a primary data collection experiment. The independent variable, \"pollution level,\" is not quantitatively defined but is instead based on qualitative observations, which weakens the entire premise of the investigation. While Essay A's methodology (Winkler titration with standardization) is chemically sound and its risk assessment is detailed, these strengths cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in its core research question and the justification of its variables.\n\nEssay B's methodology is also highly appropriate and well-explained, incorporating crucial controls like a buffer solution to maintain pH, which is critical for the complexometric titration. The safety, environmental, and ethical considerations in Essay B are well-structured and thorough. Ultimately, Essay B presents a cohesive, scientifically mature, and thoughtfully designed exploration that is far superior to the less focused and conceptually weaker approach taken in Essay A.",
