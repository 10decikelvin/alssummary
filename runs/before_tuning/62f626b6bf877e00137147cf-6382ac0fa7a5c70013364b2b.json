  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards, which focus on the quality of the exploration.\n\nEssay B is demonstrably superior across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"What is the mass of calcium carbonate in three different sources: chalk, rangoli powder, and seashells, as determined by two different methodologies: back titration and thermal decomposition?\", is clear, focused, and sets up a sophisticated comparative investigation. The background information is outstanding, providing not only the relevant chemical principles (including balanced equations) but also strong personal context and a connection to real-world environmental issues, which thoroughly establishes the scientific context. Furthermore, Essay B features an exemplary variables section, presented in a clear table that not only identifies the independent, dependent, and controlled variables for *both* methodologies but also provides a sound justification for controlling each one. The methodology itself is detailed, well-structured, and replicable, and the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are specific and directly linked to the procedures described.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A is significantly weaker. The research question is awkwardly phrased, and the background section is almost non-existent, offering only a single, generic sentence about titration. This fails to establish any scientific context for the investigation of calcium in milk. A major deficiency is the complete omission of a section identifying and explaining the independent, dependent, and controlled variables. The methodology provided is vague and critically incomplete, as it fails to explain how the independent variable (the expiration date) will be tested or manipulated. While Essay A does include a risk assessment, it is less detailed and integrated than that of Essay B.\n\nIn summary, Essay B presents a well-planned, scientifically grounded, and thoroughly considered investigation that fully meets the requirements of Criterion B. Essay A lacks the necessary detail, scientific context, and methodological rigor expected for a high-quality exploration.",
