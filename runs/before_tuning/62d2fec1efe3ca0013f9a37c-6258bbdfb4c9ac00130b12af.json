  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior to Essay B in its demonstration of the skills required for the Exploration criterion. The research question in Essay A, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is highly focused, specific, and clearly testable. In contrast, Essay B's research question is phrased more as a title and is less concise.\n\nWhile both essays provide relevant background information, Essay A's theoretical framework is more sophisticated and directly linked to its hypothesis. It successfully connects concepts like reaction rates, pKa values (\"HCl has a pKa value of -6.3, while H\u2082SO\u2084 has a pKa value of -3\"), and the Arrhenius equation to build a logical and well-justified prediction. Essay B explains acid and saponification values but struggles to form a complete hypothesis, stating that the effect on saponification value \"cannot be hypothesized due to lack of availability of research,\" which indicates a weakness in background research.\n\nThe methodology in both essays is detailed, but Essay A's is more elegant and appropriate for the scope of a high school investigation. Essay B's procedure is complex, involving two separate titrations and reflux, and contains some confusing terminology, such as using a \"soxhlet apparatus\" for heating oil samples, which is likely an incorrect application of the equipment. Furthermore, Essay A's self-evaluation of its methodology is outstanding. It critically identifies significant limitations, such as the error in not controlling for the diprotic nature of sulfuric acid (\"I could have used 2 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of HCl and 1 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 of H\u2082SO\u2084... the concentrations of H\u207a would have also been equal\") and the high percentage uncertainty from using burettes for small volumes. This level of critical reflection on the procedure itself is more advanced than the more generic evaluation points made in Essay B.\n\nBoth students address safety well, but Essay A\u2019s overall scientific approach\u2014from its focused question and strong theoretical foundation to its insightful evaluation of the methodology\u2014is more indicative of a high-achieving student.",
