  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B content with clear research questions and relevant background information, including correct chemical equations. Essay B, however, demonstrates a more rigorous and scientifically controlled experimental design. Its list of controlled variables is more comprehensive and well-justified, including \"Type and brand of bell pepper,\" \"Temperature Of Water Bath,\" and \"Mass of Bell Pepper Used,\" which shows a deeper consideration for potential confounding factors. In contrast, Essay A makes a conscious choice not to control for the mass of the antacid tablet, justifying it on \"realistic\" grounds, which is a weaker scientific approach as it conflates effectiveness per tablet with effectiveness per gram. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is exceptionally detailed, even including instructions for preparing the starch indicator solution, making it highly replicable. While Essay A's methodology is clear, it relies on a direct titration for poorly soluble solids, a method known to produce indistinct endpoints, a weakness the student even identifies in their evaluation (\"The colour change...was very gradual\"). Essay B's design, despite potential errors in the physical extraction of the vitamin C, is fundamentally more sound and demonstrates a higher level of thought in controlling the experimental environment.",
