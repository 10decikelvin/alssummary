  "reasoning": "Essay B is superior as it demonstrates a much deeper and more sophisticated approach to the scientific process required for Criterion B. The research question in Essay B, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\", is more focused and scientifically ambitious than Essay A's, which seeks to establish a more general relationship. Essay B's background section is exceptionally thorough, linking kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation to build a robust theoretical framework for the experiment. While Essay A's background on Vitamin C is adequate, it lacks the same level of chemical complexity and direct justification for the methodology.\n\nA key strength of Essay B is the detailed section on \"Preliminary Testing,\" which shows a genuine engagement with experimental design and refinement\u2014a hallmark of excellent exploration. The methodology in Essay B is meticulously detailed, and the variable tables are exemplary, not only identifying variables but also justifying their selection and control methods with scientific reasoning. In contrast, Essay A presents a competent but more standard procedure without this evidence of iterative development. Finally, Essay B's safety, environmental, and ethical considerations are far more comprehensive, providing a chemical-specific risk assessment that surpasses the more generic statements in Essay A.",
