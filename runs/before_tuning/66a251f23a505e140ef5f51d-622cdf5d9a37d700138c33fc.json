  "reasoning": "While both essays present strong explorations, Essay A is superior due to its exceptional thoroughness, scientific rigour, and demonstration of personal engagement in the experimental design process. Essay A's inclusion of a \"Preliminary experiments\" section is a significant strength; it shows the student actively problem-solving issues like the inherent color of Fe\u00b3\u207a ions and determining the time required to reach equilibrium. This demonstrates a high level of independent thinking. Furthermore, Essay A's background provides greater theoretical depth by connecting the equilibrium constant not only to Le Chatelier's Principle but also to Gibbs Free Energy and the Van't Hoff equation, providing a strong quantitative framework for the hypothesis. Its table of controlled variables is meticulous, and the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are specific and detailed, identifying non-obvious risks like cyanide gas production and outlining proper disposal methods.\n\nEssay B is commendable for its creativity and personal engagement, tackling a more original and complex topic. The background effectively identifies a gap in existing literature, providing excellent justification for the research. The methodology is also well-detailed and ambitious, showing an intelligent adaptation of a published scientific paper. However, it is significantly weaker in its risk assessment, which is generic and superficial (\"Glassware (Fragile):... handled with high caution\"), and completely omits any environmental or ethical considerations. Although its methodology is complex, Essay A's use of preliminary trials to refine its simpler procedure ultimately demonstrates a more mature and scientific approach to experimental design. Therefore, Essay A's comprehensive and rigorous approach makes it the better example for Criterion B.",
