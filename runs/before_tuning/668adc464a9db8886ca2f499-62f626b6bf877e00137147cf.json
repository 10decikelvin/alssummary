  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach...reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is focused, clear, and establishes measurable independent and dependent variables. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"Using Complexometric Titration will determine how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\", is awkwardly phrased and less precise.\n\nEssay A provides extensive and relevant background information, demonstrating a thorough understanding of kinetics, the Beer-Lambert law, and the underlying redox chemistry, even including the titration method used to determine the initial bleach concentration. Essay B, however, offers almost no background context, failing to discuss complexometric titrations, EDTA, or the chemistry of calcium in milk.\n\nThe methodology in Essay A is detailed, logical, and demonstrates excellent experimental design, including a preliminary test to find the optimal wavelength. The variables are clearly identified and justified, with a comprehensive table for controlled variables explaining their significance and how they were controlled. Essay B's methodology is vague, incomplete, and contains a critical error regarding the indicator color change (\"blue to pink\" instead of the expected wine-red to blue), which calls the entire procedure's validity into question. Furthermore, its variables are not explicitly stated, and the structure is disorganized, mixing materials with risk assessment and uncertainty calculations.\n\nFinally, Essay A's safety and environmental considerations are presented in a clear, systematic table with specific actions for each chemical. While Essay B mentions safety, its approach is more general and less thorough. Overall, Essay A presents a well-planned, scientifically sound, and detailed exploration, whereas Essay B is incomplete, contains significant errors, and lacks the necessary depth and clarity.",
