  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior in its execution of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined and focused: \"What is the effect of changing temperatures (10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 40.00, 50.00\u00b0C) on the equilibrium constant, Kc...\". This precision sets a strong foundation for the entire investigation. Essay A's background section is a major strength, seamlessly integrating high-level concepts like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation to provide a robust theoretical framework. The methodology is meticulous, logically separating the calibration curve preparation from the main experiment, and the inclusion of a \"Preliminary experiments\" section showcases genuine scientific engagement by identifying and solving a problem with reactant absorbance. The treatment of variables in Essay A is exemplary, using a table to clearly explain not just how, but *why* each variable is controlled, linking the control measure back to core chemical principles.\n\nEssay B, while providing good real-world context on dissolved oxygen, is built upon a weaker research question: \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...\". This question is evaluative rather than investigatory, making the scope less focused for a scientific report. While its background on the Winkler method is detailed, its methodology contains a significant flaw, acknowledging that the sample volume was not precisely controlled (\"the bottle usually collected less than this, due to overflow\"), which undermines the accuracy of a titration-based experiment. Its discussion of controlled variables is also far less detailed and justified than Essay A's. Although both essays have strong safety sections, Essay A's overall scientific rigor, from the focused question to the meticulous experimental design and justification of variables, makes it a much stronger example of Criterion B.",
