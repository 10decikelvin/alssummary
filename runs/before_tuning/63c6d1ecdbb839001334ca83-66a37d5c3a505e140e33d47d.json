  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and plausible investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a higher level of scientific rigor, precision, and depth in its experimental design. The background information in Essay A is more thorough, notably including the calculation to justify the concentration of the titrant used, which shows excellent preparation. In contrast, Essay B's background is more general. Essay A's methodology is also superior, specifying the use of precise volumetric equipment like pipettes and volumetric flasks, whereas Essay B relies on less precise measuring cylinders for preparing the analyte. Furthermore, Essay A's discussion of controlled variables is more detailed, explaining not just *what* will be controlled but also *why* it's important for the results. The inclusion of a \"What was changed\" section in Essay A shows a commendable process of preliminary work and refinement, a key aspect of scientific exploration. While Essay B's \"Evaluation\" section is strong, it acknowledges some of the methodological weaknesses already apparent, such as the use of less precise glassware. Therefore, based on the superior planning, precision, and justification evident in the experimental design, Essay A is the stronger piece of work for Criterion B.",
