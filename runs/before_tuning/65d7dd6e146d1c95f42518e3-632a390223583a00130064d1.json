  "reasoning": "The response provided comprehensively analyzes various components of both Investigation Design, including the research question, control of variables, data processing and analysis and conclusion. The response consistently provides insightful commentary and suggestions for further improvement. In terms of Research Question and introduction, Student A clearly states the independent variable (concentration of sodium bicarbonate) but lacks a clear specification of the methodology for controlling it. The dependent variable is somewhat vaguely defined as 'how much force it can withstand', which could be improved with more precision. The mention of using cornstarch as an alternative to crude oil and the research process leading to sodium bicarbonate lacks proper citation. On the a similar note, student B has similar strengths as student A regarding the selection of both independent and dependent variables. However, student B's personal engagement with making eco-friendly plastic and the explanation of the concept of biodegradability and tensile strength provides a slightly stronger personal engagement and deeper conceptual understanding. For materials, Student A shows a thorough list of necessary materials, though specific models of the instruments (like the specific scale and pH probe model) are not specified. This leads to a slight lack of precision. Student B's list is adequate but similarly lacks specifics. For example, 'weighing boats' could be specified as 'balance'. The safety and environmental sections of both essays are well-developed. Student A's procedure for HCl is especially well-detailed, but the method for applying force lacks clarity. Student B provides a method for making the bioplastic, but it has some minor omissions and lacks detail on ensuring uniform thickness.  In data analysis, student A gives a formula for everything mentioned, which is excellent. Student B, however, also provides the formulas used but doesn't mention some of them in the procedure, like the use of a pH meter. Overall, both pieces of work are very well developed and organized. However, the slightly clearer context and personal connection in Student A's work gives it a slight edge.",
