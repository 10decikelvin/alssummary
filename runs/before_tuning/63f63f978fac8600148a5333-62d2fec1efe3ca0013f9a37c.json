  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of the scientific process and the requirements for the Exploration criterion. Its research question is highly focused and sets clear, measurable parameters (pH 1.0-5.0, quantification by spectrophotometry). The background section is comprehensive, detailing the chemical principles of biosorption, ion exchange, and the specific functional groups involved, thereby providing a robust theoretical framework for the hypothesis. Crucially, Essay A includes a section on preliminary trials, which showcases genuine engagement, problem-solving, and a refinement of the methodology based on empirical evidence\u2014a hallmark of excellent scientific practice. The control of variables is also more rigorous, with clear justification for why each variable (e.g., temperature, orange brand) needs to be controlled.\n\nWhile Essay B presents a solid investigation, it is comparatively weaker. The rationale feels more generic, stemming from a general classroom curiosity rather than a detailed exploration of a specific problem. The methodology relies on a subjective \"naked eye\" endpoint, which introduces significant potential for random error compared to the precise spectrophotometric analysis in Essay A. Furthermore, the control of variables is less thoroughly justified; for instance, the explanation for controlling temperature lacks the specific chemical reasoning provided in Essay A. Essay B's methodology also contains significant procedural flaws, such as using large burettes for small volumes, which creates high uncertainty, a weakness the student acknowledges in their evaluation but did not rectify in the design. Therefore, Essay A's thoroughness, sophisticated methodology, and clear evidence of preliminary work make it substantially better.",
