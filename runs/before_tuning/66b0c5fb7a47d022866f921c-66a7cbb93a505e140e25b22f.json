  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a significantly more rigorous and well-designed exploration compared to Essay B, making it the superior submission for Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its meticulous handling of variables. The controlled variables are not only identified but are also accompanied by excellent justifications for *why* they must be controlled and detailed methods for *how* they will be controlled, such as setting the air conditioner to \"ensure the same amount of heat is lost across all trials.\" Furthermore, the justification for the selection of independent variable concentrations is rooted in real-world context (\"E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia\") and experimental validity (\"increments are consistent\"), demonstrating a high level of scientific thought. The research question is focused, and the methodology, while standard, is appropriate and clearly detailed.\n\nEssay B, while having a strong personal context and adequate background information, contains a critical flaw in its experimental design. The student explicitly states, \"I will not be controlling the mass of the tablet to give an accurate representation of each tablet.\" This decision demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of controlled variables. To scientifically compare the effectiveness of the different active ingredients or brands, the mass of the reactant should have been kept constant. The justification based on \"realism\" undermines the goal of a fair scientific comparison of the substances' chemical properties. Additionally, the chosen direct titration method is problematic for sparingly soluble antacids, where a back titration would have been a much more appropriate and accurate technique. While Essay B adequately covers safety and background theory, its flawed variable control and suboptimal methodology make it significantly weaker than Essay A.",
