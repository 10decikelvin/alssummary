  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger fulfillment of the Criterion B requirements. The research question in Essay B, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach... reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is exceptionally focused and well-defined, clearly stating the independent variable (bleach concentration), dependent variable (reaction rate), and the specific method of measurement. In contrast, Essay A's research question is less focused, attempting to investigate three different water sources and compare two different measurement techniques simultaneously, which complicates the experimental design and dilutes the central investigation.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is comprehensive, scientifically detailed, and highly relevant. It effectively uses sources to discuss the kinetics, the chemical properties of bleach, the principles of spectrophotometry (including the Beer-Lambert law), and the underlying collision theory. This provides a robust theoretical foundation that directly justifies the methodology. Essay A's background explains the Winkler method well but has a significant omission: it fails to explain the fundamental chemical or physical principles of why increasing salinity (NaCl concentration) would affect the concentration of dissolved oxygen, which is the core of its investigation.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is more rigorous and thoughtful. The inclusion of a preliminary test to determine the unknown bleach concentration via titration shows a high level of planning and scientific diligence. The variables are not only identified but are justified with clear links to chemical principles. While Essay A also identifies its variables and has a strong safety section, its overall experimental design is overly ambitious and less controlled due to the introduction of \"different water sources\" as an uncontrolled variable. Essay B's approach is more controlled, focused, and demonstrates a superior understanding of experimental design.",
