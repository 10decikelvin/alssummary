  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision favors Essay B primarily due to its superior research question and stronger theoretical background, which are central to Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083(aq)) change with its concentration?\", is focused, clear, and appropriately scoped for an investigation. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen of samples of 100cm3 of water from different water sources, when temperature is kept constant?\", is convoluted. It attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously (salt concentration and water source) and also adds a tertiary goal of comparing analytical methods, which significantly weakens its focus.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B provides a more sophisticated scientific context, explaining the mechanism by which dissolved ions are expected to lower the specific heat capacity of water by forming a \"rigid matrix.\" This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. While Essay A's background on the Winkler method is detailed, its overall justification for the experiment feels less coherent due to the muddled research question.\n\nEssay A does have some significant strengths, particularly in its thorough treatment of variables and safety considerations. The variables are presented in a clear table with excellent justifications, and the safety, ethical, and environmental section is specific and detailed, mentioning correct disposal procedures for named chemicals like sulfuric acid. Essay B is notably weaker in this area, with minimal safety precautions and generic environmental considerations.\n\nHowever, the foundation of a scientific exploration is a well-defined question and a clear rationale. Essay B excels in this fundamental aspect. Despite its weaker safety section and a slight imprecision in defining its dependent variable, its clear scientific direction and strong theoretical underpinning make it a better example of a well-planned investigation under Criterion B. Essay A's attempt to cover too much ground detracts from the quality of its exploration, even with its procedural and safety-related strengths.",
