  "reasoning": "Essay A is substantially better as it demonstrates a much higher level of scientific rigor and thoroughness in its experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"How does varying salinity...and temperature...affect the amount of dissolved oxygen...measured through Winkler's titration?\", is excellently formulated; it is focused, complex by investigating two independent variables, and specifies clear, wide ranges for each (six levels for salinity and six for temperature). This design allows for the collection of sufficient and relevant data to explore a meaningful relationship. In contrast, Essay B's research question is less precise, and its methodology is critically flawed by only testing two concentrations of copper (II) sulphate (0.5M and 1.0M), which is insufficient to establish a trend.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's background information provides a strong real-world context (global warming's effect on oceans) and justifies the choice of Winkler's titration over alternative methods, showing critical thinking. Its tables detailing the independent, dependent, and controlled variables are exemplary, with detailed explanations for why and how each variable is managed. Essay B's background contains good theoretical depth with Gibbs free energy calculations, but this is undermined by a confused hypothesis that introduces an un-tested variable (\"surface area\"). Its treatment of controlled variables and safety considerations is also far less detailed and professional than Essay A's. The procedure in Essay A is meticulous and includes small but important details like adding reagents below the water's surface to minimize error, a level of detail absent in Essay B.",
