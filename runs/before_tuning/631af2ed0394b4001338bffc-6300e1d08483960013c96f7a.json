  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Essay A's research question, \"How does the total content of calcium and magnesium free ions relate quantitatively to the total content of protein and the total content of fat in cow\u2019s, almond, coconut, oat, rice and soy milks?\", is sophisticated, focused, and grounded in a genuine gap identified from scientific literature. The background information is comprehensive, detailed, and demonstrates a high level of chemical understanding regarding complex equilibria, protein-ion interactions, and the principles of complexometric titration. In contrast, Essay B's research question is much simpler, and while the background on freezing point depression is relevant, it lacks the depth and academic rigor of Essay A.\n\nThe methodology is the most significant point of differentiation. Essay A outlines a precise, replicable, and appropriate quantitative procedure (complexometric titration) to answer its research question. The identification and control of variables are exemplary, with clear justification for each, and it even considers uncontrolled variables, showing critical thought. Essay B's methodology is fundamentally flawed; it proposes controlling salt by mass instead of moles, which contradicts its own theoretical background (freezing point depression depends on molality and the number of ions). Furthermore, the procedure for collecting the melted water is unclear, and running the trials sequentially instead of in parallel fails to properly control for ambient temperature.\n\nFinally, Essay A includes a thorough and thoughtful risk assessment that addresses safety, environmental, and ethical considerations. Essay B completely omits this crucial section, which is a major failing under Criterion B. Overall, Essay A presents a well-researched, meticulously planned, and scientifically sound exploration, whereas Essay B presents a simplistic investigation with significant methodological flaws and omissions.",
