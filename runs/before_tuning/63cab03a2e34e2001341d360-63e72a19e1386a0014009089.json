  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design and the requirements for a focused scientific investigation. Its research question, \"How does an increase in salt concentration of NaCl in ppt... affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration...?\", is specific, measurable, and establishes a clear relationship between an independent and a dependent variable. This focus is maintained throughout the background, which provides excellent chemical context for the \"salting out\" effect. The variables section in Essay B is exemplary, presenting the controlled variables in a clear table with methods and justifications for their control, which is far more thorough than Essay A's simple list.\n\nEssay A, while having a detailed procedure, is built upon a weaker foundation. Its research question is poorly formulated, using the qualitative concept of \"pollution level\" as its independent variable and confusingly mentioning \"secondary data\" while describing a primary investigation. This lack of a quantifiable independent variable makes it difficult to establish a clear and reliable relationship, rendering the investigation more of a comparative study than a controlled experiment. While Essay A's risk assessment is good, particularly its inclusion of environmental considerations, Essay B's overall scientific rigor, from the focused research question to the detailed justification of controlled variables, is significantly superior and demonstrates a higher level of understanding of the scientific process.",
