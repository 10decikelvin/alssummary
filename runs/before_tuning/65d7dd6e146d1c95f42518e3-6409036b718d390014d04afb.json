  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide a solid foundation for a chemistry IA, but they have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Submission A (Untitled) presents a more traditional and focused chemistry investigation into the effect of an organic acid (acetic acid) on reaction rate. The methodology is straightforward and well-explained, making the experiment easy to replicate and understand. However, the background information is quite general and could be more detailed, specifically regarding the reaction mechanism between calcium carbonate and acids. The analysis focuses primarily on a linear relationship, which is a bit simplistic for a higher-level analysis. \n\nSubmission B (",
