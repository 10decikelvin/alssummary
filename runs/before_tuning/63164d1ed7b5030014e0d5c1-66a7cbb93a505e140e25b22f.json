  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable and well-contextualized investigations appropriate for the IB Chemistry IA. However, Essay A demonstrates a more robust and scientifically sound experimental design, making its exploration superior.\n\nEssay A's strength lies in its clear and logical methodology. The research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C...content...change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is directly addressed by systematically manipulating a single independent variable (time) while carefully controlling all other relevant factors (mass of pepper, water temperature, etc.). This clean design allows for a direct causal link to be investigated between heating time and vitamin C loss. The background information is relevant, concise, and provides the necessary chemical context for the redox titration.\n\nEssay B, while strong in its background section with detailed explanations and balanced chemical equations for each antacid, contains a significant flaw in its experimental design. The student states they will not control for the mass of the tablet, justifying this by wanting a \"realistic answer\" for a whole tablet. This choice conflates two key variables: the type of active ingredient and the mass of the tablet. The research question explicitly asks how the \"different active ingredients...compare,\" but the methodology is designed to compare whole commercial tablets of potentially different masses, making it impossible to draw a valid conclusion about the chemical efficacy of the ingredients themselves. This mismatch between the research question and the method's ability to answer it is a major weakness.\n\nWhile Essay B includes excellent details like justifying the HCl concentration based on preliminary trials and planning for five trials per sample, these do not compensate for the fundamental design flaw. Essay A's methodology is more rigorous and better suited to answer its research question in a controlled, scientific manner. Therefore, Essay A represents a higher quality of exploration under Criterion B.",
