  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger and more focused approach to the experimental design, making it the superior example for Criterion B. The research question in Essay B is exemplary: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...\". It is specific, quantifiable, and clearly outlines the independent and dependent variables as well as key conditions. In contrast, Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased (\"How does the dissolved oxygen level changes with change in source of water...\") and contradicts the methodology by mentioning \"comparing secondary data\" when a primary investigation is described.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background section provides a thorough theoretical foundation, explaining the reaction mechanism, rate law, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, all of which are directly relevant to the investigation. While Essay A provides good context on pollution, Essay B's detailed chemical theory is more appropriate for a high-level chemistry IA. The methodology in Essay B is also superior, as it details the preliminary testing that informed the final procedure, which is a hallmark of excellent experimental design. Essay B's identification and justification of variables in a detailed table is far more comprehensive than Essay A's simple list. Finally, both essays have strong risk assessments, but Essay B's evaluation of methodological weaknesses is more insightful, offering specific and practical improvements for each identified issue.",
