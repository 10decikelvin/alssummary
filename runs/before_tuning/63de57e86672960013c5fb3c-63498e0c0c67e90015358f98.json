  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-defined and focused research questions appropriate for an IB Chemistry investigation. Essay B's topic, investigating the \"diverse ion effect\" on solubility using spectrophotometry, is chemically sophisticated and demonstrates strong conceptual understanding. Its use of a table to clearly outline the controlled variables, explaining both why and how they are controlled, is an excellent practice. However, Essay A is superior overall due to its exceptional thoroughness across all aspects of Criterion B. Its background research is more comprehensive, citing multiple studies to justify the methodology and hypothesis. The procedure in Essay A is meticulously detailed, providing specific quantities and step-by-step instructions that make it easily replicable, a key aspect of a strong scientific exploration.\n\nThe most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental (SEE) considerations. Essay A provides a detailed risk assessment, identifying specific hazards for each chemical (e.g., \"Sulphuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a highly corrosive... can cause rapid tissue destruction\") and outlining specific, responsible disposal methods (e.g., neutralizing acid with sodium carbonate). In contrast, Essay B's safety precautions are very brief, and it completely omits any mention of environmental considerations or waste disposal, which is a major weakness for this criterion. Therefore, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and masterful fulfillment of the requirements for Exploration.",
