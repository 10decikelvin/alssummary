  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of planning, detail, and awareness required for an excellent exploration. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate... affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is both focused and original. The methodology is exceptionally thorough, with precise quantities, uncertainties, and a step-by-step guide for both creating the samples and collecting data using specialized software like LabQuest 2 and Tracker. Essay A's treatment of variables is exemplary; it not only lists controlled variables but justifies *why* they must be controlled and explicitly identifies uncontrolled variables, such as \"Uniform Depth of Sample,\" showing a deep understanding of the experiment's limitations. In contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question (\"How does the specific heat capacity of aqueous Potassium Nitrate... change with its concentration?\"), presents a less complete methodology, failing to specify the different masses of KNO\u2083 that will be used. While Essay B does address variables and safety, its discussion is more superficial compared to Essay A's comprehensive tables. Furthermore, Essay A\u2019s risk assessment is more thoughtful, including not just safety but also detailed environmental and ethical considerations like the \"Use of edible materials.\" Therefore, Essay A is superior due to its meticulous detail, proactive consideration of variables and limitations, and more comprehensive safety and ethical analysis.",
