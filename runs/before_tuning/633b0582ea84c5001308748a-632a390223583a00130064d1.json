  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and viable investigations. Essay A's research question, \"Does the number of carbon atoms in a chain of an alcohol affect its standard enthalpy of combustion?\" and its effect on boiling point, is clear and well-grounded in thermochemistry. Its methodology, while being a database investigation, is appropriate, citing credible sources like NIST and explaining data processing steps. The background information effectively links intermolecular forces and bond enthalpies to the research question. However, Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of experimental design and personal engagement. Its research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate ... affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\" is focused and sophisticated. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, outlining a complex hands-on procedure with a thorough list of justified controlled variables (e.g., \"Amount of time on Bunsen Burner after the integration of the Sodium Bicarbonate Solution\") and even acknowledging uncontrolled variables (\"Uniform Depth of Sample\"). Furthermore, Essay B's risk assessment is exemplary, not only covering safety and environmental factors but also thoughtfully including ethical considerations regarding the use of food materials, a level of detail and reflection absent in Essay A. This comprehensive approach to methodology and safety/ethical/environmental issues makes Essay B a superior example of the exploration criterion.",
