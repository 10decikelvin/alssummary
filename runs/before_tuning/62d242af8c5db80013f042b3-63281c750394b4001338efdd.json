  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger and demonstrates a more thorough and thoughtful approach to the experimental design. Its research question is highly specific, clearly outlining the independent variable (temperature with five precise levels), the dependent variable (calcium content), the specific substance (flavored milk), and the analytical method (EDTA complexometric titration). The background information is detailed, relevant, and scientifically robust, correctly explaining the principles of complexometric back titration and providing a chemical basis for why temperature might affect calcium availability in milk. The methodology section is exemplary, featuring a comprehensive table of variables that not only identifies them but also explains precisely *how* they will be controlled and *why* it's important to do so. Furthermore, Essay A includes a justification for its chosen method by comparing it to alternatives (FAAS, ISE-CT), demonstrating a deeper understanding of analytical techniques. The safety precautions are specific to the chemicals being used (e.g., handling ammonia) and are well-justified.\n\nEssay B, while covering the necessary components, is less developed. The research question is clear, but the background information provides a somewhat simplistic explanation of the phenomenon. The list of controlled variables is less comprehensive and lacks the crucial justification for *why* each variable must be controlled. The procedure is less detailed, notably omitting the specific concentrations that will be tested, which is a key part of the investigation. Finally, the safety precautions in Essay B are generic and not tailored to the specific risks of the experiment. Overall, Essay A presents a much more rigorous, detailed, and well-considered plan for investigation, aligning more closely with the highest marks in Criterion B.",
