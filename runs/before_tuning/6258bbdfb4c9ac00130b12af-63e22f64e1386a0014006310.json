  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay A demonstrates a more comprehensive and meticulous approach to the experimental design. Essay B's research question is more sophisticated, clearly outlining a two-part investigation: \"a) What is the relationship between the length of the carbon chain... and the enthalpy change of combustion...? b) What is the impact of the classification... on the enthalpy change of combustion...?\" This shows a higher level of inquiry than Essay A's more straightforward investigation. However, Essay A excels in the depth and rigour of its methodology and supporting details. For instance, its procedure includes detailed steps for \"Preparing and standardizing molarity of potassium hydroxide solution,\" which shows an advanced understanding of chemical preparation and accuracy. Furthermore, Essay A's table of controlled variables is exemplary, not only stating how to control them but also explicitly justifying \"Why to control?\" each one, such as controlling moisture because it \"affects the amount of free fatty acid present in oil.\" In contrast, while Essay B's controlled variables are appropriate, the justifications are slightly less detailed. The most significant differentiator is the treatment of safety, ethical, and environmental considerations. Essay A provides a thorough risk assessment table and then explicitly addresses both \"Ethical issues\" (responsible use of cooking oil) and \"Environmental Issues\" (disposal of hazardous chemicals). Essay B's safety section is adequate but completely omits any discussion of ethical or environmental factors, which is a clear weakness. Therefore, despite Essay B's stronger research question, Essay A's superior methodological detail and its complete consideration of all aspects of Criterion B make it the better essay.",
