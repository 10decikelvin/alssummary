  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B demonstrates a more sophisticated and thorough approach to experimental design. Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-defined, and the author strengthens it by explaining how preliminary tests led to its refinement: \"When pre-testing, I noticed that the rate of reaction... was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3... due to this I decided to use lower concentrations... to achieve a clearer trend.\" This inclusion of a pre-test section is a mark of high-level exploration, showing a proactive and reflective approach to methodology. In contrast, while Essay A's research question is clear, it contains a significant conceptual error in its variables section, incorrectly identifying \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable when it is effectively a second independent variable.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's background information provides a more focused theoretical foundation (collision theory, neutralization reactions) that directly justifies the hypothesis. Its safety and environmental considerations are also more detailed, featuring a chemical-specific hazard table and a discussion on minimizing waste based on stoichiometric calculations. Essay A's procedure and background are solid, but they lack the depth of planning and reflection demonstrated in Essay B. The meticulous justification for every methodological choice in Essay B, from the IV range to the time duration, sets it apart as the superior example of exploration.",
