  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong \"Exploration\" sections. They each have a focused and well-articulated research question, provide relevant background information, and detail a thorough, repeatable methodology with appropriate variables and safety considerations.\n\nEssay A stands out for its ambitious design, comparing two distinct analytical techniques (back titration and thermal decomposition) to determine the composition of three different substances. The personal engagement is clearly stated and provides a good narrative for the choice of samples. The methodology is detailed and appropriate for an IB Chemistry IA.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a slightly deeper and more sophisticated understanding of the underlying chemical principles. The background information goes beyond simple definitions to thoroughly explain concepts like water's polarity, dipole-induced dipole forces, and the \"salting out\" effect with ion-dipole forces. This shows a very high level of research and comprehension. Furthermore, the research question in Essay B is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations and uncertainty of the independent variable. The procedure and safety considerations are also very thorough.\n\nWhile Essay A's comparative approach is commendable, Essay B's meticulous detail in the background chemical theory gives it a slight edge. It shows a more profound engagement with the chemistry behind the phenomenon being investigated, which is a key aspect of the Exploration criterion.",
