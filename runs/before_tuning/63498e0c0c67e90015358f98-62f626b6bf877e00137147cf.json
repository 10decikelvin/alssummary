  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of each essay against the core requirements of Criterion B: Exploration, which includes the research question, background, methodology, variables, and safety considerations.\n\nEssay A presents a far superior exploration. Its research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is focused, specific, and clearly outlines the independent variable, dependent variable, and the quantitative method of measurement. The background section provides excellent scientific context, explaining concepts like solvation and the \"salting in effect\" to justify the hypothesis. The methodology is logical and detailed, including a crucial calibration experiment and clear steps for the main procedure. Most impressively, Essay A includes a comprehensive table of controlled variables, explaining not only what was controlled but also why and how, demonstrating a high level of scientific thinking.\n\nIn stark contrast, Essay B is significantly underdeveloped. Its research question is awkwardly phrased and lacks specificity regarding the independent variable (e.g., what specific time points relative to the expiration date will be tested?). The background is almost non-existent, offering only a single generic sentence about titration without explaining the complexometric process, the chemistry of EDTA, or providing any scientific rationale for why calcium content might change over time in milk. The methodology is an incomplete list of steps, and it critically fails to identify or discuss any controlled variables (e.g., milk brand, fat content, storage temperature), which is a major flaw in experimental design. While Essay B does have a solid risk assessment, this single strength cannot compensate for the profound deficiencies in every other aspect of the exploration.\n\nUltimately, Essay A demonstrates a cohesive and well-researched plan for a scientific investigation, whereas Essay B presents an incomplete and poorly rationalized idea.",
