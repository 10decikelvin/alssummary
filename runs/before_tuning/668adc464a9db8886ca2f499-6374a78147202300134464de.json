  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of planning, detail, and understanding of the underlying chemical principles, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its research question is highly specific, listing the exact concentrations to be tested, which reflects thorough preliminary work. The background information is comprehensive, seamlessly integrating personal context with relevant chemical theory, including the Beer-Lambert Law, reaction kinetics, and a detailed explanation of the titration needed to determine the initial bleach concentration. The methodology is meticulous, featuring a dedicated pre-test section to determine the optimal wavelength and initial concentration, which is a hallmark of a well-designed investigation. Furthermore, the handling of variables in Essay A is exemplary; its table of controlled variables not only identifies them but also explains their significance and the precise method of control.\n\nEssay B, while covering a valid topic, is weaker in comparison. Its research question is acceptable but lacks the precision of Essay A's. The background information contains a significant conceptual confusion, conflating the effect of concentration on reaction rate with its effect on enthalpy change (\u0394H), which is a state function dependent on the amount of limiting reactant, not the concentration of the excess reactant. The experimental design is also less robust, proposing only two concentrations (0.5M and 1.0M), which is insufficient to establish a clear trend or relationship. While it correctly identifies key variables and safety precautions, the level of detail and scientific rigor does not match that of Essay A. Overall, Essay A presents a much more thoughtful, well-researched, and scientifically sound plan of investigation.",
