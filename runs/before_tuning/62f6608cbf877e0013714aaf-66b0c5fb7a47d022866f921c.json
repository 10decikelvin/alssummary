  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly more sophisticated and well-designed investigation, making it superior in Criterion B. The research question, \"How does the rate constant of the saponification reaction of ethyl acetate with sodium hydroxide vary with absolute temperature?\", is focused and leads to a complex but manageable experimental plan. Essay A's strength lies in its excellent theoretical foundation; it correctly introduces the Arrhenius equation and derives the second-order integrated rate law, providing a clear mathematical link between the planned measurements (concentration via titration over time) and the dependent variable (the rate constant, k). The methodology, involving quenching the reaction and performing titrations, is a standard and appropriate technique for studying reaction kinetics, showcasing a high level of chemical understanding.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's investigation into the enthalpy of combustion of gasohol is a very common and simple topic. A major weakness is the confusion in defining the dependent variable as \"The total mass of the fuel burnt,\" when in fact, the dependent variable is the enthalpy of combustion, which is *calculated* from the mass of fuel burnt. Furthermore, the chosen methodology\u2014simple spirit burner calorimetry with an open copper can\u2014is known to be fraught with massive systematic errors from heat loss and incomplete combustion. While the essay acknowledges this, its claim that the error is consistent across trials is highly questionable, especially since it notes that soot production (a sign of incomplete combustion) varies with the fuel mixture, which directly undermines the validity of the trend.\n\nEssay A's control variables are well-considered and its procedure is detailed and logical for a complex kinetic study. Essay B's procedure is standard for a low-level experiment, but its fundamental design flaws make it less suitable for a high-quality investigation. Therefore, Essay A's superior choice of topic, rigorous theoretical background, and more appropriate experimental design clearly make it the better essay for Criterion B.",
