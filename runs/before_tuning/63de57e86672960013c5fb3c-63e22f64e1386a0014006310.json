  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration of its research topic compared to Essay B, particularly in its background research, methodological rigor, and consideration of safety and environmental factors. Essay A's research question, \"How does the voltage increase (2V, 4V, 6V, 8V, 10V) in an electrolytic cell affect the percentage mass increase of a copper-nickel cathode after a 10-minute interval?\", is highly focused and well-defined. The background section is exemplary; it not only explains the underlying principles of electrolysis but also grounds the investigation in established science by referencing Faraday's first law and citing previous studies, which provides a strong theoretical and academic context. Furthermore, its methodology is meticulous, with well-justified controlled variables and specific, practical steps to ensure their control, such as marking a wooden splint to maintain a constant distance between electrodes. The safety, ethical, and environmental section is comprehensive, identifying specific chemical hazards and providing detailed, appropriate disposal methods for copper sulphate and sulphuric acid.\n\nEssay B, while addressing an interesting two-part research question about the enthalpy of combustion of alcohols, is weaker in several key areas of Criterion B. Its background information is adequate for explaining the basic concepts but lacks the depth and external research evident in Essay A. The methodology relies on simple calorimetry, a technique known for large systematic errors from heat loss, which is a significant design limitation. Most critically, Essay B completely omits any discussion of environmental considerations regarding the disposal of the various alcohols used, which is a major oversight for this criterion. While its safety assessment is acceptable, it does not match the specificity of Essay A. Overall, Essay A presents a more thoughtfully designed, thoroughly researched, and responsibly considered investigation.",
