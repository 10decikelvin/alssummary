  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the requirements of IB Criterion B: Exploration. Essay A is significantly stronger across nearly all aspects of this criterion.\n\nFirst, Essay A presents a highly focused and well-formulated research question: \"How does an increase in ionic radii... affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting...?\" This question clearly defines the independent variable (ionic radii of specific ions), the dependent variable (d-orbital splitting energy), and the method of measurement. In contrast, Essay B's question, \"...how significant is the variation in calcium content (mg) of fresh milk depending on the expiration date?\" is less precise, particularly regarding the independent variable \"expiration date,\" which is not clearly defined.\n\nSecond, the background information in Essay A is extensive, scientifically accurate, and directly relevant to the research question. It thoroughly explains complex concepts like d-orbital splitting, ligands, and spectrophotometry, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the experiment. Essay B, however, offers an exceptionally weak introduction, with only a single generic sentence about titration, failing to establish any context for complexometric titration, EDTA, or the chemistry of calcium in milk.\n\nThird, Essay A excels in its identification and justification of variables. It explicitly lists the independent, dependent, and a comprehensive set of controlled variables, explaining why each must be controlled. Essay B completely omits a dedicated variables section, a critical failure for Criterion B.\n\nFinally, while both essays provide adequate safety considerations, Essay A's methodology is clearly outlined and replicable. Essay B's methodology appears incomplete and is poorly structured. Overall, Essay A demonstrates a far deeper level of engagement, planning, and scientific understanding, making it the clear winner.",
