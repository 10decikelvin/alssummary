  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough approach to the experimental design and methodology. Its research question is highly focused, clearly defining the independent variable (temperature), dependent variable (calcium content), and the specific analytical technique (EDTA complexometric titration). Essay A's background information provides detailed, relevant chemical theory behind complexometric back titrations, demonstrating a solid understanding of the procedure. The identification and justification of variables are exemplary; it features a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear methods for their control and scientific reasons for why control is necessary. In contrast, Essay B's research question is broader, investigating two independent variables (anion type and temperature) simultaneously, and its variable section is confusing and incomplete, incorrectly identifying the \"weight of the salts\" as an independent variable and providing a very sparse list of controlled variables.\n\nFurthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed, logical, and replicable, including specific concentrations and volumes, and it thoughtfully justifies the choice of titration over other methods. Essay B's procedure is vague and misses critical information, such as the volume of solvent used, which is a fundamental flaw. Finally, Essay A excels in its evaluation, presenting a detailed table of safety precautions with justifications, considering environmental impact, and offering a critical assessment of limitations with specific, viable improvements. Essay B's consideration of safety is minimal, and its discussion of limitations and strengths is far more superficial. Overall, Essay A presents a well-planned, scientifically sound, and thoroughly considered investigation that is superior to Essay B in every aspect of Criterion B.",
