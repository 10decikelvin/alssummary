  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger grasp of Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, including concentrations, temperatures, and the specific analytical method. The background section is comprehensive, effectively linking reaction kinetics, the Arrhenius equation, and spectrophotometry (Beer-Lambert Law) to the experimental design, showcasing a deep theoretical understanding. The methodology is robust, with the inclusion of preliminary trials being a significant strength, as it demonstrates a thoughtful and iterative approach to developing a workable procedure. The variables are meticulously identified, and the methods for their control are clearly explained and justified. Furthermore, the safety and environmental considerations are outstanding, with a detailed, chemical-by-chemical breakdown of risks and mitigation strategies.\n\nEssay B, while competent, is weaker in comparison. Although its research question is clear, the background information is more superficial, providing only the basic theory for the titration. The methodology is generally understandable but lacks the precision of Essay A and contains a significant contradiction regarding the iodine concentration between the variables section (0.1 M) and the materials list (0.05 M). The discussion of controlled variables is less thorough, and the safety section is perfunctory, incorrectly dismissing environmental concerns which should have been addressed regarding chemical disposal. Overall, Essay A presents a more sophisticated, rigorous, and carefully planned investigation that aligns more closely with the highest mark bands for Criterion B.",
