  "reasoning": "Essay A is stronger for Criterion B: Exploration. While both essays present clear and focused research questions with good personal engagement, Essay A provides a much more thorough and complete experimental plan. Its methodology is detailed, reproducible, and includes specific concentrations and measurements (e.g., \"115.016 grams of ZnSO\u2084\u00b77H\u2082O in 500 ml of distilled water\"). Crucially, Essay A includes a dedicated and thoughtful section on \"Safety Practices and Environmental Issues,\" addressing potential hazards like electrocution and chemical irritation, as well as the responsible disposal of materials.\n\nEssay B has a solid introduction and background information, effectively explaining the chemistry of ascorbic acid and the titration method. However, the provided text is incomplete. The table for variables is not filled out, the step-by-step procedure is missing entirely, and there is no mention of safety, environmental, or ethical considerations, which are essential components of this criterion. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Essay A demonstrates a significantly more comprehensive and well-planned investigation.",
