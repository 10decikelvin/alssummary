  "reasoning": "Essay A is superior as it demonstrates a much stronger and more rigorous approach to the experimental design and the underlying chemical theory required for Criterion B. The research question in Essay A, \"What is the reaction rate of different concentrations of bleach... reacting with blue food colouring, determined by a spectrophotometer?\", is specific, measurable, and grounded in established chemical principles. The background information is thorough, correctly identifying the active ingredient (NaClO), explaining the principles of spectrophotometry via the Beer-Lambert law, and even detailing the titration method used to determine the unknown bleach concentration. This shows a deep and relevant engagement with the topic. Furthermore, the variables are meticulously controlled, and the methods for this control are explicitly stated and justified, as seen in the excellent table provided.\n\nEssay B, while commendable for its ambition and originality, has significant flaws in its experimental design and theoretical foundation. Its research question uses a non-standard definition of concentration (\"100% concentration is equal to 5 grams of NaHCO\u2083 dissolved in 30 mL of H\u2082O\"), which is chemically imprecise. The background information provides a general overview of bioplastics but critically fails to explain the chemical mechanism by which sodium bicarbonate would affect the Young's Modulus of the polymer, which is a central aspect of the investigation's rationale. Most importantly, the methodology suffers from major uncontrolled variables, which the student acknowledges, such as the \"Uniform Depth of Sample\" and the \"Rate of Water Evaporation\". These uncontrolled factors would have a profound impact on the final physical properties of the plastic, making it very difficult to isolate the effect of the sodium bicarbonate concentration alone and thus undermining the validity of the entire experiment. While Essay B's consideration of ethics is a strong point, Essay A's overall scientific rigor, from its focused question to its detailed and well-controlled methodology, makes it a much stronger example of the Exploration criterion.",
