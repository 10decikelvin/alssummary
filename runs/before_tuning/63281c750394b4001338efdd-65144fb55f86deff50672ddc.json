  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger exploration and is the superior essay for Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does an increase in ionic radii... affect the energy difference in the d-orbital splitting (KJ/mol) of color complexes...\", is highly specific, complex, and firmly rooted in advanced IB Chemistry concepts (Topic 13: Transition Metals). In contrast, Essay A's question about specific heat capacity is scientifically valid but simpler and more standard. Essay B's background section is exceptionally thorough, seamlessly integrating personal engagement (tie-dyeing) with detailed chemical theory, including ligand exchange reactions, d-orbital splitting, and the spectrochemical series. Essay A's background is adequate but far less detailed, offering a very basic explanation for the expected phenomenon.\n\nFurthermore, the methodology in Essay B is more sophisticated, involving the synthesis of complex ions and analysis via spectrophotometry, and it thoughtfully includes a section on critical assumptions (e.g., complete ligand displacement, constant geometry), which shows a high level of forethought. Essay A's calorimetric method is sound but fails to address potential issues like the stability of the power supply in the planning stage. Finally, Essay B's safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are specific and justified, directly addressing the hazards of chemicals like ammonium hydroxide (\"toxic to aquatic life\") and prescribing proper disposal (\"inorganic waste bin\"). Essay A\u2019s precautions are generic and lack this level of specific detail. Overall, Essay B showcases a much deeper level of scientific inquiry, research, and critical planning.",
