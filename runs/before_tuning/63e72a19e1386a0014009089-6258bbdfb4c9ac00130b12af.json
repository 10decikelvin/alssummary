  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more comprehensive and well-thought-out approach to the exploration criterion. Its research question is clear, and the background information thoroughly explains the key concepts of Acid Value and Saponification Value, linking them directly to the quality of cooking oil. A standout feature is the \"Justification for methodology\" section, which explicitly explains the rationale behind the chosen temperatures, concentrations, and equipment, showing a deeper level of planning and understanding. The list of controlled variables is extensive and well-justified. Crucially, Essay B includes a detailed and robust \"Risk Assessment and safety issues\" section, covering chemical handling, flammability, and procedural hazards, as well as considering ethical and environmental impacts, which is a key component of this criterion.\n\nEssay A, while having a well-focused research question and a very strong background section with excellent chemical explanations and citations, is significantly let down by the complete absence of a safety, ethical, and environmental considerations section. While its procedure is detailed and its variables are well-controlled, this omission is a major flaw in the experimental design. Essay B's hypothesis is slightly weaker than Essay A's, as it states it cannot hypothesize for one of its variables, but its overall methodical planning, justification, and comprehensive risk assessment make it the superior submission for Criterion B.",
