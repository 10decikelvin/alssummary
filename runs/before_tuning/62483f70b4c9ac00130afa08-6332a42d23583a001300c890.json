  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations, but Essay B is superior due to its more focused and scientifically rigorous research question and methodology. Essay B's research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is clear, specific, and sets up a quantitative investigation perfectly aligned with the IB Chemistry syllabus. In contrast, Essay A's question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations...?\", is evaluative and less focused, making it a weaker foundation for a scientific experiment.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology demonstrates a higher level of independent planning by including detailed calculations for preparing the required solutions from solid reagents, a critical step that shows a thorough understanding of stoichiometry and solution chemistry. While Essay A has an excellent background section and a very strong safety assessment, its procedure is more of a standard titration protocol. Essay B's procedure, combined with its robust theoretical background on kinetics and the Arrhenius equation, presents a more comprehensive and well-integrated plan. The controlled variables in Essay B are clearly justified, and the procedure is meticulous enough to be easily replicated. Although Essay A's risk assessment is slightly more detailed, Essay B's overall scientific clarity, from the framing of the question to the detailed procedural planning, makes it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
