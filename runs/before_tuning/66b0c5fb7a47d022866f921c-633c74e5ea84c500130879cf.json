  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly stronger than Essay B across all aspects of Criterion B. Its research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is focused, clear, and investigates a single independent variable, which is a hallmark of a well-designed investigation. The background information provides excellent scientific and real-world context, directly justifying the choice of research question by linking thermochemistry to global issues like fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology is detailed and replicable, and its treatment of variables is exemplary, featuring a well-structured table for controlled variables with justifications and methods of control.\n\nConversely, Essay B is fundamentally flawed in its design. The research question, \"How does the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts of group one metals?\", attempts to investigate two independent variables simultaneously, which is inappropriate for this level of scientific inquiry and demonstrates a lack of focus. This confusion is further reflected in the variables section, where the student incorrectly identifies the measured dependent variable (crystallization temperature) as an independent variable. The list of controlled variables is sparse and lacks justification, and the methodology is vague in critical steps, making it difficult to replicate. Finally, Essay A includes thorough safety and environmental considerations, while Essay B's safety notes are minimal and it completely omits any discussion of environmental impact.\n\nIn summary, Essay A presents a well-conceived, thoroughly planned, and clearly articulated exploration that aligns perfectly with IB expectations for Criterion B. Essay B suffers from a poorly defined research question and a demonstrated misunderstanding of experimental variables, making it a much weaker submission.",
