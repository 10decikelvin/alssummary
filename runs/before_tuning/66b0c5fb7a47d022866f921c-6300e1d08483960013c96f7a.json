  "reasoning": "Essay A is demonstrably superior to Essay B in its fulfillment of Criterion B. The primary strength of Essay A lies in its meticulous and well-justified methodology. The research question, \"How does the volumetric concentration of C2H5OH (ethanol) affect the enthalpy of combustion in various gasohol mixtures?\", is focused and allows for a quantitative investigation. Its discussion of variables is exemplary; for instance, it justifies the choice of concentrations by linking them to real-world fuels like E10 and E85, and thoughtfully explains the decision to use kJ/g instead of kJ/mol due to the impure nature of gasoline, showing a high level of critical thinking. Furthermore, Essay A includes a comprehensive risk assessment, addressing safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific details like using a fume cupboard and proper waste disposal.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B, while having a clear research question and a solid theoretical background on freezing point depression, contains a critical flaw in its experimental design. The student aims to compare the effect of different salts but chooses to control for the *mass* of the salt (\"Measure only 5 grams of each salt\") rather than the *moles*. This fundamentally undermines the investigation, as the theory presented by the student themselves (based on the Van't Hoff factor 'i' and molality) depends on the number of particles (moles), not the mass. This is a significant conceptual error in the design. Additionally, Essay B's methodology lacks crucial details, such as how the melted water is separated from the remaining ice, and it completely omits any safety, ethical, or environmental considerations, which is a major deficiency for this criterion. While both essays establish good context, Essay A's exploration is far more rigorous, detailed, and scientifically sound.",
