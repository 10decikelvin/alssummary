  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger and more thorough exploration, making it the better essay for Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying both independent variables (salinity and temperature), their precise ranges, the dependent variable, and the exact measurement technique. The background section provides a clear real-world rationale (global warming's effect on marine ecosystems), justifies the choice of Winkler's titration over other methods, and supports its hypothesis with both chemical principles (e.g., \"dipole \u2013 induced dipole intermolecular bond\") and literature data. The methodology is the standout feature; the detailed tables for independent, dependent, and particularly the seven controlled variables show a masterful understanding of experimental design, with each variable including a clear justification and control method.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's exploration has several critical weaknesses. The research question, \"Is it possible to determine...\", is a less effective closed-ended question compared to Essay A's investigative \"How does...\" format. Most importantly, Essay B fundamentally misidentifies its variables, listing the dependent variable (\"Temperature change\") as an independent variable and vice-versa. This is a major conceptual error in experimental design. While the theoretical background on thermochemistry and the Hess's Law diagrams are strong, the proposed methodology is too simplistic for accurate calorimetry, relying on polystyrene cups without detailing crucial techniques like extrapolation to account for heat loss. Essay A's procedure, safety tables, and variable analysis are all more rigorous, detailed, and reflect a higher level of scientific planning.",
