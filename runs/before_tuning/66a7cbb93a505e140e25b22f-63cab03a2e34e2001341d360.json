  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and sophisticated exploration of its topic, despite a poorly worded research question. The scientific background in Essay B is exemplary, providing not only a real-world context with cited sources but also detailing the complex multi-step redox reactions of the Winkler method with correct chemical equations. The methodology is exceptionally detailed, including the preparation of all reagents from scratch and the crucial step of standardizing the sodium thiosulfate solution, which shows a much deeper level of chemical understanding and planning than Essay A. Furthermore, Essay B's risk assessment is outstanding; it provides a comprehensive, chemical-by-chemical breakdown of hazards, which is far superior to Essay A's generic safety statement.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A presents a solid but standard investigation. Its research question is clear and focused, which is a notable strength. The background information is relevant and includes the necessary neutralization equations. However, the methodology is relatively simple and lacks the procedural depth seen in Essay B. The decision not to control for the mass of the tablet, while justified from a \"real-world use\" perspective, is a methodological weakness when comparing the chemical efficacy of the active ingredients. While Essay A is a competent and well-structured piece of work, Essay B's ambition, complexity, and the depth of chemical knowledge it displays in its planning phase make it the superior example for Criterion B.",
