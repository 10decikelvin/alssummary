  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is for **essay_b** as it presents a more coherent and scientifically rigorous exploration, despite some minor flaws.\n\nEssay B's primary strength lies in its excellent contextualization and theoretical background. The student clearly explains the principles of chemical kinetics, including collision theory, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Arrhenius equation, effectively linking them to the research question and methodology. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. The research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is well-focused and leads to a sophisticated investigation appropriate for the IB level. The methodology is logical, and the inclusion of preparatory calculations for solutions shows meticulous planning.\n\nEssay A, while well-structured with excellent tables for variables and safety, suffers from significant flaws. There is a critical inconsistency in the independent variable values listed in the research question (\"20.0 oC, 40.0 oC, 60.0 oC, 80.0 oC, 100.0 oC\") versus those in the variables table (\"20.0, 35.0, 50.0, 65.0, 80.0\"), which undermines the clarity and focus of the investigation. Furthermore, the explanation of the back-titration chemistry is confusing and potentially inaccurate, which raises questions about the student's grasp of the chosen analytical technique. While the justification for the chosen method (titration vs. FAAS) and the detailed consideration of controlled variables are commendable, they cannot overcome the fundamental issues of inconsistency and questionable chemical understanding.\n\nUltimately, Essay B's robust scientific foundation, clear link between theory and practice, and more advanced research goal (calculating activation energy) demonstrate a superior level of exploration compared to Essay A, which is marred by internal contradictions and a muddled explanation of its core chemical procedure.",
