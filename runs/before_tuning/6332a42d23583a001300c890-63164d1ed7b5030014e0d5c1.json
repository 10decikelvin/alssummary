  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more methodologically rigorous and theoretically sophisticated investigation, making it the stronger of the two in Criterion B. Its research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is highly focused and sets up a classic kinetics experiment that allows for a deep dive into chemical theory. The background section expertly connects collision theory, Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the Arrhenius equation, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the principles underpinning the experiment. In contrast, while Essay B's research question is also clear and appropriate, its methodology concerning the extraction of Vitamin C (\"crush it till it the consistency becomes paste like...Pass the paste through your mesh strainer\") introduces significant and difficult-to-quantify systematic errors, as it is unlikely that all the ascorbic acid is extracted from the pepper pulp. Essay A's procedure, dealing with homogenous solutions, is far more controlled and reproducible. Furthermore, Essay A\u2019s risk assessment is more thorough, specifically identifying a hazardous waste product (KOH) and detailing its proper disposal, whereas Essay B's assessment is more generic. Finally, the inclusion of preliminary stoichiometric calculations, accounting for reagent purity and determining the limiting reactant, adds another layer of scientific rigor to Essay A's exploration that is absent in Essay B.",
