  "reasoning": "Essay A is significantly better than Essay B for Criterion B. Its primary strength lies in its exceptionally thorough and well-considered methodology. The research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate...affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", is focused and allows for a sophisticated investigation. Essay A provides a very detailed, step-by-step procedure for both synthesizing the bioplastic and testing its mechanical properties, making the experiment highly reproducible. Furthermore, the identification and control of variables are outstanding; the author provides a comprehensive table of controlled variables with clear methods of control and justification, and even thoughtfully considers uncontrolled variables and their potential impact. The risk assessment is also comprehensive, addressing safety, environmental, and ethical concerns in detail.\n\nEssay B, while having a clear research question and a solid background section that explains the relevant chemistry of ascorbic acid and titration, is fundamentally incomplete. The methodology, materials, risk assessment, and even the details of the variables are missing from the provided text. Although the background and hypothesis show a good understanding of the underlying chemical principles, such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, this cannot compensate for the absence of a workable and safe experimental plan.\n\nIn essence, Essay A presents a complete, detailed, and high-quality exploration section that demonstrates excellent scientific thinking and procedural planning. Essay B, by contrast, is an incomplete fragment that, while promising in its introduction, lacks the necessary components to be considered a viable experimental design. Therefore, Essay A is the clear winner.",
