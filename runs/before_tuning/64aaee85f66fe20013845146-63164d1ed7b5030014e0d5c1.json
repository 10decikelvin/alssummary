  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to the exploration criteria. Its research question, \"To what extent does the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content of a bell pepper change with time spent in a boiling water bath?\", is more focused and analytical than Essay A's, which is more of a descriptive title. Essay B's background section is exemplary, providing a clear chemical context by explaining the redox reaction between ascorbic acid and iodine, including the balanced chemical equation and the function of the starch indicator. In contrast, Essay A's background is more descriptive, failing to delve into the chemical principles of solvent extraction, such as polarity or why dichloromethane is a suitable solvent for caffeine.\n\nFurthermore, the methodology chosen in Essay B (iodometric titration) is a more chemically precise and accurate technique for quantifying a specific analyte than Essay A's method of evaporating the solvent and weighing the residue, which is highly susceptible to systematic errors from co-extracted impurities. Essay B also shows stronger experimental design by planning for three trials per data point. While both essays correctly identify variables, Essay B's risk assessment is more thorough, addressing both equipment (hot plate) and chemical (iodine) hazards. Critically, Essay A completely overlooks the significant environmental concerns associated with using and disposing of a chlorinated solvent like dichloromethane, a major omission. Overall, Essay B presents a more scientifically rigorous, well-justified, and thoughtfully planned investigation.",
