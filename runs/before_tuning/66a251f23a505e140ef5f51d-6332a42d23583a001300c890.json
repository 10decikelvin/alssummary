  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of both essays against the IB Chemistry Criterion B standards, which assess the quality of the investigation's exploration phase.\n\nEssay A demonstrates a superior level of scientific exploration and planning. Its research question is highly specific, stating the exact temperatures and concentrations to be used. The background information is exceptional, providing a deep theoretical foundation by linking the equilibrium constant (Kc) not only to Le Chatelier's Principle but also to Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation. Crucially, this theoretical context is expertly used to justify the experimental design, such as the use of a calibration curve based on Beer-Lambert's law and the addition of nitric acid to prevent side reactions. The inclusion of a \"Preliminary experiments\" section is a significant strength, showing an iterative and thoughtful approach to refining the methodology. The variables are presented in an exemplary table that clearly explains *why* and *how* each variable is controlled, a key requirement for top marks. Finally, the safety considerations are specific, identifying subtle risks like the potential formation of cyanide gas and providing clear, actionable precautions and disposal methods.\n\nEssay B presents a solid investigation but is weaker in several key areas. While its research question is appropriate, the background information is more generic, resembling a textbook summary of collision theory and the Arrhenius equation without the same level of integration into the specific experimental plan seen in Essay A. The methodology relies on a subjective visual endpoint (color change) to time the reaction, which is inherently less precise and reliable than the quantitative colorimetric measurements used in Essay A. The section on controlled variables is less detailed; for instance, the control measure for hazardous chemicals is generically stated as \"Very careful operations... and following the safety rules\" rather than specifying the use of goggles or gloves. Similarly, the safety assessment is less thorough, lacking the depth of specific chemical risks and precautions found in Essay A.\n\nIn summary, Essay A is better because its exploration is more sophisticated, its methodology is more robust and scientifically justified, and its attention to detail in controlling variables and assessing risks is significantly higher. Essay A's author demonstrates a deeper engagement with the scientific process, moving beyond a standard procedure to actively refine and justify their experimental approach based on sound theoretical principles.",
