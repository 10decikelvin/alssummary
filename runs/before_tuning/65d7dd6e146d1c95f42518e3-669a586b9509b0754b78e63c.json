  "reasoning": "The sample answer provided contains a more detailed and well-structured analysis, making it the superior choice. It offers a comprehensive methodology, including precise measurements and the use of a control. The data analysis is thorough, with clear calculations of the mean and standard deviation, and a graphical representation of the results. The discussion of errors is extensive, identifying specific sources of error and suggesting practical improvements. Furthermore, the inclusion of a section on potential extensions to the research demonstrates a deeper understanding of the scientific process. In contrast, the provided solution, while accurate, lacks this depth of detail and analysis. It presents the experimental setup but does not elaborate on the control measures taken or potential sources of error. The data analysis is limited to a statement of the result, without the inclusion of tables, graphs, or statistical analysis that would strengthen the conclusion. Therefore, the sample answer is better due to its comprehensive and detailed approach to the scientific method.",
