  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger and more complete exploration of its research topic compared to Essay A. The primary strength of Essay B lies in its well-defined and fully articulated methodology for a database investigation. It explicitly names its sources (\"ChemPub and Chemeo,\" \"HSDB,\" \"NIST Webbook\"), justifies their reliability, and thoughtfully considers how data will be processed and standardized, such as taking midpoints for ranges and converting units. Furthermore, Essay B clearly identifies its independent variable (\"number of carbons in a chain\"), dependent variables (\"enthalpy of combustion\" and \"boiling point\"), and a crucial controlled variable (\"only linear primary alcohols\"), showing a sophisticated level of experimental design. In contrast, Essay A, while presenting a valid research question and relevant background theory on redox titrations, completely fails to provide a methodology, leaving its variables table empty and omitting any safety or environmental considerations. Although Essay A's background successfully links kinetic theory to its hypothesis, this does not compensate for the absence of a planned procedure. Essay B also excels by integrating environmental considerations throughout its introduction and background, framing the entire investigation within a relevant real-world context, which is an effective way to address this criterion for a non-experimental study. Ultimately, Essay B presents a comprehensive and well-planned investigation, whereas Essay A presents an incomplete one.",
