  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and competent explorations that meet the requirements of Criterion B. Essay A provides a clear and focused research question about vitamin C degradation, supported by relevant background chemistry on redox titrations. Its methodology is logical and replicable, and the variables are clearly defined. Essay B, however, demonstrates a higher level of scientific engagement and complexity. Its research question on gasohol combustion is situated within a compelling real-world context of fuel efficiency and environmental impact. The background information effectively connects thermochemistry principles to this context.\n\nEssay B's superiority lies in its more sophisticated experimental design and deeper critical thinking. The justification for the chosen concentrations of ethanol, linking them to commercial fuels like E10 and E85, shows strong personal engagement. The table of controlled variables, which includes both *why* and *how* each is controlled, is exemplary. Furthermore, Essay B's risk assessment is more thorough, specifically mentioning the crucial use of a fume cupboard for combustion and providing concrete instructions for environmental disposal. The most telling difference is in the preliminary thinking about the data; Essay B includes a section on \"Assumptions made,\" discusses the implications of systematic error (\"the gradient, doesn't change as a result of a high systematic error\"), and links qualitative observations like soot formation directly to chemical principles of incomplete combustion. While Essay A is a very good execution of a standard experiment, Essay B displays a more mature and insightful approach to scientific investigation.",
