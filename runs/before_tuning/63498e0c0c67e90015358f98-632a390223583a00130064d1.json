  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and focused investigations. However, Essay A demonstrates a superior application of chemical principles in its experimental design and background, making it the stronger submission for Criterion B.\n\nEssay A's research question, \"How does varying Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) concentration affect the solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO4 \u00b72H2O) calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law?\", is sharply focused and grounded in core chemical concepts like solubility equilibria and spectrophotometry. Its background section provides a robust theoretical foundation, explaining the \"diverse ion effect\" and \"ionic strength\" with relevant diagrams and even citing literature data. The methodology is logical and scientifically sound, notably including a separate, detailed calibration experiment, which is crucial for the correct application of Beer-Lambert's Law and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of quantitative analysis. While its safety section is brief, the overall experimental design is clear, appropriate, and directly linked to the chemical theory presented.\n\nEssay B's topic on bioplastics is engaging and its methodology is exceptionally detailed, with a very thorough consideration of controlled and uncontrolled variables. The risk assessment in Essay B is a model of excellence, thoughtfully addressing safety, environmental, and ethical concerns, far surpassing the perfunctory section in Essay A. However, Essay B's primary weakness lies in its background information. While it defines bioplastics and Young's Modulus, it fails to provide a convincing chemical hypothesis or mechanism explaining *why* sodium bicarbonate concentration would affect the polymer's elasticity. This omission weakens the link between the independent and dependent variables from a chemical perspective, making the investigation feel more like a materials science or physics experiment.\n\nIn conclusion, while Essay B excels in procedural detail and safety considerations, Essay A presents a more cohesive and chemically-justified exploration. The strong connection between its theoretical background, research question, and methodology makes it the better example of a chemistry investigation.",
