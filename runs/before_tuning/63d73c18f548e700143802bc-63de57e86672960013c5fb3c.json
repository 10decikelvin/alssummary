  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of proficiency for Criterion B, presenting clear research questions, detailed methodologies, and thorough consideration of variables and safety. This is a very close comparison between two excellent pieces of work.\n\nEssay B is commendable for its strong personal engagement, linking the investigation to a real-world hobby of jewellery making. Its justification for the controlled variables is exceptionally clear, explaining not just *what* will be controlled but precisely *why* and *how*. Furthermore, its environmental considerations are more detailed and thoughtful than Essay A's, suggesting specific methods for neutralizing and disposing of chemical waste like copper sulphate and sulfuric acid.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a slightly superior level of scientific and theoretical rigor. The background information is more sophisticated, moving beyond basic principles to incorporate the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and, critically, an advanced equation for calculating theoretical buffer capacity (\"\u03b2=2.303 x...\"). This establishes a quantitative theoretical framework against which experimental results can be compared, indicating a deeper academic exploration. The justification for modifying the experimental system (using carbonate-bicarbonate instead of the less feasible carbonic acid-bicarbonate system found in blood) also shows mature scientific problem-solving. While both methodologies are robust, Essay A's use of a data logger and drop counter represents a more precise and technologically advanced approach to data collection. The meticulous justification and control of variables in a clear table format is also a significant strength.\n\nTherefore, while Essay B is excellent, Essay A has a slight edge due to its deeper theoretical foundation and the sophisticated link between its background research and its experimental design.",
