  "reasoning": "Both submissions present clear and focused research questions appropriate for the scope of the investigation. Essay B's personal engagement, connecting the experiment to restoring a vintage car, is particularly strong. Both also provide adequate background information relevant to their topics, with Essay A demonstrating a good grasp of reaction kinetics and the Beer-Lambert law, and Essay B clearly explaining the principles of electrolysis and Faraday's Laws.\n\nHowever, Essay A demonstrates a significantly more rigorous and well-controlled experimental design, which is the core of the Exploration criterion. The methodology in Essay A is meticulous, from the precise preparation of diluted bleach solutions to the use of a spectrophotometer for data collection, which is an appropriate and accurate tool for this investigation. The inclusion of a pre-test titration to determine the unknown concentration of the commercial bleach shows a high level of scientific forethought and attention to detail.\n\nConversely, Essay B's methodology contains a significant flaw in its control of the independent variable. The method states, \"Prepare the series circuit \u2013 connect the batteries together (one battery for 1.5V, two batteries for 3.0V, and so on).\" Using AA batteries as a voltage source is unreliable, as the actual voltage supplied will drop under load and deplete over the course of the experiment, introducing a major uncontrolled variable. This fundamentally undermines the investigation's ability to accurately determine the relationship between voltage and the mass of zinc deposited. While Essay B's self-evaluation section commendably identifies some limitations, the initial design flaw is substantial.\n\nTherefore, because of its superior experimental design, precision, and control of variables, Essay A is the stronger piece of work for the Exploration criterion.",
