  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong proposals for a scientific investigation. Essay A has a clear research question, a solid background section with relevant chemical principles, and a well-structured procedure. However, Essay B demonstrates a superior level of planning and critical thinking. The justification for the chosen concentration of KMnO\u2084, including stoichiometric calculations, shows a deeper engagement with the experimental design. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology section includes a note on adapting the procedure based on preliminary trials, which is indicative of a more thorough and reflective scientific process. The discussion of variables in Essay B is also more detailed, especially the rationale for selecting the specific pH range. While both essays have strong safety sections, Essay B's additional sections on Assumptions, Alternative Methodology, and Extension ideas showcase a more comprehensive and insightful approach to the investigation as a whole. Therefore, Essay B represents a more advanced and well-considered experimental plan.",
