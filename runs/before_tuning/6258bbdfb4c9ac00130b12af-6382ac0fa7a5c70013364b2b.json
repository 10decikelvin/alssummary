  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger approach to experimental design and planning, which are the core components of Criterion B. Its research question is focused and appropriately scoped for an IB investigation. The background information is chemically detailed, thoroughly explaining the principles behind both Acid Value and Saponification Value, directly linking them to the research question. The methodology is exceptionally robust; it is detailed, includes justification for the choice of temperatures and concentrations, and even mentions a preliminary experiment, showcasing a high level of engagement. Most impressively, the variables section is exemplary, with a clear table that not only identifies the controlled variables but also explains precisely how and why each one is controlled.\n\nEssay B, while having a clear and interesting research question comparing two methodologies, exhibits several critical weaknesses in its exploration. The background information is adequate but lacks the chemical depth of Essay A. The most significant flaw lies in the \"Variables\" section, where the student incorrectly identifies the \"Mass of sample\" as the independent variable, when it should be the *source* of the sample (chalk, seashells, rangoli). This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of experimental variables. Furthermore, the methodology for thermal decomposition is weak, relying on a Bunsen burner which, as the student later admits, cannot achieve the necessary temperature for complete decomposition, and the control of this variable is described poorly as just \"using the same Bunsen Burner\".\n\nIn summary, Essay A presents a well-researched, meticulously planned, and methodologically sound investigation. Essay B's plan contains a major conceptual error regarding variables and a significant flaw in one of its chosen methods, making Essay A superior in demonstrating the skills required for Criterion B.",
