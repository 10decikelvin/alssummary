  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a much stronger grasp of experimental design and the requirements of Criterion B. Its research question is exemplary: specific, focused, and outlines the exact independent and dependent variables, as well as the method of measurement (\"What is the activation energy...as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...as measured by a colorimeter\"). In contrast, Essay A's research question is a less effective \"Is it possible...\" style question, and its proposed methodology proves inadequate for answering it, as the author later admits. Essay B's identification and justification of variables are excellent, presented in a clear table with detailed explanations for why and how each is controlled. Essay A, however, fundamentally misidentifies its independent and dependent variables, stating \"Temperature change\" is the independent variable when it is clearly the dependent one. Furthermore, Essay B includes a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which shows a sophisticated approach to refining the methodology, a key aspect of good exploration. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are far more detailed and specific, breaking down the risks and mitigation for each chemical used, whereas Essay A's is more generic.",
