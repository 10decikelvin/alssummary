  "reasoning": "Both essays present very strong Criterion B sections, demonstrating thorough research and planning. Essay A is commendable for its excellent real-world context, linking the investigation to global warming and its ecological impact. The background research clearly explains the chemistry of dissolved oxygen and thoughtfully compares various measurement techniques, providing a strong justification for choosing the Winkler method and for framing the research question as an evaluation of that method's effectiveness. The procedure is clear and the inclusion of learnings from preliminary trials is a sign of good exploratory work.\n\nHowever, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of meticulousness and depth in its experimental design. The research question is exceptionally focused, detailing the substance, independent variable levels, and analytical technique. The tabular presentation of independent, dependent, and a comprehensive list of controlled variables is exemplary in its clarity and detail. Furthermore, the safety precautions section is outstanding; it not only lists the necessary precautions but also explains the specific chemical hazards involved, demonstrating a superior understanding of risk management. While both essays are excellent, Essay B's exhaustive consideration of variables and its detailed, justified safety protocols give it a slight edge in demonstrating a fully considered and well-planned investigation.",
