  "reasoning": "This is a close comparison, as both essays demonstrate strong qualities for Criterion B. Essay B's research question is exceptionally clear and focused: \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas...?\" Its safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are exemplary, referencing specific chemical hazards from CLEAPPS and considering green chemistry principles. However, its methodology has significant weaknesses in the design phase, such as the imprecise dependent variable measurement (\"Using the highest foam point... as a visual cue\") and the difficulty in truly controlling the catalyst's surface area by manually grinding it.\n\nEssay A presents a more sophisticated and ambitious investigation. The research question is slightly long but clearly defines the scope: \"The effects of different oils with different saturation levels on the rate of the Maillard Reaction through the Colorimetric Evaluation of the Advanced Glycation End Products created.\" The background is excellent, linking the practical context of cooking to complex chemistry (AGEs, Lambert-Beer Law) and identifying a genuine gap in the literature (real food vs. model food). The methodology is detailed, multistage, and scientifically sound, involving baking, extraction with a specific buffer, and quantitative analysis via colorimetry. The table of controlled variables is particularly strong, not just listing the variables but explaining in detail *why* their control is crucial to the results. While its risk assessment is brief and lacks environmental considerations, the overall quality of the scientific exploration\u2014the depth of background research, the rigor of the planned methodology, and the thorough consideration of variables\u2014is superior to Essay B's. The methodological flaws in Essay B are more fundamental to the collection of reliable data than the potential issues (like oven hot spots) identified in Essay A.",
