  "reasoning": "Both submissions are of a very high quality and demonstrate a strong understanding of experimental design, fulfilling the requirements for Criterion B exceptionally well.\n\nEssay A presents a very clear and focused research question. The background information is relevant and provides a good chemical basis for both the solubility concept and the titration method being used. A particular strength is the proactive calculation to justify the concentration of KMnO\u2084, which shows excellent foresight and planning. The methodology is detailed and repeatable, and the table of variables clearly explains not just *how* each variable will be controlled, but *why* it is important to do so. The safety, ethical, and environmental considerations are also well-addressed. The inclusion of a section on \"What was changed\" based on preliminary trials is a mark of a well-considered investigation.\n\nEssay B tackles a more complex topic in chemical kinetics. The research question is equally precise and focused. The background information is outstanding, thoroughly explaining the reaction mechanism, the concept of initial rates, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation. This theoretical foundation is directly and explicitly linked to the proposed methodology, which is a key feature of a high-scoring IA. The methodology is detailed, and the explicit \"Preliminary Testing\" section is excellent, showing a process of refinement and troubleshooting. The breakdown of safety concerns by chemical is very thorough and professional.\n\nWhile both essays are excellent, Essay B has a slight edge. The level of theoretical detail and its integration into the experimental design is more sophisticated. The investigation into determining activation energy is conceptually more demanding than the solubility titration, and the student demonstrates a full grasp of the necessary concepts (rate laws, Arrhenius equation) and techniques (colorimetry, graphical analysis) to carry out the investigation successfully. The detailed preliminary testing and the comprehensive safety table also slightly surpass the already high standard set by Essay A.",
