  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-focused research questions and appropriate methodologies, but Essay B demonstrates a superior depth of scientific engagement and a more rigorous experimental design. Essay B's strength lies in its excellent theoretical background, where it not only introduces the Arrhenius equation but also derives the second-order integrated rate law: \"`1/c - 1/c\u2080 = kt`\". This mathematical derivation directly informs and justifies the entire experimental approach of using titration to find concentrations at different times to calculate the rate constant, `k`. In contrast, while Essay A has a good background on the \"diverse ion effect,\" its methodology section omits crucial details about its calibration procedure, failing to list the specific concentrations or masses used to create its calibration curve. Essay B provides a more thorough and justified list of controlled variables, explaining not just what is controlled but also the techniques used, such as reading the burette at eye level to \"prevent parallax error.\" While Essay A's methodology is sound and includes thoughtful steps like using a centrifuge, the lack of calibration details is a significant flaw in a spectrophotometric experiment. Furthermore, Essay B's safety considerations are more specific, identifying multiple hazards such as flammability and corrosivity, whereas Essay A's are more generic. Overall, Essay B's sophisticated integration of theory with a complex experimental design makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
