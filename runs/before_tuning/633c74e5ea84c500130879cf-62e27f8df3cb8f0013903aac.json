  "reasoning": "Essay B is significantly better than Essay A in all aspects of Criterion B: Exploration. Essay B's research question is exceptionally strong: it is focused, specific, and clearly outlines the entire scope of the investigation, including the system being studied, the independent and dependent variables, and the specific temperatures and measurement techniques to be used (\"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone, as determined by analysing the effect of changes in temperature...\"). In contrast, Essay A's research question (\"How do the polyatomic anion and temperature affect the Solubility of Salts...\") is overly broad, attempting to tackle two independent variables without a clear, focused plan.\n\nThe background information in Essay B is comprehensive, relevant, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying chemical principles, including the reaction mechanism, rate law, Beer-Lambert Law, and the Arrhenius equation. This theoretical foundation directly justifies the chosen methodology. Essay A's background, while acceptable, is far more superficial, offering basic definitions without delving into the energetics of dissolution (like lattice and hydration enthalpies) that would properly support its hypothesis.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B excels in its identification and control of variables. They are presented in clear tables with detailed justifications and methods for control. The inclusion of preliminary testing to refine the procedure (e.g., determining the temperature range) showcases a thoughtful and scientific approach. Essay A struggles with this, incorrectly identifying \"Weight of the Salts\" as an independent variable and providing a vague procedure that lacks specific quantities, making it difficult to replicate. Finally, Essay B's safety and environmental considerations are exemplary, detailing specific risks for each chemical and proper disposal methods, whereas Essay A's are generic and incomplete.",
