  "reasoning": "Both essays present exceptionally strong Criterion B sections. Essay A is commended for its clear, focused research question, \"How does the concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate...affect the Young\u2019s Modulus of starch based bioplastic?\", and its excellent methodology. The tables for controlled and, notably, uncontrolled variables demonstrate a high level of critical thinking about the experimental design. Furthermore, the detailed, step-by-step procedure, which incorporates modern technology like the Vernier LabQuest and Tracker software, ensures the experiment is replicable. The risk assessment is also thorough, impressively including ethical considerations regarding the use of food materials.\n\nEssay B, however, demonstrates a slightly more sophisticated and in-depth engagement with the underlying chemical theory. Its research question is highly precise, and the background information section is outstanding, not only explaining the carbonate-bicarbonate system but also introducing both a simple and an advanced formula for buffer capacity, explicitly stating an intention to compare experimental results to a theoretical curve. This shows a deeper level of academic research. The \"Development of Methodology\" section, which justifies the choice of variables and acknowledges adapting a procedure from a university-level experiment, further elevates its quality. While both methodologies are excellent, Essay B's focus on a core, complex chemical concept (buffer capacity) and its rigorous theoretical underpinning give it a marginal advantage in demonstrating a mastery of the subject.\n\nTherefore, while Essay A is excellent in its practical detail and awareness of limitations, Essay B is superior due to its deeper theoretical foundation and more explicit connection between its methodology and established scientific literature.",
