  "reasoning": "Both submissions provide well-structured investigations into how a specific factor affects a property of a food item. Submission A examines the effect of stearin concentration on the heat of combustion of a candle, while Submission B investigates how temperature affects the calcium content of milk. Both have clear research questions, detailed methodologies, and thoughtful discussions of limitations and potential improvements. However, Submission B demonstrates a more thorough and critical analysis. For instance, the discussion of systematic errors in Submission A, such as heat loss, is well-identified, but the proposed solution of a 'heat shield' is somewhat vague. In contrast, Submission B not only identifies potential issues like the interference of milk's natural color with titration indicators but also proposes a concrete solution: diluting the sample. Additionally, Submission B's evaluation of limitations is more comprehensive, covering aspects from the accuracy of the measuring instruments (random error) to the ambient temperature of the lab (systematic error), and suggests specific improvements for each. While both submissions are strong, Submission B's deeper engagement with experimental design and error analysis gives it a slight edge.",
