  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more thorough and meticulously planned investigation, making it superior for Criterion B. Its research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying all key parameters from the outset. A major strength is the \"Pre-test\" section, which demonstrates a genuine scientific process of refining the methodology based on preliminary results; for example, the student adjusted the concentration range because \"the rate of reaction... was similar with a 1.00 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution as it was with a 0.50 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 HCl solution.\" Furthermore, Essay A's treatment of controlled variables is exemplary, using a detailed table that clearly outlines what is controlled, why, and how. The safety and environmental section is also outstanding, featuring a structured risk assessment and a thoughtful discussion on minimizing waste, including calculations to justify the volumes used.\n\nWhile Essay B tackles a more theoretically complex topic involving second-order kinetics and the Arrhenius equation, its execution of the planning stages is less comprehensive. The background section is strong, showing a solid grasp of the underlying mathematics. However, the methodology, while appropriate, is described with less clarity and detail than Essay A's. The controlled variables are identified but lack the systematic \"why\" and \"how\" justification seen in Essay A. The most significant weakness is the safety and environmental section, which is perfunctory and brief, stating only basic precautions like wearing gloves and a minimal note on disposal.\n\nIn conclusion, although Essay B is more ambitious in its chemical theory, Essay A demonstrates a far more robust, thoughtful, and complete approach to the exploration and design of the experiment, which is the core focus of Criterion B.",
