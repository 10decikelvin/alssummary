  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of quality for Criterion B, but Essay A presents a slightly more robust and well-conceived experimental exploration. Essay A's research question, focusing on the effect of oil saturation on the Maillard reaction, is highly focused and establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship to be investigated. Its methodology is complex, involving baking and chemical extraction, and the table of controlled variables is exceptionally thorough, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of the numerous factors that could affect a biochemical process like baking (e.g., \"Baking Temperature and Time,\" \"Dough Fermentation Time & Environment\"). The justification for the research\u2014addressing a gap by using \"real food\" instead of \"model foods\"\u2014is a strong example of personal and scientific engagement.\n\nEssay B is also excellent, with a very detailed background section that explains the complex chemistry of milk components and complexometric titrations. A standout feature is its inclusion of a table for \"Uncontrolled variables,\" which shows a high degree of critical thinking about the experiment's limitations from the outset. However, its research question is correlational rather than experimental, investigating a \"quantitative relation\" between nutrient content (taken from labels) and ion concentration. This reliance on manufacturer-provided data for key variables (protein and fat content) makes the experimental design slightly weaker than that of Essay A, where the independent variable is directly controlled by the student's choice of oils. While Essay B's risk assessment is more comprehensive, Essay A's overall experimental design and control of a more complex procedure give it a marginal edge.",
