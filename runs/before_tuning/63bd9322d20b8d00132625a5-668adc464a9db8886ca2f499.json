  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of experimental design and data analysis within the context of their chosen investigations. However, essay B is slightly stronger due to its more thorough and well-explained methodology, particularly in its handling of potential sources of error and the justification of its procedures.\n\nEssay A presents a clear investigation into the effect of stearin on the combustion of candles. The research question is well-defined, and the experiment appears well-structured. The student identifies relevant variables and acknowledges the limitations of their experiment, offering sensible improvements. However, the discussion of the results is somewhat brief, and while it correctly identifies a significant discrepancy between experimental and literature values, it doesn't delve deeply into the potential reasons for this beyond mentioning heat loss. The explanation for why stearin should increase the enthalpy of combustion is sound, but the connection back to the wildly divergent experimental results could be stronger.\n\nEssay B, on the other hand, excels in its detailed procedural description and thoughtful consideration of potential issues. The student proactively determines the concentration of the bleach through titration, demonstrating a robust understanding of chemical principles and practical laboratory skills. This foresight significantly strengthens the reliability of their independent variable. The \"Strengths and Weaknesses\" section is more detailed, providing specific examples of how experimental design choices (like using a lid on the cuvette) helped mitigate errors. The connection between the theoretical concepts (collision theory, Beer-Lamber Law) and the experimental design is more explicitly and clearly articulated. While both essays present clear data and analysis, the meticulous approach and deeper chemical reasoning in Essay B give it a slight edge. The inclusion of the chemical equations for the reactions involved further demonstrates a more comprehensive grasp of the topic.\n\nIn short, while both are good examples of experimental write-ups, Essay B's more rigorous methodology, proactive problem-solving (titration), and more detailed explanation of its experimental choices make it the superior piece.",
