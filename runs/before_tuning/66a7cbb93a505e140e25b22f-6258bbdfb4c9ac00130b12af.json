  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly higher level of exploration and planning compared to Essay A. While Essay A presents a competent and clear investigation into antacids, its scope and depth are standard for this level. Essay B, on the other hand, tackles a much more chemically complex topic involving the quality of cooking oil, employing sophisticated techniques like reflux and non-aqueous titrations. The methodology in Essay B is exceptionally detailed, outlining not just the procedure but also the preparation and standardization of reagents, which shows a thorough understanding and planning process. Furthermore, Essay B's treatment of variables is exemplary, presenting them in a structured table that explains both *how* and *why* each variable is controlled, considering subtle factors like \"Microbial Contamination\" and \"Light\". The risk assessment in Essay B is also far more comprehensive, identifying a wider range of specific hazards (e.g., \"Flammable liquids,\" \"bursting of flask\" during reflux) with detailed, practical safety precautions. In contrast, Essay A's methodology and safety considerations are adequate but far less detailed and ambitious. The justification for methodological choices in Essay B, such as using a Soxhlet apparatus for heating and selecting specific titrant concentrations, further showcases a superior level of critical thinking and engagement with the experimental design.",
