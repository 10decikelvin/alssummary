  "reasoning": "Both essays present viable investigations for the IB Chemistry IA. However, Essay A demonstrates a significantly stronger grasp of the requirements for the Exploration criterion.\n\nEssay A's research question is exceptionally well-defined, specifying the exact concentrations of the independent variable (NaCl) and the units for both variables. The background section is comprehensive and scientifically rigorous, linking the investigation to a real-world context (global warming and ocean salinity) and then delving deeply into the underlying chemical principles. It thoroughly explains concepts like polarity, dipole-induced-dipole forces, the salting-out effect, hydration, and the complex redox chemistry of the Winkler method, complete with relevant equations. The methodology is detailed and precise, including specific instructions for preparing standard solutions, which demonstrates thorough planning. The identification and justification of controlled variables in a clear table format is excellent.\n\nEssay B, while having a good comparative research question, falls short in its background information. The context is largely personal, and the chemical explanations are limited to listing the main reaction equations without much elaboration on the principles of back titration or thermal decomposition. The methodology for the titration is reasonably clear, but the plan for thermal decomposition using a Bunsen burner is flawed, as a Bunsen burner typically cannot reach the high, stable temperatures required for complete decomposition of CaCO\u2083, a weakness the student themselves later identifies in their evaluation. While this shows good critical thinking, it also points to a less robust initial experimental design compared to Essay A. The variables are identified, but the description of the dependent variable for the titration is imprecise.\n\nOverall, Essay A's superior theoretical background, meticulous methodology, and precisely formulated research question make it the stronger example for Criterion B. It reflects a deeper level of scientific inquiry and preparation.",
