  "reasoning": "Essay A is the stronger submission for Criterion B. Its research question is highly focused and ambitious, investigating two independent variables (salinity and temperature) and their effect on dissolved oxygen. The rationale provided is excellent, linking the investigation directly to the significant global issue of climate change, which demonstrates strong personal engagement and scientific curiosity. Furthermore, the background section thoroughly explains the complex chemistry of the Winkler titration and provides a well-reasoned justification for choosing this method over alternatives. Essay A's treatment of variables is exemplary; it not only identifies a comprehensive list of controlled variables but also clearly explains *why* each must be controlled and *how* this will be achieved, demonstrating a deep understanding of the experimental system.\n\nEssay B, while still a competent piece of work, is comparatively weaker. Its rationale is based on simple personal curiosity (\"My mother insisted I keep the milk refrigerated\") and lacks the broader scientific context seen in Essay A. Although Essay B identifies relevant variables, the explanations for why they need to be controlled are often simplistic (e.g., \"The number of calcium ions in the milk will be increased if the amount of sample used increases.\"). The methodology, a complexometric back-titration, is appropriate, but the explanation could be clearer. Critically, Essay B includes a detailed \"Limitations\" and \"Improvements\" table within the methodology section; this content is more appropriate for the Evaluation (Criterion C) and disrupts the flow of the Exploration section. While both essays provide adequate safety information, Essay A's chemical-by-chemical breakdown is more systematic and thorough.",
