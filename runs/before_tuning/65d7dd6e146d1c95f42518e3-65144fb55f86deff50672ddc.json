  "reasoning": "Both submissions aim to investigate the effect of a property of a metal ion on the color of a complex ion. Both labs have well-defined variables and a detailed procedure. Both labs correctly identify that the color of the complex is due to d-orbital splitting and have included a theoretical basis for this connection. However, Lab B's hypothesis is better supported by their theory, as they clearly link the ionic radius to the energy of splitting. Lab A makes a hand-wavy claim based on ligand field strength. Lab B also has a much more in-depth and insightful evaluation section, considering a larger number of systematic errors. The only weakness mentioned in Lab A is parallax error, which is a fairly superficial error to be discussed in a lab report. Finally, Lab B is far more precise with their language and calculations. For instance, Lab B correctly mentions the concentration of the ammonia solution and provides a sample calculation for how to dilute it to the appropriate concentration. Lab A does not specify the concentration of the ammonia solution they used. Therefore, Lab B is the stronger investigation.",
