  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and scientifically sound investigations. Essay A provides a clear and focused research question with a strong theoretical background explaining solubility, intermolecular forces, and the Winkler titration method. The procedure is detailed and replicable, and the safety considerations are thorough and specific to the chemicals used. Essay B also has a well-defined research question, demonstrating excellent personal engagement by linking the topic to a passion for cooking. Its background section is robust, explaining the Maillard reaction and the principles of colorimetry effectively. The methodology is complex, involving multiple stages from dough preparation to chemical extraction and analysis, and the table of controlled variables is exceptionally detailed, showing a high level of critical thought about the experimental design. While both are very strong, Essay B demonstrates a slightly higher level of scientific inquiry and originality. It identifies a specific gap in existing literature (real food vs. model food systems) and designs a sophisticated experiment to investigate it. The self-evaluation section, while technically outside the scope of just the plan, reveals a deep and critical understanding of the experimental limitations, which strengthens the overall quality of the exploration and planning phase. Essay A is a very competent execution of a more standard experiment, whereas Essay B tackles a more novel and challenging topic with impressive thoroughness.",
