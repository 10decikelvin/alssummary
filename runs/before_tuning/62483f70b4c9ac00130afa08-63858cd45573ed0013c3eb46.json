  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more sophisticated and well-justified exploration, making it the stronger of the two. Its research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is evaluative and demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking than Essay B's more standard investigative question. The background research in Essay A is exceptionally thorough; it not only explains the underlying chemistry of dissolved oxygen with reference to Le Chatelier's Principle but also critically reviews multiple methods for its measurement before detailing the complex multi-step redox reactions of the Winkler method. This depth provides a strong, logical foundation for the chosen methodology.\n\nEssay B is also a strong piece of work, with a clearly stated research question and well-defined variables presented in a clear table. The student shows personal engagement by attempting a non-standard analysis of rate (\"interpreting the rate to be \u0394t/\u0394m\") and by justifying the use of six data points and two dependent variable measurements (150mL and 200mL of gas). However, its background section is less comprehensive than Essay A's, covering the basics of catalysis without exploring the specific mechanism of MnO\u2082 in detail. Furthermore, the methodology, while creative, is less technically demanding than the Winkler titration in Essay A. Essay A's procedure is also strengthened by its explicit mention and application of learnings from preliminary trials, a key feature of a well-planned investigation. Finally, both essays handle safety and environmental considerations well, but Essay A's specific, chemical-by-chemical risk assessment is slightly more detailed and rigorous.",
