  "reasoning": "Both submissions demonstrate a strong grasp of the scientific process required for the Exploration criterion. Both present clear, focused research questions with identifiable independent and dependent variables. They also both provide relevant background information, detailed methodologies, and appropriate safety considerations.\n\nHowever, Essay B displays a greater depth of understanding and personal engagement with the scientific concepts. The research question, \"How does the change in acid catalyst (HCl and H2SO4) affect the activation energy of the iodination of propanone?\", is more sophisticated as it investigates a fundamental kinetic parameter rather than just a concentration change. The background section is particularly strong, effectively linking concepts like acid strength (pKa), reaction rates, catalysis, and the Arrhenius equation to build a logical and well-supported hypothesis. The methodology for Essay B is also more complex, requiring multiple trials across a range of temperatures to gather data for an Arrhenius plot, which is a more demanding experimental design than the titrations in Essay A.\n\nWhile Essay A presents a very well-structured and replicable experiment, its scope is more standard. Its \"Evaluation\" section is good, but the \"Limitations\" in Essay B's evaluation section show a slightly more critical and insightful reflection on the experimental procedure, especially regarding the choice of glassware and its impact on uncertainty (\"The uncertainty found was around \u00b19%. The reason for this large uncertainty is due to the fact that I added such tiny amounts of volumes of the reagents from the burettes... a graduated pipette could have been used instead\").\n\nTherefore, due to its more advanced theoretical framework, more complex experimental design, and slightly more insightful self-evaluation, Essay B is the stronger of the two.",
