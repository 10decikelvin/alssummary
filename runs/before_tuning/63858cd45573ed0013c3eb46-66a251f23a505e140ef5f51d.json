  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and sophisticated approach to Criterion B. The background information in Essay B is exceptionally strong, integrating high-level concepts like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation to provide a deep theoretical foundation for the investigation. This contrasts with Essay A's background, which, while solid and relevant, covers more foundational concepts of catalysis. Essay B's methodology is also superior; it details a more complex two-part experimental design (calibration curve and equilibrium study) and crucially includes a section on \"Preliminary experiments.\" This section showcases a process of refinement and problem-solving (e.g., addressing the color of Fe\u00b3\u207a ions), which is a hallmark of excellent scientific exploration. While Essay A's methodology is clear and replicable, its unconventional definition of rate (`\u0394t/\u0394m`) is a minor weakness, and it lacks the documented trial-and-error process evident in Essay B. Both essays have excellent, detailed variable tables and strong safety considerations, but Essay B's control of variables and risk assessment (specifically noting the potential for cyanide gas production) is slightly more nuanced and comprehensive. Overall, Essay B presents a more ambitious investigation supported by a more rigorous and well-documented exploration phase.",
