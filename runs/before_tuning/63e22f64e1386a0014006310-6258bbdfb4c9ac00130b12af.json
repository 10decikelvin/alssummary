  "reasoning": "The reasoning for the decision is as follows:\n\nBoth essays present well-structured and detailed explorations. Essay B is notably more ambitious in its chemical techniques, proposing two separate titrimetric analyses (acid value and saponification value) which require complex procedures like reflux and solution standardization. Its coverage of controlled variables, including subtle factors like \"Moisture\" and \"Microbial Contamination,\" and its comprehensive risk assessment that includes ethical and environmental considerations, are exemplary. However, Essay B is undermined by several significant flaws in its exploration. The research question is poorly phrased, reading more like a title than a focused question. More critically, the background information admits a failure to formulate a hypothesis for the saponification value, stating it \"cannot be hypothesized due to lack of availability of research,\" which indicates a gap in the background investigation. The most significant issue is a fundamental error in the methodology, repeatedly referencing the use of a \"soxhlet apparatus\" for controlled heating, which is incorrect as a Soxhlet apparatus is designed for solid-liquid extraction, not for precise temperature control of a liquid sample.\n\nEssay A, while based on a more common calorimetry experiment, presents a superior exploration overall. Its two-part research question is exceptionally clear, focused, and sets up a sophisticated comparative investigation into the effects of both carbon chain length and isomerism on combustion enthalpy. The background information is thorough and directly supports the hypothesis and methodology. The experimental design is logical, appropriate for the research question, and free from the kind of critical errors seen in Essay B. The identification and justification of controlled variables are robust, demonstrating strong experimental design principles. While its safety section could have been expanded to include environmental considerations, the coherence, clarity, and scientific soundness of the entire proposed investigation in Essay A make it a stronger example of Criterion B. A well-designed and logical plan for a standard experiment is superior to an ambitious but flawed one.",
