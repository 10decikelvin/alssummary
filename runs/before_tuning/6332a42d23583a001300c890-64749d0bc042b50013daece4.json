  "reasoning": "Essay A is better as it demonstrates a more focused and methodologically sound approach to the investigation, which is central to Criterion B. Its research question, \"Is there a relationship between the rate constant (k) and the temperature of the reaction between oxalic acid and potassium permanganate? Determination of the activation energy,\" is clear, singular, and appropriately complex for an IB investigation. The methodology is directly and logically designed to answer this single question by manipulating one independent variable (temperature) to measure its effect on the dependent variable (rate constant). The background information provides a solid theoretical foundation using concepts like collision theory and the Arrhenius equation.\n\nEssay B, while demonstrating impressive depth in its background research and control of variables, is built on a fundamentally flawed research question: \"How does varying salinity... and temperature... affect the amount of dissolved oxygen...\". An IB IA should investigate a single independent variable to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship. By attempting to investigate two independent variables, the scope becomes too broad and the experimental design is compromised. Although Essay B's discussion of controlled variables and safety considerations is exceptionally detailed and shows a high level of awareness, this cannot compensate for the core weakness in its experimental design. Essay A's project is a more complete and coherent demonstration of the scientific process from conception to execution.",
