  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a substantially higher level of quality for Criterion B. The research question is more precise, specifying the exact temperatures to be investigated. The background information in Essay B is exceptionally strong, as it not only explains the core reaction but also integrates advanced concepts like Gibbs free energy and the Van't Hoff equation, providing a robust theoretical framework that directly justifies the investigation's purpose and methodology. In contrast, Essay A's background is sufficient but less sophisticated.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B's methodology is more rigorous and meticulously planned. The inclusion of \"Preliminary experiments\" to troubleshoot issues and determine the time to equilibrium shows a proactive and scientific approach. The controlled variables are presented in an exemplary table with clear justifications, far exceeding the simple list provided in Essay A. The procedure in Essay B is also more detailed, specifying equipment uncertainties and logical steps for both a calibration curve and the main experiment. Finally, the safety, ethical, and environmental considerations in Essay B are specific to each chemical used and far more comprehensive than the generic and minimal statements in Essay A. While Essay A presents a competent and clear plan, Essay B's submission is exemplary in its scientific depth, rigor, and attention to detail.",
