  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and thoughtful explorations of their respective research questions. Essay B is commendable for its clear personal connection to pharmacology, its detailed methodology including dilution calculations, and a thorough consideration of variables and safety. The inclusion of preliminary testing to refine the concentration range and observation time demonstrates good scientific practice.\n\nHowever, Essay A is superior in its scientific depth and rigor. Its research question is more ambitious, aiming to determine a fundamental kinetic parameter (activation energy) rather than simply observing a relationship between concentration and rate. The background section is exceptionally strong, linking the reaction mechanism, rate law, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation to create a robust theoretical framework for the experiment. This level of detail shows a deeper understanding of the underlying chemistry. Furthermore, Essay A's methodology, while complex, shows a sophisticated approach to controlling temperature, and its preliminary testing led to crucial modifications, such as forgoing cuvette caps at higher temperatures\u2014a nuanced observation that strengthens the procedure's validity. While both are excellent, Essay A's combination of a more challenging research question, more advanced theoretical background, and a well-justified, refined methodology makes it the stronger example of Criterion B.",
