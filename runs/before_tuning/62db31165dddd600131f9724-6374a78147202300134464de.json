  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is based on the completeness and thoroughness of the components required for Criterion B. Essay B, despite some minor flaws in its phrasing, presents a complete and robust exploration plan. Its research question, \"How has concentration affected enthalpy change...\", is functional, and its background information is strong, impressively including Gibbs Free Energy calculations to justify the reaction's feasibility. Most importantly, Essay B provides a detailed methodology with clearly defined independent, dependent, and controlled variables, a full apparatus list with uncertainties, a step-by-step procedure, and a comprehensive risk assessment covering safety, environmental, and ethical aspects.\n\nEssay A, in contrast, is fundamentally incomplete. While its research question, background, and hypothesis are exceptionally well-written and scientifically justified, it entirely omits the core components of the exploration. The \"Variables\" section is just a header, and the methodology and safety considerations are completely absent from the provided text. A strong introduction cannot compensate for the lack of an actual experimental plan. Therefore, because Criterion B explicitly assesses the methodology, variables, and safety protocols, Essay B is demonstrably superior as it successfully addresses all these requirements, presenting a full and viable investigation. Essay A fails to provide the necessary evidence for assessment in these critical areas.",
