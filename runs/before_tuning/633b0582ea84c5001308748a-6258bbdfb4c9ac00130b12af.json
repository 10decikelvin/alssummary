  "reasoning": "The decision is a close one, as both essays demonstrate significant strengths in different areas of Criterion B. Essay B presents an exceptionally thorough and well-designed experimental methodology. The detailed table of controlled variables, including justifications for *how* and *why* each is controlled, is exemplary. Furthermore, its risk assessment is comprehensive, meticulously covering safety, ethical, and environmental considerations with specific, actionable precautions. However, Essay B falters significantly in its background research and hypothesis formation. The student explicitly states, \"Effect of increasing temperature on Saponification Value (SV) cannot be hypothesized due to lack of availability of research,\" which reveals a critical gap in their exploration and understanding of the underlying chemical principles.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A demonstrates a more coherent and scientifically robust exploration from start to finish. The research questions are clear and focused, and the background information provides a strong theoretical foundation, effectively linking concepts like intermolecular forces and bond energies to the dependent variables. The hypotheses are logical, well-reasoned, and directly derived from this background theory. While its methodology is for a database investigation and it lacks a formal risk assessment section (a less critical omission for a non-practical IA), the overall scientific thought process is more complete and sound. Essay A's ability to construct a solid theoretical framework and use it to make predictions outweighs the superior procedural detail of Essay B, whose foundational research has a notable weakness.",
