  "reasoning": "Both essays present well-structured and focused explorations with clear research questions and personal engagement. Essay B is commendable for its detailed methodology section, particularly the excellent table outlining the controlled variables with justifications (\"Table 1 How and why the variables were controlled\"). This demonstrates a thorough consideration of experimental design. Similarly, its plan to create a calibration curve and use a centrifuge to remove sediment are signs of strong practical planning. However, Essay B's methodology contains a critical scientific flaw; it proposes using a \"0.6M CaSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O\" solution, which is physically impossible as calcium sulfate is a sparingly soluble salt with a solubility closer to 0.015 M. This fundamental error undermines the entire viability of the proposed experiment.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A proposes a database investigation that is scientifically sound, coherent, and meticulously planned. The background information provides a clear and detailed theoretical basis for the hypotheses, explicitly linking concepts like London dispersion forces to boiling points. The methodology is highly specific, naming reliable databases (NIST, HSDB) and showing forethought by describing how data inconsistencies like unit conversions and ranges will be handled. Furthermore, the control of variables in Essay A is sophisticated, as it specifies the use of \"only linear primary alcohols\" to eliminate the confounding effects of isomerism, a crucial consideration for a database study of this nature. While Essay B shows good procedural thinking, Essay A's flawless scientific logic and robust, viable plan make it the superior example of Criterion B.",
