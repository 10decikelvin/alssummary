  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a high level of achievement for Criterion B, featuring well-defined research questions, thorough background research, and detailed methodologies. Essay B's theoretical underpinning is particularly strong, effectively incorporating the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and multiple formulas for buffer capacity to establish a sophisticated scientific context. Its use of tables to present controlled variables and the risk assessment is exceptionally clear and well-organized.\n\nHowever, Essay A presents a slightly more complete and well-rounded exploration. Its research question is grounded in a strong personal narrative that is referenced throughout the justification of its variables, such as choosing the voltage range based on advice for \"amateur jewellers.\" The methodology in Essay A is highly detailed and replicable, and it importantly mentions conducting \"preliminary trials,\" which is a hallmark of excellent scientific exploration. Critically, Essay A provides a significantly more detailed and actionable plan for safety and environmental considerations, offering specific methods for waste disposal like neutralizing sulphuric acid with sodium carbonate. In contrast, Essay B's environmental section is brief and less thorough, stating that the low concentration will have \"no significant environmental effects\" without further justification. This superior attention to the practical and safety aspects of the entire experimental process gives Essay A the edge.",
