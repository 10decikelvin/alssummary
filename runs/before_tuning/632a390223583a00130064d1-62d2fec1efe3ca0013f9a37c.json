  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong plans for investigation. However, Essay A demonstrates a more thorough and robust approach to the experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B.\n\nEssay B has a very clear research question and a solid theoretical background that directly links the concepts of acid strength (pKa), reaction rates, and activation energy via the Arrhenius equation. This provides a strong foundation for its hypothesis. However, its methodology has a significant weakness: the dependent variable (reaction rate) is determined by timing a color change by eye. This is a subjective and imprecise method that introduces considerable random error, a point the student acknowledges in their evaluation.\n\nEssay A, while slightly weaker in its chemical explanation for *why* sodium bicarbonate affects the bioplastic's properties, excels in the practical aspects of its experimental design. The procedure is meticulously detailed, with specific quantities and clear steps. The identification and control of variables are comprehensive, even including a thoughtful discussion of uncontrolled variables like the non-uniform thickness of the plastic. Most importantly, the method for measuring the dependent variable (Young's Modulus) is sophisticated, utilizing a force sensor and video analysis software (Tracker) for precise and objective data collection. This demonstrates a higher level of engagement with designing a reliable experiment. The inclusion of ethical considerations regarding the use of food materials also shows a broader scope of thought.\n\nOverall, while Essay B has a stronger theoretical justification, Essay A's superior experimental methodology, with its greater attention to controlling variables and employing precise measurement techniques, makes it the stronger example for Criterion B.",
