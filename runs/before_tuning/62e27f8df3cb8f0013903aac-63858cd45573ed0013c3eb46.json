  "reasoning": "Essay A is the superior submission, primarily due to its more sophisticated research question and the depth of its theoretical background, which demonstrates a stronger command of chemical kinetics. The research question, \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\", is highly specific, quantitative, and directly linked to a core concept of the IB Chemistry syllabus. The background information comprehensively covers the reaction mechanism, rate laws, the Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation, creating a robust theoretical foundation for the experiment. This level of detail shows a thorough understanding of the principles being investigated. The methodology, while containing potential flaws regarding temperature control, utilizes precise instrumentation like a colorimeter, which is appropriate for the level of study.\n\nEssay B, while competent, presents a less ambitious investigation. Its research question, \"How does the mass of manganese (IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) catalyst used impact the time taken to evolve standard volumes of oxygen gas...\", is clear but less complex. The background information is adequate but lacks the depth of Essay A's, particularly regarding reaction mechanisms and kinetic theory. A notable weakness in Essay B is its unconventional and somewhat confusing interpretation of rate as \"\u0394t / \u0394m\", which deviates from the standard chemical definition (change in concentration or volume over time). Although the experimental design is practical and the control of variables is well-considered (especially the attempt to control surface area), the theoretical framework and the sophistication of the scientific inquiry in Essay A are significantly stronger.\n\nIn conclusion, Essay A demonstrates a deeper engagement with the subject matter, a more challenging and focused research question, and a superior theoretical underpinning, making it the better example of Criterion B despite some practical challenges in its proposed methodology.",
