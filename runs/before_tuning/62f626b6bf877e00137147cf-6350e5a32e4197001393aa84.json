  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "The decision is unequivocally in favor of Essay B, which demonstrates a far superior understanding and execution of the requirements for Criterion B. Essay B's research question, \"How does the increase in Concentration of the salt Sodium Chloride affect the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen... when temperature is kept constant?\", is focused, clear, and establishes a testable relationship between well-defined variables. In contrast, Essay A's research question is awkwardly phrased, starting with the method (\"Using Complexometric Titration will determine...\") rather than the scientific query itself.\n\nThe most significant difference lies in the background information and methodology. Essay B provides extensive, relevant, and cited background on dissolved oxygen, the factors affecting it, and a detailed theoretical explanation of the Winkler Method, including the chemical equations. Essay A's introduction is a single, generic sentence about titration, offering no scientific context for the experiment. Furthermore, Essay B's methodology is comprehensive, repeatable, and logically structured, detailing the preparation of solutions and the procedures for two different measurement techniques. Essay A's methodology is incomplete, starting at step 6, and crucially fails to explain how the independent variable (the expiration date of milk) will be managed or tested.\n\nFinally, Essay B excels in its identification and justification of variables, presenting them in a clear table and explaining why each controlled variable must be kept constant. Essay A implies its variables in the research question but fails to identify or discuss any controlled variables, which is a major methodological flaw. While both essays contain adequate safety assessments, Essay B's is more thorough and thoughtfully includes specific environmental and ethical considerations, making it a comprehensively well-planned investigation that is far superior to Essay A.",
