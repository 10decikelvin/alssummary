  "decision": "essay2",
  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a significantly stronger and more complete exploration of its topic, making it the superior essay for Criterion B. Its research question is highly specific and ambitious, investigating the relationship between ionic radii of period 4 transition metals and d-orbital splitting energy, which shows a sophisticated level of chemical inquiry. The background section is exceptionally thorough, not only explaining the complex principles of crystal field theory and ligand exchange but also justifying the choice of reagents with reference to the spectrochemical series. In contrast, Essay A's research question, \"What is the effect of temperature on the concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) within lemon juice?\", is a very common and less challenging topic. While Essay A's background provides a solid explanation of the redox titration involved, it lacks the depth and complexity seen in Essay B.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B presents a complete and detailed methodology that is clearly replicable, alongside a robust safety, ethical, and environmental considerations section that addresses specific chemical risks like ammonium hydroxide toxicity. Essay A is critically incomplete in the provided text, as it is missing its methodology, a populated variables table, and any safety considerations, which are essential components of Criterion B. Essay B also includes a dedicated \"Assumptions\" section, which demonstrates a high level of critical thinking about the experimental design's limitations before the experiment is even conducted. This proactive identification of potential issues, such as the geometry of copper complexes, elevates Essay B's exploration well beyond the standard. Therefore, due to its complexity, completeness, and depth of scientific thought, Essay B is clearly the better submission.",
