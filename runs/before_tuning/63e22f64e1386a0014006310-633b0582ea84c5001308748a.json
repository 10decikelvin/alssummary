  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a significantly more robust and well-developed exploration. Its research question is highly focused and ambitious, investigating two distinct variables: the effect of carbon chain length and the effect of isomerism (primary, secondary, tertiary) on the enthalpy of combustion. In contrast, Essay B's research question is simpler and is addressed through a database investigation, which inherently involves less complex methodological planning. Essay A's methodology is a key strength; it is a detailed, replicable, hands-on experimental procedure. The section on variables is exemplary, with a comprehensive list of controlled variables accompanied by clear justifications and methods of control, such as using the same calorimeter and stopping the heating at a consistent temperature of 30\u00b0C. Essay B's methodology is appropriate for a database study but lacks this depth, simply stating it will use primary alcohols and listing the databases. Furthermore, Essay A includes a thorough and specific safety assessment, identifying multiple risks and outlining concrete protective measures, which is a crucial component of experimental design that is absent in Essay B. While Essay B provides an excellent real-world context regarding biofuels, Essay A's meticulous planning and experimental design better fulfill the requirements of Criterion B.",
