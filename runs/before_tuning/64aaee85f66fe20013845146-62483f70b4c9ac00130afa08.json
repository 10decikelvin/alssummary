  "reasoning": "Essay B is demonstrably superior in its fulfillment of Criterion B due to its sophisticated research question, exceptional background research, and thorough consideration of all procedural aspects. The research question, \"To what extent is the Winkler Method a good way of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in tap water at varying temperatures?\", is evaluative and analytical, showing a higher level of critical thinking than Essay A's descriptive question. Essay B's background is outstanding; it links the investigation to a significant real-world issue (global warming), explains complex underlying chemical principles like Le Chatelier's Principle and Henry's Law, and meticulously details the multi-step Winkler titration mechanism. Furthermore, its risk assessment is comprehensive, identifying specific chemical hazards and addressing environmental disposal, an aspect completely missing in Essay A despite the use of the hazardous solvent dichloromethane.\n\nEssay A presents a competent and well-structured investigation. Its research question is clear and focused, the variables are very well-defined in a clear table, and the procedure for caffeine extraction is appropriate. However, its background information is relatively superficial and lacks the scientific depth seen in Essay B. The safety precautions in Essay A are adequate but less formal and comprehensive than Essay B's risk assessment. The most significant advantage for Essay B is its deep intellectual engagement with the topic, justifying the methodology by comparing it to alternatives and grounding the entire study in a contemporary scientific context, which is a hallmark of an excellent exploration.",
