  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong Criterion B sections, but Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and scientifically rigorous approach to the exploration phase. Essay B's research question is exceptionally clear and focused: \"What is the activation energy, in kJ mol-1, of the 1M sulfuric acid-catalysed iodination of 1M propanone...\". This precision is mirrored in its background section, which provides a detailed theoretical foundation, explaining the reaction mechanism, rate law, Beer-Lambert law, and the Arrhenius equation. A key strength of Essay B is its inclusion of a \"Preliminary Testing\" section, which justifies the chosen temperature range and procedural modifications, showcasing a mature and iterative approach to experimental design. Furthermore, its safety and environmental considerations are exemplary, detailing specific risks for each chemical and proper disposal methods.\n\nEssay A's topic is more creative and ambitious, aiming to investigate the Maillard reaction in a real-food context, which shows excellent personal engagement. Its background information is relevant, and it successfully identifies a gap in the existing literature. The tables outlining the variables are also very well-structured and detailed, clearly explaining the \"what,\" \"how,\" and \"why\" for each controlled variable. However, Essay A's safety assessment is comparatively superficial, listing only general hazards like \"Oven (High Temperatures)\" without the chemical-specific detail seen in Essay B. While the methodology is detailed, it has more inherent uncontrolled variables (e.g., \"hot spots\" in a home oven, as the student acknowledges), which slightly weakens the experimental design compared to the more controlled chemical kinetics experiment in Essay B.\n\nUltimately, Essay B is superior due to its meticulous attention to detail across all aspects of the criterion. The combination of a precise research question, a deeply theoretical background, a refined methodology supported by preliminary testing, and an outstanding risk assessment makes it a more robust and well-planned investigation.",
