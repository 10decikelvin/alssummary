  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a much stronger and more thoroughly considered experimental design, which is the core of Criterion B. Its two-part research question is ambitious yet focused, investigating both carbon chain length and isomerism on combustion enthalpy. The identification and control of variables in Essay A are exemplary; the table format that includes the reason for controlling each variable and the specific method of control (e.g., \"The same calorimeter was used for every trial\") shows a high level of methodological rigor. Furthermore, the procedure is detailed, appropriate for the question, and the safety considerations are specific, linking tangible risks like \"Spillage of alcohols\" to precise protective measures.\n\nEssay B, while having a good research question and relevant background, contains significant flaws in its methodology and control of variables. The choice of a direct titration for a solid, partially insoluble antacid tablet is a critical design error; a back-titration would have been a far more accurate and appropriate technique, a point a high-level student should recognize. The justification for not controlling the mass of the tablets\u2014\"to give a realistic answer\"\u2014undermines the scientific principle of a fair test and makes direct comparison of the active ingredients difficult. While Essay B's safety and background sections are adequate, they do not match the depth and specificity demonstrated in Essay A. Overall, Essay A's superior experimental design, meticulous control of variables, and detailed planning make it the clear winner for Criterion B.",
