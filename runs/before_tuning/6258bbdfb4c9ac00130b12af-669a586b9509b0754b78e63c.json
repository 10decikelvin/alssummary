  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong explorations, but Essay A demonstrates a higher level of chemical sophistication and methodological rigor, making it the better submission for Criterion B. Essay B's research question is exceptionally well-formulated, \"What is the average rate of reaction (cm^3 s^-1) of 0.5 g of crushed antacids...in HCl solutions of varying concentrations...\", providing a model of clarity and focus. Its methodology is also well-justified with a pre-test that informed the final design. However, the experimental technique of collecting gas evolved from a reaction is a standard and relatively straightforward kinetics experiment.\n\nIn contrast, Essay A tackles a more complex investigation involving two distinct analytical techniques: a standard titration for Acid Value and a more demanding back-titration following a reflux procedure for Saponification Value. The methodology in Essay A is meticulously detailed, including crucial steps like preparing and standardizing reagents (\"Preparing and standardizing molarity of potassium hydroxide solution...\"), which demonstrates a superior understanding of analytical precision. Furthermore, Essay A's \"Justification for methodology\" section provides a robust defense for the choice of temperatures, concentrations, and sample sizes. While both essays have excellent sections on variables and safety, the greater complexity and technical challenge of Essay A's procedure ultimately showcase a more advanced and thorough exploration appropriate for the IB Chemistry level.",
