  "reasoning": "Both submissions are of a very high quality and demonstrate a strong understanding of experimental design. Essay B is particularly commendable for its originality, personal engagement, and the complexity of its procedure, which links chemistry to a real-world application like baking. Its background information on the Maillard reaction and the use of a colorimeter is thorough and well-researched. However, Essay A demonstrates a more complete and meticulous approach to the \"Exploration\" criterion as a whole. Its table of controlled variables is exemplary, not just listing the variables but also detailing how and, crucially, *why* they need to be controlled. Furthermore, Essay A includes a dedicated and well-considered section on safety, ethical, and environmental considerations, which is a key requirement of the criteria and is missing from Essay B (which only addresses safety). While Essay B's topic is more ambitious, Essay A's meticulous planning and explicit attention to all rubric components, especially the justification for the concentration of the titrant and the thoroughness of the safety and environmental plan, make it the stronger example of scientific planning. The evaluation section in both is strong, but Essay A's comprehensive approach from start to finish gives it the edge.",
