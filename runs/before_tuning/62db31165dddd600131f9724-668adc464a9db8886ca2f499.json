  "reasoning": "Both essays present strong foundations for a chemical investigation, but Essay B demonstrates a more thorough and meticulous approach to experimental design, which is central to Criterion B. Essay A's strength lies in its excellent background section, which clearly connects the biological importance of Vitamin C to the specific chemical principles of redox titration. The research question is focused, and the hypothesis is well-supported by relevant theory like the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. However, the provided text for Essay A is incomplete, lacking the detailed methodology and safety precautions.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B provides a comprehensive and exemplary plan. Its research question, while slightly cumbersome, is clear. The background information is sound, but its real strength is in the \"Methodology and Pre-Test\" section. The student proactively identifies a key problem\u2014the unknown concentration of commercial bleach\u2014and details a preliminary titration experiment to standardize it. This demonstrates foresight and a sophisticated understanding of experimental procedure. Furthermore, Essay B includes an outstanding table of controlled variables with detailed justifications and a comprehensive safety assessment that includes specific chemical hazards and environmental considerations. While Essay A's theoretical background is slightly more focused, Essay B's superior demonstration of planning, control, and safety makes it the stronger submission for Criterion B.",
