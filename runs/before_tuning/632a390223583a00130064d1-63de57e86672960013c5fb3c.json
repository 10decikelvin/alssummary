  "reasoning": "Both essays demonstrate a strong understanding of the requirements for Criterion B, presenting well-focused research questions, detailed methodologies, and thorough consideration of variables and risks. Essay A is commendable for its sophisticated approach to data collection, planning to use a LabQuest 2 and Tracker software to accurately determine Young's Modulus. Its use of tables to clearly delineate controlled and uncontrolled variables is excellent, and the inclusion of an ethical consideration regarding the use of food materials is a mark of a thoughtful student.\n\nHowever, Essay B is superior due to its more robust and scientifically grounded background research. The author of Essay B not only explains the principles of electroplating but also explicitly connects the independent variable (voltage) to the dependent variable (mass increase) through established scientific principles like Faraday's first law of electrolysis, citing that \"Increasing the voltage in the circuit will increase current...Once the current increases, the amount of metal plated onto the cathode increases in direct proportion.\" This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the hypothesis. In contrast, Essay A fails to provide a clear chemical or physical explanation for *why* changing the concentration of sodium bicarbonate would affect the Young's Modulus of the bioplastic, which is a significant omission in the background section.\n\nFurthermore, Essay B justifies its chosen range of the independent variable by referencing common practices in jewellery making and explicitly stating the intent to test beyond that range. This demonstrates a higher level of critical thinking in the experimental design. While both methodologies are detailed, Essay B's comprehensive discussion of theory, citation of previous studies, and clear justification for its variables make it the stronger example of scientific exploration.",
