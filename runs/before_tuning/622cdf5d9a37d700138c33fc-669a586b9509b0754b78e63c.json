  "reasoning": "Essay A demonstrates a significantly higher level of exploration, which is the core of Criterion B. Its research question, investigating the Maillard reaction in baked goods, is highly original, complex, and stems from clear personal engagement (\"As someone who was interested in cooking...\"). The background research is outstanding; the student not only explains the complex biochemistry of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) but also situates their work within existing scientific literature, citing Toyosaki et al. and identifying a specific gap in the research\u2014the transition from \"model foods\" to \"real food.\" This justification provides a strong, scholarly foundation for the investigation. The methodology, involving dough preparation, buffer extraction, and colorimetry, is sophisticated and well-suited to the advanced research question.\n\nIn contrast, Essay B's investigation into how acid concentration affects the rate of reaction with an antacid is a very standard and common high school kinetics experiment. While the research question is well-defined and the personal connection to pharmacology is stated, it lacks the novelty and depth of Essay A. The background information on collision theory and neutralization is correct but generic and does not engage with scientific literature to the same extent. Essay B does have a more thorough risk assessment and environmental consideration section, which is a notable strength. However, the overall quality of the exploration in Essay A\u2014its originality, the depth of its scientific context, and the complexity of its methodology\u2014is far superior and more aligned with the aims of an independent scientific investigation.",
