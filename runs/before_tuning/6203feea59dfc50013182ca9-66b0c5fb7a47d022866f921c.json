  "reasoning": "Essay B demonstrates a higher level of quality for Criterion B. While both essays present clear, focused research questions and show good personal engagement, Essay B's planning is significantly more thorough and scientifically rigorous. For instance, its justification for the chosen independent variable values is excellent, directly linking the concentrations (E10, E85) to real-world applications: \"As E10 is the by far the most used form of gasohol in Australia, it is logical to start with it... E85 is an exception to this and has been used due to the real-world context and relevance of this fuel.\" Essay A's method for altering its independent variable is comparatively vague, simply stating \"by adding 6 drops of HCl.\" Furthermore, Essay B's table of controlled variables is superior, not only identifying the variables but also explicitly explaining *why* they must be controlled and *how* this will be achieved. The safety and environmental considerations in Essay B are also more specific and robust, correctly identifying the need for a fume cupboard and proper chemical waste disposal, whereas Essay A suggests a less appropriate disposal method. Finally, Essay B's inclusion of a dedicated section on \"Assumptions made\" and \"Limitations\" showcases a deeper level of critical thinking about the experimental design, which is a key component of a high-scoring exploration. Essay A is competent, but Essay B excels in its detail, justification, and foresight.",
