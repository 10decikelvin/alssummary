  "decision": "essay1",
  "reasoning": "Essay A presents a more methodologically sound and sophisticated exploration. Its two-part research question is ambitious and clearly delineates the investigation into two distinct but related areas: the effect of carbon chain length and the effect of isomer classification on the enthalpy of combustion. The variables section is exemplary, correctly identifying the two independent variables and providing a comprehensive list of controlled variables with robust justifications for their control, for example, controlling the \"Calorimeter\" because \"different calorimeters may possess different specific heat capacities.\" This demonstrates a high level of forethought in the experimental design. The procedure is detailed and replicable, covering all necessary steps for a calorimetry experiment.\n\nEssay B, while also strong, has a notable weakness in its experimental design. The research question is clear, but the variables section incorrectly lists \"Type of juice\" as a controlled variable. This is a second independent variable, and miscategorizing it suggests a less-than-complete understanding of experimental design principles. While the background information in Essay B is excellent, and its consideration of safety, ethical, and environmental issues is more comprehensive than Essay A's, this fundamental flaw in variable identification is significant for Criterion B. Essay A's design, involving twelve different alcohols to test two separate hypotheses, is more complex and demonstrates a superior grasp of how to structure a scientific investigation. Therefore, despite Essay B's strengths, Essay A's superior experimental design and variable handling make it the better submission for this criterion.",
