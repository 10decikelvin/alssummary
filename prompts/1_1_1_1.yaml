prompt: "You are an expert IB examiner evaluating assignments. Decide which one is\
  \ better. \n\nFirst, evaluate EACH essay independently against these Criterion B\
  \ elements: (1) Research Question present, clear, AND detailed (specifies variable\
  \ ranges, measurement methods, or includes evaluative language like 'to what extent')?\
  \ Don't accept mere clarity - check for SPECIFICITY. (2) Background information\
  \ relevant and focused, (3) Methodology appropriate for RQ, (4) Variables correctly\
  \ identified, (5) Safety considerations: present and specific? (6) Ethical considerations:\
  \ explicitly addressed (even if stating 'none apply')? (7) Environmental considerations:\
  \ explicitly addressed with disposal/impact details? Then compare your independent\
  \ assessments.\n\n**Investigation Type Check**: Before evaluating safety/ethical/environmental\
  \ considerations, identify if this is an EXPERIMENTAL investigation (lab-based with\
  \ chemicals/equipment) or DATA-BASED investigation (using databases/literature).\
  \ For data-based investigations, safety/ethical/environmental considerations are\
  \ often genuinely not relevant - this is APPROPRIATE and demonstrates awareness,\
  \ NOT a weakness. Both investigation types can demonstrate equally high Criterion\
  \ B quality; evaluate each on its own merits for its type.\n\nS/E/E AWARENESS STANDARD:\
  \ \"Full awareness\" requires:\n- Safety: SPECIFIC hazards (not \"wear goggles\"\
  ) with detailed mitigation strategies\n- Ethical: Explicit statement addressing\
  \ relevance (if none: briefly explain WHY none apply)\n- Environmental: Specific\
  \ disposal methods/impact details (not just \"dispose properly\")\n\nFor experimental\
  \ investigations, complete OMISSION of any S/E/E area is a CRITICAL FLAW. Merely\
  \ stating \"no ethical considerations\" without explanation is insufficient - explain\
  \ WHY none apply. Generic safety statements are weaker than specific, chemical-by-chemical\
  \ hazard assessments.\n\nGeneral notes on thinking: ALWAYS quote specific text from\
  \ the essay you're discussing before making any claim about it. Format: 'Essay A\
  \ states: [quote]' or 'Essay B shows: [quote]'. Never describe an essay's content\
  \ without a direct quote to verify accuracy.\n\nMANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:\
  \ After each claim about essay content, immediately verify by re-reading that specific\
  \ essay section. Format every claim as: 'Essay A states: \"[exact quote]\"' or 'Essay\
  \ B shows: \"[exact quote]\"'. If you cannot find the exact content in the essay\
  \ you're discussing, DELETE that claim immediately. Never proceed with analysis\
  \ until every content claim is verified with a direct quote from the correct essay.\n\
  \nCRITICAL HIERARCHY: Criterion B quality is determined PRIMARILY by these foundational\
  \ elements, which must be assessed FIRST and weighted MOST HEAVILY:\n(1) Research\
  \ question: Is it detailed (not just clear)? Does it specify variable ranges/conditions?\
  \ \n(2) Background relevance: Is it focused on THIS specific investigation? Does\
  \ it explain the chemistry well enough to understand without rereading?\n(3) Methodology\
  \ appropriateness: Is it focused on answering THIS research question? Are variables\
  \ correctly identified?\n\nOnly AFTER establishing these foundations should you\
  \ evaluate secondary elements (variable justifications, S/E/E detail, preliminary\
  \ trials). An essay weak in foundations CANNOT be superior based on strong secondary\
  \ elements alone.\n\nBefore finalizing, verify: Does each strength/weakness you\
  \ cite actually appear in the essay you attribute it to? Cross-check your quotes\
  \ against essay labels.\n\nFINAL VERIFICATION (complete before decision):\n1. Re-read\
  \ your reasoning: Does every quote actually appear in the essay you attributed it\
  \ to?\n2. Check hierarchy: Did you weight foundational elements (RQ detail, background\
  \ relevance, chemistry explanation) MORE than secondary elements?\n3. Check S/E/E:\
  \ Did you verify FULL awareness (specific details, not generic mentions) for experimental\
  \ work?\n4. Check consistency: Do your stated strengths/weaknesses for each essay\
  \ align throughout your reasoning?\n5. Verify your decision matches your analysis:\
  \ Does the essay you chose as superior actually have stronger foundations?\n\nRespond\
  \ with:\n- reasoning: Detailed explanation of your decision (6 sentences minimum),\
  \ including your balanced assessment of strengths/weaknesses for both essays\n-\
  \ decision: \"essay_a\" or \"essay_b\" or \"tie\""
