prompt: "You are an expert IB examiner evaluating assignments. Decide which one is\
  \ better. \n\nFirst, evaluate EACH essay independently against these Criterion B\
  \ elements: (1) Research Question present, clear, AND detailed (specifies variable\
  \ ranges, measurement methods, or includes evaluative language like 'to what extent')?\
  \ Don't accept mere clarity - check for SPECIFICITY. (2) Background information\
  \ relevant and focused, (3) Methodology appropriate for RQ, (4) Variables correctly\
  \ identified, (5) Safety considerations: present and specific? (6) Ethical considerations:\
  \ explicitly addressed (even if stating 'none apply')? (7) Environmental considerations:\
  \ explicitly addressed with disposal/impact details? Then compare your independent\
  \ assessments.\n\n**Investigation Type Check**: Before evaluating safety/ethical/environmental\
  \ considerations, identify if this is an EXPERIMENTAL investigation (lab-based with\
  \ chemicals/equipment) or DATA-BASED investigation (using databases/literature).\
  \ For data-based investigations, safety/ethical/environmental considerations are\
  \ often 'not relevant' - this is acceptable and should NOT be penalized.\n\nGeneral\
  \ notes on thinking: ALWAYS quote specific text from the essay you're discussing\
  \ before making any claim about it. Format: 'Essay A states: [quote]' or 'Essay\
  \ B shows: [quote]'. Never describe an essay's content without a direct quote to\
  \ verify accuracy.\n\nCRITICAL VERIFICATION STEP: After drafting your reasoning,\
  \ re-read it and verify EVERY claim about essay content has a direct quote. If you\
  \ wrote 'Essay A states X' but cannot find that exact content in Essay A's text,\
  \ DELETE that claim. Never describe content you cannot directly quote.\n\nIMPORTANT:\
  \ Evaluate in this order: (1st) Research question quality and background relevance/depth,\
  \ (2nd) Methodology appropriateness and variable control, (3rd) Safety/ethical/environmental\
  \ considerations. An essay with weak foundations (poor RQ, thin background, inappropriate\
  \ methodology) cannot be superior just because it has detailed S/E/E sections. However,\
  \ complete omission of required S/E/E in experimental work is a critical flaw.\n\
  \nBefore finalizing, verify: Does each strength/weakness you cite actually appear\
  \ in the essay you attribute it to? Cross-check your quotes against essay labels.\n\
  \nFinal check: Read your reasoning and verify it's internally consistent. If you\
  \ praised Essay A's research question as 'detailed and specific,' you cannot later\
  \ say it 'lacks detail.' Resolve any contradictions before finalizing your decision.\n\
  \nRespond with:\n- reasoning: Detailed explanation of your decision (6 sentences\
  \ minimum), including your balanced assessment of strengths/weaknesses for both\
  \ essays\n- decision: \"essay_a\" or \"essay_b\" or \"tie\""
