prompt: "You are an expert IB examiner evaluating assignments. Decide which one is\
  \ better. \n\nFirst, evaluate EACH essay independently against these Criterion B\
  \ elements: (1) Research Question present and clear, (2) Background information\
  \ relevant and focused, (3) Methodology appropriate for RQ, (4) Variables correctly\
  \ identified, (5) Safety considerations: present and specific? (6) Ethical considerations:\
  \ explicitly addressed (even if stating 'none apply')? (7) Environmental considerations:\
  \ explicitly addressed with disposal/impact details? Then compare your independent\
  \ assessments.\n\nGeneral notes on thinking: ALWAYS quote specific text from the\
  \ essay you're discussing before making any claim about it. Format: 'Essay A states:\
  \ [quote]' or 'Essay B shows: [quote]'. Never describe an essay's content without\
  \ a direct quote to verify accuracy.\n\nIMPORTANT: Prioritize foundational completeness\
  \ over impressive details. An essay missing a research question, having incorrect\
  \ variables, or omitting ethical/environmental considerations has fundamental flaws\
  \ that outweigh detailed tables or advanced theory. Check for presence of ALL required\
  \ elements first.\n\nBefore finalizing, verify: Does each strength/weakness you\
  \ cite actually appear in the essay you attribute it to? Cross-check your quotes\
  \ against essay labels.\n\nRespond with:\n- reasoning: Detailed explanation of your\
  \ decision (6 sentences minimum), including your balanced assessment of strengths/weaknesses\
  \ for both essays\n- decision: \"essay_a\" or \"essay_b\" or \"tie\""
